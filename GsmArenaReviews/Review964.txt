			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One is certainly one of the smartphones of the year and has come a long way towards helping the Taiwanese company out of its financial woes. It was only logical then that HTC will try to capitalize on that success by bringing the same formula to other parts of its portfolio. We already got the upscaled version with the Butterfly S, so now it's time to shrink the design with the HC One mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over the last few years large phones (that grow ever bigger) have managed to claim a monopoly on good specs it seems, which made many (including quite a few members of our team, we even started a petition) yearn for a compact, but premium Android. The Galaxy S4 (the arch rival of the One) already got its mini version, but that one made too great a compromise with the screen. Let's see if HTC has done better.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC One mini at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Some might frown at the idea that a 4.3" smartphone qualifies as mini, but the truth is this size hits a sweet spot. It has enough screen estate to provide enjoyable multimedia and gaming experience as well as enable decent productivity, yet it still allows a smartphone to fit into virtually every pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the 720p resolution is just right too - the Galaxy S4 mini screen is also 4.3" big but the qHD resolution and 256ppi pixel density spoil the premium feel somewhat. The plastic body didn't help the One mini competitor either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is important - there are plenty of mid-range reasonably compact phones already. What we want (and really hope HTC has delivered here) is a compact phone with high-end specs. The HTC One mini spells out premium with an aluminum unibody design and UltraPixel camera with dedicated ImageChip 2, plus BoomSound (stereo speakers on the front with a dedicated amp).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has delivered the best software it has too - Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean out of the box with Sense 5. The Sense customizations include the BlinkFeed news and social media aggregator, Zoe camera and Video highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Could this be it? The dream phone with good specs, without a huge screen you have to overpay for, even when you don't want it in the first place? At first glance there are only a couple of things that might prevent the HTC One mini from achieving glory. It has a lesser chipset (1.4GHz dual-core Krait CPU, 1GB RAM) compared to both the original One and the Galaxy S4 mini and its storage is limited (just 16GB with no option for expansion).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We only got one short day with it, so we are not sure we'll be able to answer all questions, but we'll do all we can to cover as much of the hardware and software of the HTC One mini as possible. Join us after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini is little else, but a downscaled One on the outside - premium aluminum, with the solid feel of a unibody phone all whipped into an attractive design. While the 5" Butterfly S went with polycarbonate (perhaps due to weight considerations), the HTC One mini should earn as much praise for its design as the regular One did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One mini measures 132 x 63.2 x 9.3mm or about 5mm smaller than the One in the width and height dimensions. It's also lighter by about 20g too, it weighs 122g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mini also differs from the One in the polycarbonate strip that runs along the sides of the phone. The regular One has it too, but the one on the mini is thicker, covering the entire sides. We think this is an advantage - plastic can take a knock, while aluminum is more brittle (it dents and its paint peels off more easily when hit). And the polycarbonate plastic is nice enough to keep the premium feel, so if anything the mini is an upgrade over the full-sized One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the HTC One mini follows the established design used by the regular One and the Butterfly S. It's The whole front panel is protected by Gorilla Glass 3, there are two capacitive keys below the screen - Back and Home - and a speaker on either side of the display. Next to the top speaker is the front-facing camera (1.6MP / 720p) along with proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the 4.2.2 software, you can long press the Home key to activate the Menu, instead of having an on-screen button that eats into the usable screen space. The HTC One got this as an update, but the mini stood in the R&amp;D lab long enough to get it out of the box (actually, it was part of the pre-release software for the One too, until HTC decided to remove it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is gorgeous - it's not quite as sharp as the 1080p screen on the One, but at this size spotting the difference takes some effort. It has great viewing angles and great colors too. Overall, we find the screen is worthy of the One name, unlike the uninspiring qHD unit of the Galaxy S4 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the HTC One mini features the Power/Lock key (sorry, no IR function this time around), the 3.5mm audio jack and one of the two mics. The bottom of the phone holds the second mic along with the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two mics are used for stereo recording in videos but work with Sense Voice too. This feature keeps track of how loud the environment is during a call and ups the gain on the mic to make sure the other side can hear you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the One mini is where the microSIM card tray goes. The right side has two volume buttons, an uncommon design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We get to the back. Aluminum spans the entire surface (save for two thin plastic strips) and comes in either naked metallic grey or in painted black (at launch anyway, we might see a Red version later on). The camera and its flash are the main attractions on the back, but the Beats Audio logo reminds you that the phone provides a high-end audio experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, back to the camera. It has a 1/3" UltraPixel sensor with 4MP resolution (16:9 aspect ratio). UltraPixel refers to the larger than usual pixels on the sensor - 2 microns on a side, bigger than the standard 1.4 micron and 1.1 micron pixels in most other cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big pixels, Backside Illuminated (BSI) sensor design and fast F/2.0 lens promise great low-light performance. The LED flash can be fired in one of five power levels, depending on how close you are to your subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the HTC One mini uses the same ImageChip 2 as the big One. This chip handles a lot of the special processing needed by the camera (so the less powerful chipset shouldn't matter), including recording 3 second videos each time you take a photo in Zoe mode. These videos are stitched into cool 30 second Video highlights. The chip also records what is necessary for the Always Smile and Object Removal options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's missing is the Optical Image Stabilization - outside the flagship Nokia Lumia phones, the HTC One was the only phone to offer it. It remains its exclusive feature though as even the big HTC Butterfly S doesn't have it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cutting down "only" 5mm from the height and width of the HTC One to make the mini might not sound like much, but that's because it's difficult to picture. In reality, the One mini feels noticeably more compact than its bigger siblings. It's roughly the size of last year's HTC One S, which is impressive as you are getting a pair of stereo speakers at the front.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini runs Android 4.2.2 with Sense 5, puts it on par with the big One. The software includes the exclusive BlinkFeed and Zoe features. Here's a quick showcase of the HTC One mini hardware and software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Sense goes against the grain of most Android custom launcherss and relies a lot on vertical scrolling, which can take some getting used to if you're coming from another phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is the first place you encounter it - it's a stream of interesting articles from around the web (HTC has partnered with 10,000 providers) combined with social networking updates for your accounts on sites like Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap on an item you get a preview with one big picture and a short blurb. Social networking items open the respective app instead. You can also search BlinkFeed and post updates to social networks straight from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that BlinkFeed will use some data to update, but you can set it to update over Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is a part of the homescreen - the leftmost pane. You get to it by hitting the Home key and get out of either by swiping left to move to standard-looking Android homescreen panes or by tapping the app drawer button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is the second place where HTC went with vertical scrolling instead of the more popular paged interface. The drawer displays a 3 x 4 grip of shortcuts by default (which leaves a lot of padding around icons). You can use folders to group similar apps and make better use of the screen space. The other option is to switch to a 4 x 5 grid from the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that to access the settings in the app drawer and BlinkFeed you have to swipe down. The One mini doesn't have a Menu button, but you can set the long press action of the Home button to substitute it. If you do that, its default function of opening Google Now is moved to a swipe up gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the app drawer is a big clock with date and weather info (a big icon and smaller text with more details). This same clock is at the top of the BlinkFeed screen, which makes the two feel very similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcut dock at the bottom holds four shortcuts plus the app drawer button in the middle. These icons are always visible - in BlinkFeed, in the regular screens, in the app drawer, even the lockscreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The notification area is pretty much stock android - it shows only notifications by default (below the top row, which is reserved for the time and date, plus two shortcuts). As of Android 4.2.2 Sense 5 also has toggles in the notification area, which you can access through a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty courtesy of Android 4.2.2 is the widget lockscreen. It's disabled by default, you have to toggle it on from the Personalize menu. Unlike the stock implementation, you only get to pick a single widget, there are no multiple pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't have time to run benchmarks, but in the time we used the One mini it felt smooth. The processing power available is slightly disappointing though - two Krait 300 CPU cores at 1.4GHz and only 1GB of RAM. The Adreno 305 GPU should be okay on 720p resolution, but the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini has a higher clocked chipset (1.7GHz, up 20%) and 1.5GB of RAM (50% more).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we wrap up the software overview, we'll cover the connectivity options of the HTC One mini. It packs all the basics - 2G, 3G with HSPA, LTE, Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and GPS+GLONASS. There are a couple of things missing though - there's no fast 802.11ac Wi-Fi or NFC. The MHL and USB host functionality has been removed from the USB port too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini has an UltraPixel camera with Zoe very similar to what the regular One has. The one difference is the lack of Optical Image Stabilization. Other than that, you can do the same tricks with the One mini you can with the One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera viewfinder fits perfectly on the 16:9 screen as that's the aspect ratio of the sensor too. There are two virtual shutter keys - one for photos and one for videos. A button on the other side of the screen toggles Zoe on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe is what enables the One mini to do many of its impressive tricks - like taking a burst shot and removing objects that have moved or making sure everyone in the photo is smiling. It also captures 3 seconds of video, which is later used to create 30 seconds of Video highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Be aware that because of the extra information that the camera captures in Zoe mode, you use up a good deal storage with every shot, which is when you only have 12GB available (from the 16GB total). You can use one of the auto-upload services to back up your photos and free up some space - the One mini comes with 25GB of free Dropbox storage for 2 years. Another option to upload and share your photos is HTC Share, which also supports Video highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera captures 4MP images and can record 1080p video, with HDR modes for both. You can also switch to the 1.6MP / 720p front-facing camera. You can also record 60fps videos (at 720p), which you can play back at different speeds for either HFR or slow-motion effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For low-light shots, the camera's LED flash has a feature called Smart Flash that adjust the power of the flash between 5 settings, depending on how close you are to what you're photographing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We like the mini trend - a taste of premium features in a compact package. The HTC One mini faithfully recreates one of the best mobile phone designs ever and does it without shedding too many features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC One Mini ? HTC One ? HTC Butterfly S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We quite like the screen - 1080p would have been overkill on a 4.3" screen, a waste of GPU and battery power. 720p is just right (it results in slightly above Retina display sharpness) and, more importantly, the quality of the panel is great too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UltraPixel camera certainly has its fair share of fans and haters, sacrificing daylight detail for low-light performance. But it's good to see HTC didn't cut corners and gave the mini the same treatment as the One - it slapped on the ImageChip 2, which powers the image processing magic that goes on. We do miss the Optical Image Stabilization though, it really made the One camera stand out ahead of other Androids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we saw the One mini specs we were somewhat disappointed by the chipset. We like the Snapdragon 400 with two Krait cores, it successfully tackles last year's quad-core Cortex-A9 chipsets, but most of the time it's clocked at 1.7GHz, not 1.4GHz. That's a 20% difference in clock speed compared to the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini. However, the One mini turned out to be a smooth performer and even if the loading times aren't always the best, it certainly doesn't feel underpowered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16GB of non-expandable storage is probably our biggest concern, but the base iPhone is usually a 16GB model and that's what the majority of people end up buying, so it won't be a deal breaker for many.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upside, the HTC One mini launches with Android 4.2.2 out of the box along with HTC unique touch to the user interface and has the BoomSound stereo speakers on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess the question then is how does it stack up against the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini? The aluminum unibody beats the plastic hands down in terms of premium feel and the screen scores high points for the One mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the camera - even without OIS, the 4MP UltraPixel camera has a much easier time competing with the 8MP module in the S4 mini than it does against the 13MP shooter in the big Galaxy S4. The S4 mini does have LTE (market dependent), NFC and a faster chipset, plus expandable storage and IR blaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the biggest argument in favor of the Samsung is that it''s noticeably more compact despite the same screen size - 124.6 x 61.3 x 8.9 mm, 107g for the S4 mini vs. 132 x 63.2 x 9.3mm, 122g for the One mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9190 Galaxy S4 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we had to put things on a scale, we say the Galaxy S4 mini is closer to a mid-range phone - a very good mid-range phone, but still. The HTC One mini, however, did a better job of evoking the feel of a premium flagship even if it's not as much of a "mini" as its rival.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one lingering questions - how will the chipset age? Will the next major Android update run fine on 1GB of RAM and for that matter will HTC even update the One mini? Last year's One S, the spiritual predecessor of the mini and with very similar specs most likely won't see Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, it would be a shame for the One mini to follow in its footsteps.</paragraph>
