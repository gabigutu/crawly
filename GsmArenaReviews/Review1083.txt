			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Spreading the Galaxy S III magic to as many market segments as possible is what Samsung is actively trying to achieve these days. After the power users were treated to the Note II and those looking for a premium experience in a compact shell got the mini, it's now time for the mid-range market to get some attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier specs sheet is familiar with the 4.65-inch Super AMOLED touchscreen and the dual-core TI OMAP chipset immediately bringing the Galaxy Nexus to mind. However, calling the Premier a Nexus refresh is wildly inaccurate - the Nature UX adds so much character that you'll hardly be able to tell there's so much in common between the two smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's take a look at what the Galaxy Premier is all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, the Samsung Galaxy Premier doesn't have the most exciting specs sheet around, but it takes a formula that was already proven to work and improves on it in a number of key areas. Building on the most popular Nexus smartphone so far, the Premier addresses just about every complaints users had about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mediocre camera is replaced by a more capable 8MP shooter, the chipset got a speed update and a more powerful GPU, while the uninspiring styling got spiced up with a dash of Galaxy S III. There is also an ampler battery to take care of the relatively short endurance and a microSD card slot for cheap memory expansion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yes, the stock Android looks are gone, but they are replaced by the Nature UX, which is not only way more functional, but also the best looking TouchWiz version so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's see if all those tweaks actually look as promised - the hardware inspection starts right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Premier I9260 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Standing at 134.2 x 68 x 9 mm, the Galaxy Premier is virtually identical to the Galaxy Nexus. However since there are no curves or chins here, the Galaxy Premier actually feels way more compact. Overall it's not the most compact smartphone in the world, but it's not too big either and it's generally pleasant to hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier weighs 130g, which is 5g lighter than the Galaxy Nexus. Impressive, considering that there's a larger battery and a microSD card slot here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You don't need to think very hard to realize what inspired the Samsung Galaxy Premier design. The smartphone looks very close to its bigger brother, the Galaxy S III. The only difference, aside from a slightly smaller footprint is the fact that the Galaxy Premier uses a regular glossy plastic on its back, instead of the hyperglaze material that the Galaxy S III employs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the screen there's a 1.9MP camera, a proximity sensor and an ambient light sensor. Next to them is the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the familiar three-button combo - a hardware home button in the middle with two capacitive keys on either side for Menu and Back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone features only the power button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side you'll find only the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm headphone jack is placed at the top of the device, alongside the secondary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port and the mouthpiece are at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary 8 MP camera of the Samsung Galaxy Premier comes equipped with a single LED flash. There's also a loudspeaker grille at the back. The battery cover has a delicate rubbery feel to it for an excellent feel in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping the back cover open reveals the 2100 mAh battery. Above it reside the microSIM and microSD card slots. We are currently running our usual battery tests on the Samsung Galaxy Premier and you should check back with us tomorrow for the results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've conducted our battery test on the Samsung Galaxy Premier and the results are quite good, especially where video playback is concerned. If you do an hour of talking, web browsing and watching video you'd need to hook up the phone to a power source every 51 hours. For the full breakdown, go here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display on the Galaxy Premier is a 4.65" Super AMOLED unit with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels, resulting in a density of approximately 316 pixels per inch. The specs might be identical to what we had a year ago, but this still remains the most pixel dense AMOLED screen out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual for AMOLED display, colors are vibrant and contrast is impressively high. Unlike the Galaxy Nexus, the Galaxy Premier offers three display modes, which lets you tune down the colors if you don't like the default oversaturated look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness of the screen isn't particularly impressive, but the Galaxy Premier is still brighter than the Galaxy Nexus, so it's definitely a step in the right direction. And given that Super AMOLED displays are pretty resistant to reflections, the sunlight legibility of the Galaxy Nexus is pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the Samsung Galaxy Premier results from our display tests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Overall, the handling of the Samsung Galaxy Premier is a very pleasant experience. It's just big enough to remain comfortable to hold in one hand. The plastic finish is of high quality and is quite enjoyable to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a certain charisma to the Samsung Galaxy Premier - it's both good looking and solidly built. Samsung seems to be adopting the premium design of the Galaxy S III in both its entry- and mid-range products and the result is an elegant device, which is done just right, without being overdesigned.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The latest Android interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as Android Jelly Bean goes, Samsung's TouchWiz offers one of the most feature rich experiences around, and the Samsung Galaxy Premier is no exception - the Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean build it sports is one of the best around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a look at the interface in action, check out our brief video here:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is very much like what you'll see on the Galaxy S III, after the Jelly Bean update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the standard one we've become used to from Samsung since the introduction of the Nature UX on the Galaxy S III, and can be tapped and dragged in any direction to unlock, with ripples accompanied by a water-drop sound as you drag your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Five customizable shortcuts are available at the bottom of the screen - drag one up to launch the app without going through the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several options for the unlock screen. You can enable a news ticker at the bottom of the lockscreen, which is a great way to stay up to date on current events. The ticker can be expanded to view all news items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are alternative unlock routines as well - Face and voice unlock, unlock by touching the screen and tilting the phone and starting the camera from the lockscreen by touching the screen and rotating the phone horizontally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are voice-based wakeup commands that can start S Voice or launch a preselected app. You can also enable a second clock on the lockscreen which shows up when you're roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick glance is a new feature that presents at-a-glance info on the basics - while the phone is locked, you can cover the top of the Galaxy Premier (just trigger the proximity sensor, really) and the screen will light up and display the status bar, counters for missed calls and new messages, a battery percentage, music track info and upcoming alarms. In our unit, this would trigger even if the smartphone is face down, so it might prove to be a battery draining feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you make it past the lockscreen, you'll notice that the dock at the bottom of the screen now fits five shortcuts or folders. The rightmost one opens the app drawer as usual, but you can change the other four to any shortcut you like or even folders if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area looks familiar, but there are a few new things that make good use of the screen size. On top is a clock with the date and a Settings shortcut. Below that are the usual toggles - Wi-Fi, GPS, Silent mode, Screen rotation and Power saving. There are five more toggles just off screen - Blocking mode (we'll get to that later) Mobile data, Bluetooth, AllShare Cast and Sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further down we get the Brightness slider with an Auto checkbox. It allows you to adjust the brightness even in auto mode - the backlight strength is still adjusted according to ambient lighting conditions, but you can tweak it to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications are one of the big changes in Jelly Bean. Notifications can now take more than a single row to display more information and they can also have more advanced controls on them (e.g. a reply button). The top notification is expanded by default and you can expand/collapse notifications with a two finger swipe up or down (not all notifications can be expanded though - only those that support it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, at the very bottom of the screen you get a line for the carrier ID, which turns into "No service" if there's no mobile network available and "No internet connection" when there's no Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the dock at the bottom fits five icons, the homescreen fits only four on a row. However, the app drawer is a 5 x 5 grid, so you still get more shortcuts per page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following convention from stock Android, the app drawer has a tab that lets you easily pull out widgets to the homescreen. Unlike the stock app drawer, you cannot move between tabs by swiping through the pages - you have to explicitly hit the tab. There's a download shortcut on the right, which brings you to a screen with only the downloaded apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has three view modes - Customizable grid (where you can freely rearrange icons), Alphabetical grid (if you think you can find apps quicker if they're alphabetized) and Alphabetical list (this one makes shortcuts easy to hit, but isn't very space efficient).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has a zoomed-out overview that lets you rearrange pages, but you can't create blanks. Hitting the menu key reveals some more options, including hiding apps or enabling tap-to-uninstall mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's a vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. Swiping an app sideways removes it from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few Samsung-made tweaks here - a button at the bottom of the list to bring out the home-brewed task manager, a button to end all apps at once and a shortcut to Google Now. By the way, you can also bring up Now by pressing and holding the Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go back to the homescreen and widgets. Jelly Bean comes with plenty of them and Samsung has added more still. With Android 4.1, the widgets will move out of the way if you try and put something over them, which makes reorganizing the homescreen so much easier. Some widgets are resizable too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and easily manage homescreen panes - you can add, delete or just reorder them. You can have 7 panes at most, which are enough to fit plenty of content even if you use full-screen widgets. One of these panes is marked "default" and that will be the one you're taken to when you press the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live wallpapers are a great way to not only prettify your homescreen, but also make it useful too. The News wall creates an attractive slideshow of headlines, while Stock wall does the same for quotes. Photo wall creates a collage of photos from your Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a setting called Mode change - basically, it gives you two separate homescreen setups, Basic and Easy. Samsung's idea is to give you big, easy to use widgets that cover most of the functionality with Easy mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing stopping you from adding back the regular widgets in Easy mode, so you can use Mode change to toggle between personal and work widget setups. You can't rename the modes or have more than two, but it's a potentially useful feature if your precious few homescreens are usually cluttered with a widget for your work email, work calendar and so on, and you want your personal email and photo widget instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the features that debuted on the Galaxy S III is Smart Stay - it uses the front-facing camera to detect the user looking at the screen, so that it never dims or locks while you're reading. This makes reading web pages and ebooks very comfortable, even if you've set the screen timeout low to preserve the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the latest TouchWiz comes another clever camera trick - Smart rotation. When enabled, the Galaxy Premier will try to orient its screen in relation to your eyes, not the accelerometer. So, if you're lying on your side and holding the phone vertically (in relation to the ground), Smart rotation will keep the screen in landscape mode. Note that for these last two features to work, the front-facing camera needs to see your face, so too dark environments might turn out to be a problem.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung released S Voice as an answer to Siri before Google came out with its own solution in Google Now. S Voice is the culmination of Samsung's ongoing effort at integrating voice commands into the Android experience, an effort which goes back to the days of Vlingo. You may remember the voice activation (saying "Hi Galaxy" to trigger S Voice).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice can do the usual - search the web, make calls, send texts (which Android natively supports and so does Vlingo), but you can also use it instead of the notification area toggles, answer or reject incoming calls, start the camera and take a photo, control the music player and FM radio and stop or snooze alarms all with voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also a tool for quickly looking up facts - it's powered by Wolfram Alpha (which handles some of Siri's answers too). It has an enormous database covering topics ranging from Culture and Media to Physics. S Voice can also be used as a calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has decided to keep S Voice alongside Google's solution as the two do differ in functionality. Jelly Bean has the unspoken Google Now info cards, but it also brought Google's Knowledge Graph, which can answer factual questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Voice Actions can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Since the latest update came, Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier is powered by a TI OMAP 4470 dual core chipset clocked at 1.5 GHz, 1GB of RAM and a PowerVR SGC544 GPU. In essence, it is a beefed up Samsung Galaxy Nexus with a better GPU, faster CPU and microSD support. Let's see how it does when compared to its predecessor (updated to Jelly Bean), as well as some other popular devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Benchmark Pi, the Premier did very well, beating all Cortex-A9 dual-core competitors. It did come short of the times posted by the dual-core Krait packing smartphones, like the HTC One S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Linpack, the One S retains its title as king of dual-cores, and its Krait processor eclipses the Cortex-A9 on the Galaxy Premier. That being said, the Premier did better than the other dual-core offerings in our benchmarks, including the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new GPU inside the Galaxy Premier shined in NenaMark 2,posting a very impressive score despite the high native resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SunSpider JavaScript benchmark showed some very good browser performance from the Premier. There are few smartphones we have seen do better than that and they all belong to much higher price range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The story continues with BrowserMark, where the Galaxy Premier dominates the mid-range competition in terms of browser performance with some truly impressive numbers for a dual-core CPU.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In multithreaded performance, Krait proves to be better when comparing core for core than the Cortex-A9. However it's a whole different ballgame when looking at web browsing - the Premier is one of the best phones you can have if you spend a lot of time on the internet. Ultimately, when compared to the Nexus, the Galaxy Premier is an improvement in almost every regard.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-in-one phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook packs an incredibly wide range of features and virtually unlimited storage capacity. There are four tabs on top accommodating the Phone app, Groups, Favorites and Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have kept the swipes in the phonebook, enabling quick dialing (right swipe) or sending a text message (left swipe).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contacts feature is there too, displaying, upon a tap on the contact picture, a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, text, email or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all available details, and now shows two tabs instead of four. The first one is the About tab, which shows the person's photo on top. If configured, the right tab displays their latest updates from social networks or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. If the phone book finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt joining them. Furthermore, there're a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has even added a built-in reject list. It acts like a third party blacklist app and blocks the numbers on it from calling you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new feature lets you choose a specific vibration pattern as an incoming call alert, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and, just like the previous version of TouchWiz UI 4.0, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes any unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from those sources as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with smart dialing, voice commands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call quality of the Samsung Galaxy Premier is really good with crisp and loud sound. Reception was also problem-free and we didn't suffer dropped calls though in areas of very poor coverage the sound would occasionally break up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works as advertised - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature that the Samsung Galaxy Premier offers is Direct Call, which lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts or reading/composing a message. Smart alert will vibrate the phone when you pick it up, if there are any missed calls or messages. You can, of course, use the old flip to mute gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too and taken care of by S Voice, which activates on a double tap of the home button. All you need to say is "Hi Galaxy" and speak your command (e.g. "call Dexter"). Or "play" and off it goes. It takes a while to process voice commands but it has more uses than other voice-recognition apps for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Premier. It scored an overall mark of Average, which means you might consider enabling vibration in noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Business-ready messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call. There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box is much bigger - as big as can fit on the screen, we counted 13 rows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can schedule a message to be sent automatically at a later point in time. There's a list of all scheduled messages in case you need to cancel or send a message ahead of time manually. You can also mark certain numbers as "spam", in case some automatic promo texts get pushy, and lock messages to prevent their deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox. Another cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online and messages are displayed as usual, or you can switch to a Gmail-like conversation view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Premier also features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each email account, the app gives you security options (e.g. encrypting outgoing email and signing it with a private key) and a synch schedule, which can be set to check for new mail more often during "peak schedule" (you can pick the days of the week and start and end times when "peak schedule" is active).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. There's also Samsung's own ChatOn service.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input - keyboard, gesture and voice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier comes with several text input options. Yes, there is handwriting recognition using finger gestures, but even the standard on-screen QWERTY has several different layouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a handful of clever tricks that this keyboard can offer. You can swipe left and right on the keyboard to position the cursor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option shows you a list of all recent items in the clipboard (both text and images) that you can quickly paste. This is great as it lets you juggle multiple copied items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also enable "Continuous input", which lets you input words by swiping over the keyboard (yes, like Swype). This is available on the Galaxy S III too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier has very advanced text prediction features to minimize typos. If you allow it, it will scan through your emails, Facebook posts and Twitter posts and learn how you write (which words you use more often and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, use voice input and since the Premier is running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, this will work even if the phone is offline as long as you have downloaded the required language package.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery has some great extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier comes with a new eye-candy-rich Gallery app. It opens up in Albums view, but photos can also be sorted by Location, Time, Person (photos with tagged faces), Group and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also switch between three view modes - rectangular grid, a grid that's spread out in 3D space and a 3D spiral (which is the least useful of all). In each of the three view modes, you can pinch zoom to make the thumbnails bigger. Unlike Sony's gallery, you only get two zoom levels here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find Star, Share and Delete buttons above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also found that unlike other droids, the Galaxy Premier lets you select folders from several different folders for batch operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of features goes on. There are a couple of photo editing options and a crop tool. Contextual tags display labels with the location, who's in the photo and the date (if there's a GPS tag and you've taught the Premier about what your friends look like). Then there's the print option, so you can print out photos without going through a computer first (but you'll need a Samsung printer).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a photo with people's faces in it, the Galaxy Premier will try to detect them automatically (and you can manually highlight faces where it fails). Buddy photo share will use your contacts' profiles to try and recognize who is who automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social tag makes sure that whenever a face is recognized in the photo, their status message appears and you can easily call or message that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option allows you to OCR a photo and copy the text. This is very handy if you often work with documents but don't have a scanner and a computer handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you thought that Samsung didn't include the kitchen sink, the option to add weather tags to a photo (a feature courtesy of AccuWeather) should change your mind. We still can't figure out what the use for that may be, but it's there if you need it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player gets an overhaul<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier uses an updated version of the TouchWiz music player. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted into various categories, but the most interesting one is called Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony Ericsson phones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to move between songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Premier player is DLNA-enabled, so you're not limited to tracks on your handset - songs on devices connected to your Wi-Fi network are as easy to get to as locally stored songs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has put what is easily the best default video player on the Samsung Galaxy Premier. It offers several view modes - grid, list, folders and nearby devices (which accesses DLNA devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is our favorite as it is a true quad-core tour de force - the visible video thumbnails (all eight of them) are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate and generating those previews takes a couple of minutes the first time around, but it's an awesome preview and it's impressive that we can see this on a non-quad-core device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the large, high-res screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it - starting with .WMV, through .AVI (DivX and XviD) and .MP4 to .MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn't a problem either - the Samsung Galaxy Premier played FullHD files and larger files seamlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier made another good impression when it offered us a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Premier has a feature called Pop up play - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. With Jelly Bean, you can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video - we're once again impressed at how well this worked on such a midrange-spec'd device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS, broadcast recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Premier is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 8 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it acts as the antenna. You can record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier did quite well in the first part of our audio quality test. When connected to an active external amplifier the smartphone got excellent scores all over the field, with no weak points whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play the distortion levels rise a bit and the stereo crosstalk spikes, but the rest of the readings remain pretty good. Still, volume levels are no better than average in either case, so the overall performance definitely has some room for improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the numbers and see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Premier's main camera can capture stills of up to 3264 x 2448 pixels and 1080p videos, while the one on the front takes 1.9MP pictures and 720p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is typical for a Samsung droid - a right column with the essential controls (virtual shutter key surrounded by a still/video mode toggle and a gallery shortcut) and a left column with four customizable shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app offers a bounty of features including geotagging, touch focus, HDR mode, Panorama, burst shot (with Best photo), Share shot, face and smile detection with Best faces, low-light mode, digital image stabilization, scenes, effects and several more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Premier can also simultaneously record HD (1080p or 720p) video and take near full-resolution pictures (those are cropped to an aspect ratio of 16:9 to match that of the videos and what's seen in the viewfinder).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Best faces feature snaps a burst of 5 photos, keeping track of people's faces. Later, you can pick any of the 5 photos for each person's face individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier's camera quality is significantly better than that of its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. As expected, Samsung has thrown in the same sensor as found on the Galaxy Note II and Galaxy S III, and although the image processing has been altered slightly the results are still very good. The noise levels are kept down and the amount of resolved detail is quite decent. Colors look good though they are slightly oversaturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples taken with the Premier:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier has plenty of competition in our Photo quality comparison tool as most current flagship shoot stills at 8MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When compared to the Galaxy Note II and Galaxy S III, samples from the three devices are extremely hard to tell apart.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera user interface is identical to that of the still camera. During recording, you can snap 6MP stills and use the pause button to do a multi-part video in the same file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera can apply various effects to the video and there are slow-motion (1/2x) and fast motion (2x) modes. Touch focus during recording is available, with an AF button to switch back to regular continuous autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FullHD videos are recorded in MP4 files with bitrate ranging from 17Mbps to 19Mbps. The framerate is a solid 30fps and the audio is captured in stereo at 48kHz sampling rate and a bitrate of around 130Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the video is slightly worse than that of the Galaxy S III and Note II. There's plenty of detail in the videos and noise is kept well under control, but colors are off and quite oversaturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this 1080p video sample we shot with the Galaxy Premier:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've included a 720p video sample as well:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download the untouched video samples - 1080p@30fps (16s, 34.6MB), 720p@30fps (12s, 17.7MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier shoots 1080p videos and once again they come close to those produced by the Galaxy S III and Note II. The artificial grass looks great and there's even some texture in the blue wallpaper. Contrast is a bit low though and there's more noise in the low-light scene.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full connectivity capabilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier has a long list of connectivity features. Let's start off with the basics - quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G (AWS is missing though). The 3G connectivity is backed by HSPA (21Mbps downlink, 5.76Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers a/b/g/n, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA are part of the package, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 LE, which incorporates Bluetooth 3.0, but also includes the efficient Low Energy mode. It also supports the high-quality Apt-X audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Premier lets you share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the devices back-to-back. You'd need two S Beam-enabled devices to get this to work - while not many models support it, there are plenty of Galaxy S III's around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share with other NFC devices as well, but the functionality is limited to what is provided by Android Beam - Android's stock NFC tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare functionality is now split into two: AllShare Play and AllShare Cast. The first is for transferring and sharing data and multimedia files to your notebook or PC. AllShare Cast on the other hand provides streaming content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. Sadly, there isn't one included in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MHL port has yet another feature - it enables USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (there isn't one in the box) but this one is fairly straight forward - you plug it into the Galaxy Premier and plug a standard USB cable on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just about every USB thumb drives and card reader we tried worked and reading all sorts of cards was problem-free - it even worked with a big CF card. Connecting phones worked pretty well too - we were able to access the memory of a Nokia 808 PureView we had laying around straight from the Galaxy Premier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Awesome web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A new Android version always comes with an improved web browser and the Jelly Bean browser running on the Samsung Galaxy Premier is no exception. Samsung has put its own spin to it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is almost non-existent - just a row at the top of the screen for the back and forward buttons, the URL bar with a refresh button, the tab switching key and the bookmarks key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as text reflow, find on page, save for offline viewing, request desktop site and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which lets you surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another Samsung feature in the browser is the Print option, which lets you print out web pages straight from your phone. Unfortunately, this only works only with Samsung printers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls are our favorite feature of the Android browser and they've gotten even better with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. In case you've missed it, Quick Controls is basically a jog-dial menu that replaces the buttons on the top and appears when you place your finger near the left or right edge of the screen. It's even more minimalist than the regular UI and it's very comfortable to use single-handed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get five controls, but as you highlight one with your finger, it fans out into further options. Tabs, for example, bring out the tab switcher by default, but it also brings out options to open a new tab, a new incognito tab or close the current tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness and colors gives you four different presets to adjust the display. Automatic brightness is an option, too, and works only within the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adobe do not officially support Flash on Jelly Bean, but you can side-load it if you like (1080p YouTube videos worked fine once we did). Still, you'd be better off sticking to the HTML5 versions of web sites - YouTube works and there are even a number of HTML5 games.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier comes with a number of cool apps preinstalled. The one glaring omission is the Office document editor - perhaps Samsung finally came to terms with the sheer amount of free office editors available on the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Memo app comes preinstalled on the Premier as your go-to app for jotting quick notes and reminders. On the Note II, this app was called S Note and featured some neat S pen features like the ability to record your pen gestures and write over anything currently displayed on the screen. As it stands, S Memo comes with a few templates which demonstrate the apps capabilities, as well as the ability to write with your finger, which works quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner is a skinned calendar that is easy to use with your fingers. The tabbed interface lets you easily toggle between year, moth, week, day list and task views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Planner can sync with multiple calendars and you can switch off individual ones to reduce the clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled their new S Cloud service on the Galaxy Premier. It can sync contacts, calendar and S memos and back up logs, messages (SMS and MMS) and the wallpaper. You can choose not to back up some of those things and you can set up automatic backups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Cloud can also hook up to Dropbox. If you do this, photos and videos from your Dropbox account will be synced with the phone's gallery. You can use this feature only over Wi-Fi to save on data usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app features five tabs, each with a different function. The first tab lets you create multiple alarms (each with a distinct repeat time and ring tone), then there are the World clock, stopwatch, timer and desk clock tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator features big buttons, but you can enable one-handed operation to make things more manageable. The text size is adjustable and if you flip the Premier horizontally, you get some advanced math functions too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app lets you browse all the files in your phones' memory or on an attached microSD card. The app is launched automatically when you hook up a USB mass storage device (a USB drive, another phone, an SD card etc), which we find to be a nice touch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Offline Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android Jelly Bean, the Samsung Galaxy Premier has access to the latest apps and the ample built-in memory plus the available microSD slot guarantees you won't have trouble with space. Still, keep in mind that some apps might have issues with JB at first, but those should be ironed out soon enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All the rumors that the Galaxy Premier will be the next Nexus phone didn't pan out, but you can still think of it as an upgraded Galaxy Nexus with S III styling. It doesn't run stock Android and its update schedule will be slower, but it's off to a good start with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Premier is holding middle ground between the company's flagship, the Galaxy S III, and the compact S III mini. On a second thought, raw performance aside, the Galaxy Premier isn't that far behind the Galaxy S III - its 4.65" SuperAMOLED screen and 8MP/1080p camera are virtually as good as what the flagship has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even though the Premier is not quite the benchmark champion, its scores suggest that it can provide a pretty smooth ride and wouldn't choke on resource-intensive apps. Overall, if you're handed a Galaxy Premier and told it's an S III, you might need some time to realize that you're being fooled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's have a look at the alternatives and see if the shared DNA will allow the Premier to hope for the success of the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you were interested in the Galaxy Premier for the Nexus connection, you should look at the Google Nexus 4 - it has the most powerful quad-core processor of all droids and will get fast updates to the latest stock Android. It's dirt cheap too - $350 for the one with 16GB (sadly, non-expandable) storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or you can go with the LG Optimus G, the phone on which the Nexus 4 was based. This gets you more (still non-expandable) storage, but software updates and affordability are another matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Nexus 4 E960 ? LG Optimus G E973</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A RAZR HD from Google-owned Motorola offers a 4.7" 720p Super AMOLED screen, a big 2500mAh battery and cool Kevlar back. That one is bound to offer longer battery life than the Premier, but it's also likely to cost significantly more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Sony Xperia T bets on 4.55" TFT and a 13MP camera. The Bond phone, however, just like the Motorola RAZR HD has ICS at launch and will have to wait for an update to catch up with the Galaxy Premier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola RAZR HD XT925 ? Sony Xperia T</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like what you saw on the Galaxy Premier, but would rather try a difference size, the two obvious alternatives are the Galaxy S III and the S III mini. The big S III does offer two extra CPU cores and the screen is a bit bigger, but neither the screens nor the cameras of the two are that different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III mini has a less capable chipset and a far less impressive screen, but comes with a more attractive price tag and in a more compact package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III ? Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Galaxy Premier, Samsung has the mid-to-high-end market duly covered by phones with a consistent design language and levels of equipment to suit different budgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Premier is not for people who want the best, but it would do well for people who want the best for their money. Nexus or not, the Galaxy Premier is a good-looking and reasonably-equipped phone that has the chance of hitting it big, with the right price tag.</paragraph>
