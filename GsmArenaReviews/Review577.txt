			<paragraph>Being a veteran in the smartphone market is huge advantage when you decide to come up with something new. After so many Windows Mobile and Android devices, HTC surprised us with a completely different product ? HTC Smart. It?s a semi-smartphone that runs on the unusual Brew Mobile platform strengthened with the fancy Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throwing another mobile OS on the market is hardly the right move since the smartphone arena is already over-crowded. But it seems HTC Smart is HTC?s way of making a feature phone. The Linux-based Brew Mobile platform used for the HTC Smart hardly makes it a proper smartphone to boot. Truth is, there are modern touch feature phones that have more ?smart? in them than this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough about software, let?s see what HTC Smart has to offer in terms of hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exploring its features and the possible drawbacks leaves us with mixed first impressions from the HTC Smart. But we are still in the beginning of our Smart meeting and things may still change.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart is a stylish, pocket-friendly device powered by a new OS and skinned with one of the best mobile user interfaces ? the Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us on the next page to see what this Smart is made of.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tiny retail box is not exactly full of stuff but it has the essentials: a charger and a miniUSB cable to use with the charger or to transfer data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the box you'll also find a one-piece headset which isn't your only option though since the HTC Smart is kind enough to offer a 3.5 mm jack. There are no extras obviously, not even a small memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Smart 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The friendly size is a key asset of the HTC Smart. It?s a neat and friendly, and feels surprisingly solid for an all-plastic phone. Standing at 104 x 55 x 12.8 mm Smart is no hassle to handle and carry around. At 108 g of weight it?s a stout little handset, almost matching the measurements of the smallish HTC Tattoo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of design, it?s really hard to call HTC Smart unique or innovative. There isn?t much room for designer imagination when making a touch-controlled device and that?s exactly the case with this Smart fella.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.8? QVGA resistive touchscreen is on the small side and its sunlight legibility is very poor. Unfortunately, that?s not all. The screen brightness is rather disappointing and despite it?s capable of displaying 256K colors, image quality is poor. There is prominent color banding in the Sense UI wallpapers and gallery, which doesn?t suit the fancy interface at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart is compact and solid and the rounded edges make for a friendlier look and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel does look like it could've accommodated a larger screen but the hardware buttons didn't leave much room for growth. Again, a 2.8" QVGA resistive touchscreen is nothing to write home about really, but it might have been the only choice in this price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Smart doesn?t have a stylus so the only upside is that you can operate the resistive screen with your gloves on. Resistive units don?t have the sensitivity of capacitive displays and require a stronger push to register the tap. Still HTC Sense UI is quite thumbable and you won?t miss the stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we only find the earpiece. The phone has no ambient light sensor or a dedicated camera for video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Four hardware keys share the space below the screen. A trio of the call keys and menu/back button takes almost the whole place, leaving a very small and inconvenient Option key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both receiver keys and the middle Menu/Back one are well defined and solid to press. The smallish Option key is quite unhandy and you?ve gotta use your fingernail. It opens lots of context menus and it would have been nice a better and user friendly design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a lonely volume rocker on the left side of the Smart, while the right side houses the camera shutter key. Both keys are plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the HTC Smart you can find the standard 3.5mm audio jack. There is no protective cover on the audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features the miniUSB port for connecting the data cable and the charger. Right next to it is the mouthpiece, while the far left corner is occupied by the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart back panel features the 3-megapixel fixed focus camera lens, the LED flash and the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover reveals the 1100 mAh Li-ion battery that powers the whole thing. The talk time of Smart is quoted at 7.5 hours, while standby sits at 450h. Unfortunately we couldn?t measure a realistic real-life battery performance due to our heavy reviewing routine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the stuff under the HTC Smart hood, next to the battery you'll also find the microSD card slot. It?s hot-swappable, but you?ll still need to remove the battery cover every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality is really impressive, we give it that. HTC Smart is quite comfortable to use too ? compact and pocket-friendly and we have no complains about the overall design.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Brew Mobile is in charge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Hero pioneered the Sense UI on Android handsets. Then it was adopted by the Windows Mobile OS, extending the previous TouchFLO 3D interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense is currently the most popular custom UI for smartphones andit?s probably the most successful. But it was quite a surprise when HTC announced the revival of the Brew platform, which will entirely rely on the cool Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let?s get a rundown of what makes Brew tick. Brew stands for Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless and it?s created by Qualcomm. Basically it?s an application development platform, which originally targeted the CDMA devices but today it already supports GSM as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brew is something like a proprietary mobile software with own SDK for developing apps. It?s not a real smartphone operating system, but more like upgraded feature phone software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Initially it was difficult to distribute Brew apps, but now Qualcomm created the Plaza Retail which is some kind of an application store. Unfortunately it?s strictly operator, region or device limited and HTC Smart is not supported at this moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum things up ? Brew Mobile Platform is a very basic OS, closer to feature phones rather to the smartphones, with some limited app support but only through custom carrier-specific AppStores. And we didn?t find any access to third party apps on our SIM-free retail HTC Smart test unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as user interface is concerned, we ve hardly seen what the regular BREW interface looks like. On the HTC Smart HTC has skinned everything with the Sense UI. This Smartie lives and breathes Sense.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Sense UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense UI revolves around Scenes, which are essentially three custom homescreen setups ? Work, Life style and Clean state. Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen - for instance, the Work scene has a stocks widget, while the Life style offers social widgets. The clean state has no widgets and it?s up to you to customize it. After you finish adding items you may save everything as a new custom scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the current scene by dragging your finger top down from any of the homescreens. Switching between scenes takes one-two seconds and is a handy customization approach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every single widget takes a whole homescreen ? just like with the Sense running on Windows Mobile devices. You can choose among ten availabe widgets (homescreens), but you can only have up to seven selected at the same time. People, Mail, Weather, Internet, Calendar, Music, Photos, Messages and Friend Stream plus the non-negotiable Home ? those are ten screens in total. Sounds familiar, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home one packs the typical HTC clock with three shortcuts and another six on a swipe away. This homescreen has context menu offering to customize the scenes, change the wallpaper, choose the other homescreens and a shortcut to settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People screen packs nine contact shortcuts associated with frequently used actions (call, text or email) and your choice will be visible on the contact?s thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail and Messages homescreens look and behave exactly as on the Android Sense ? they?re like widgets packing all your new and latest emails or SMS/MMS. If you tap on them, they open in the full-featured app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sense UI (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Weather and Calendar are the same as on the other platforms. The weather screen sacrificed the cool animations and the multiple city support though. You can still track several locations, but you need to open the Weather app itself ? just tap on the widget. The Calendar needs no explanations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos and Music homescreens are simple. You can?t shift through the stack of images here ? you can only open up the gallery when you tap on them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Music homescreen you can change tracks, but you can?t change the album without opening the full-featured music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Browser screen has one big shortcut to the standard web browser called OMIGO and a second one for its bookmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally comes the Friend Stream, which caters for social networking on the HTC Smart. It shows the latest status updates of your friends in Facebook and Twitter. To use this widget you must link your profile to Facebook/Twitter and have matching friends with your phone?s contacts. After this is done properly, their latest updates will start coming up here in the Friend Stream widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area that slides down like a blind is thing you may have seen on all Android smartphones. It shows any missed events or alerts. Instead of some connectivity shortcuts, you?ll find the Scenes toggles at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Smart main menu is rather simple ? it?s organized in pages with 3x3 grid of icons. Swiping away through the pages of icons is easy. The submenus are visualized as text-only lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That pretty much sums up the Smart?s interface. There is no task manager or task switcher.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple, but powerful phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, HTC have their own vision of what a good phonebook should look like and despite its simple looks, the Smart?s phonebook is a quite powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s most important feature is the tight social integration with Facebook and Twitter, which we enjoyed on lots of the latest HTC Androids. If you configured right your Facebook and Twitter accounts you may sync them with your Smart. That way you will have all your social buddies into your phonebook. Don?t worry, HTC Smart will still let you choose which contacts to import.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once imported, you will be able to track all the social activities of that person. If you already have that contact in your phone, it will merge with the Facebook/Twitter one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is pretty simple ? it shows all of your contacts and their pictures. There is kinetic scrolling and a search option into the context menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a contact reveals all of its details ? phones, emails, etc. Above them there are three counters ? messages, emails and call history. Tapping on each of them will open the relevant communication history log.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality in calls is quite good and the in-ear volume level is great ? you don?t have to set it on maximum to have a nice audible sound. Reception is trouble-free as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer shows a list of all your contacts and those get filtered automatically once you start dialing thanks to Smart Dialing. You can also hide the keypad and directly scroll through the contacts. Everything here copies the excellent user experience of the Windows Mobile dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart doesn?t have a proximity sensor, so the screen doesn?t turn off during a call. Still there are no on-screen buttons during calls eliminating the chance of making accidental presses with your cheek or ear. The mute and speaker functions are the only two in the context menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, voice dialing is a no-go on the HTC Smart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the HTC Smart scored n Excellent score. Here is how it stacks among some other handsets we?ve tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart supports sending and receiving SMS, MMS, and email messages. SMS and MMS share the same editor. Messages app offers only a conversation view grouping your messages by sender.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to email, setting yours on the HTC Smart is hassle-free. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you can tweak. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported and you can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset. The email client supports SSL encryption too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple accounts are also supported and you can switch among them any time. Unfortunately there is no shared inbox for all your email accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the overall look is pretty simple and quite different from the polished dedicated widgets on the homescreen. Still it doesn?t lack any critical functionality and the messaging department covers all basics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery is very basic - all images and clips are displayed all at once as small thumbs. When you select a file you can see it only in landscape mode. Swiping left or right shows you the next image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports double tap zooming but it?s quite slow. There is also an additional zoom bar that seems to appear only when you have zoomed in, that allows you to check the photo at pixel level and even beyond that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player does a good job. Tracks can be sorted by albums, artists, playlist or listed all at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart?s audio player offers a simplistic interface. After choosing a track, you get its album art (if available) and the music controls. There are also shortcuts for shuffle and repeat at the top bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no visualization or equalizer options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player in the HTC Smart main menu. Still you can watch video files from the gallery or the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The supported formats are MP4/3GP only and limited up to QVGA resolution. The interface is almost absent except the Play/Pause and Stretch buttons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Smart is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 6 stations as favorites. You can also listen on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Above average audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Smart is certainly one of the loudest handsets around and comes with a pretty clean audio output too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cut-off trebles are our only regret about the Smart audio output, the rest of the readings being pretty good. In fact the Noise level, Dynamic range and stereo crosstalk scores of the little fella are nothing short of impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Smart vs LG GT540 Optimus frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Boring camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart is equipped with a 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera for a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. There?s also a LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is quite basic with a camera/camcorder switch and a flash button. Hitting the "Menu" reveals six buttons on a bar at the bottom of the screen. The rightmost can lead you to an Advanced settings menu. There you can set some color effects, brightness and contrast of the photos, toggle digital zoom and go to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart produces camera images with generally poor image quality. The phone?s camera underexposes most shots producing dark images with undeveloped shadows. The amount of resolved detail isn?t that bad and the colors are close enough but the output is not really satisfactory. You can check it the original camera samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the HTC Smart. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart is capable of recording QVGA video with 15 fps, which isn't something to write home about. It still is better than nothing, but it?s hardly suited for anything more than MMS purposes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is almost identical to the still camera's. It sports a setting for picking between MP4 and 3GP (H.263) encoding, which theoretically should give you the choice between smaller file and a higher-quality video. In practice the low resolution makes sure that the differences between the two formats aren't really so obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mid-range connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Smart is usable worldwide with quad-band GSM support. It also packs 3G support at the 2100 band. With HSDPA it seems geared for speedy network data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is present and it is complete with A2DP support. The miniUSB port for syncing and data transfers is also on board along with a 3.5 mm audio jack for the audiophiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately Wi-Fi connectivity is not an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microSD slot onboard supporting cards up to 16GB. Unfortunately there is no card bundled with the Smart. When you connect it to a computer, the memory card is mounted as a Removable drive on the computer in Mass Storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recently HTC updated their HTC Sync software so it's now compatible with the Smart. This is your only option for synchronization with a computer so getting it from the official HTC website is highly recommended.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing Browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart features the latest OBIGO web browser, which is an in-house application. It?s only notable feature is the Java support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one way of zooming ? the double tap. Tapping twice on a block of text or an image and the handset will automatically zoom in to it. Another double tap and you are back to the previous zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the browser is mesquite poor. Its scrolling is OK, but the accuracy is terrible. If you want to follow some link, you will need to tap at least five times, before it recognizes your intention. Even more, the browser is very sluggish on loading and zooming, so you will need to be very patient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, the browser is disappointing. But thanks to the native Java MIDP 2.1 support, you are welcomed to install Opera Mini, which will save the day.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer is another department in the HTC Smart UI that offers less than expected. There are only three apps in that department ? the calendar, a calculator and the alarms. There is no way of jotting down a note or a memo, there is also no unit converter, office document viewer, not even a voice recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers monthly and daily view modes. You can set the starting date and time of an event and set an alarm to act as a reminder. There are no special kinds of events such as meeting, anniversary, etc. It?s just a unified one ? you can put subject, place, date and time, some notes and an alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an Agenda view summarizing all of your events in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator offers only the basic functions and there are no advanced or scientific options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm is quite customizable. You can set up to 4 alarms, each with the following configurable options - custom ringtone, volume, repetition days and name.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Few applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The application package is quite disappointing - weather and flashlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather app supports up to five cities and shows a five-day forecast. Its dedicated widget shows only one as we mentioned before and there are no animation eye-candies as on Android and Windows Mobile. Still, it?s a nice app and it?s much better than what we?ve seen on other feature phones for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Flashlight turns on/off the LED so you can use it as a torch. There are three different levels of the LED power.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Three games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are three pre-installed games ? Memory, Rings and Whac?Em.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three of them are quite simple ? Memory is about memorizing and then matching similar cards, in Rings you need to throw some rings into targets and in Whac?Em you need to eliminate some moles from a corn field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Java manager, where you can install and manage different Java applications. In fact that?s the only way to put some new apps on your Smart for now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart is the HTC?s first experiment of going beyond the Android and Windows Mobile realms. In fact it?s their closest attempt to producing a basic feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to other HTC handsets, the HTC Smart has got top-notch build quality. It uses some high-quality plastics and its smallish size makes it quite pocket-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, its software platform is what lets it down. The Brew platform is not the smartest of platforms out there, but perhaps with proper support and good developer base, it can be turned into something more than a regular feature phone interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense UI skin over Brew Mobile is probably the best part of HTC Smart. The homescreens are almost identical to those in Android and Windows Mobile both in looks and functionality. Still the eye-candy effects are sacrificed for performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Sense UI can hardly make up for the basic looks of the submenus that use plain text and black backgrounds similar to the dated BlackBerry OS. The poor QVGA display also lets down the Sense UI graphics and the lack of a good application package on board ruins the overall experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For instance, the default web browser is still in beta version, sluggish, often crashing and its loading speeds are quite slow. The organizer functionality ends with the calendar and alarm apps plus a simple calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC may call the Smart a smartphone but it has no multi-tasking, no application store and quite a poor choice of pre-installed apps. Combine that with the basic looks and capabilities of the whole platform and by our books, Smart barely makes it to a feature phone grade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently HTC Smart goes for around 200 euro. If it was supposed to be the first cheap and basic touchscreen handset by HTC, they most definitely messed up with ?cheap? there. Let?s see what else you can get in that price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The youthful HTC Tattoo teases with exchangeable and customizable panels, full-connectivity package (3G, Wi-Fi, GPS) and Android OS. It has almost the same size and price tag as Smart, but offers much more features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Tattoo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus is the other Droid with similar price, but with bigger and better display, lots of connectivity options including Wi-Fi and DivX/XviD playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG GT540 Optimus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is another smartphone that is already proven guilty of delivering impressively high value for its budget price. The Symbian-powered device is also full of both software and hardware goodies, not to mention Nokia are now throwing in free GPS navigation and free car stands with every new touch phone they sell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we find LG KM900 Arena and Samsung S8000 Jet resting at the feature phone camp. Both champs sport rich-connectivity options, nice camera features and capable touchscreens. S-Class and TouchWiz UIs are full of eye-candy, lots of software power and plenty of useful functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG KM900 Arena ? Samsung S8000 Jet</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Smart fails to defend its name. With no applications and lack of premium features plus the non-smart OS, Smart won?t be able to stand up against the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really hope HTC are going to launch its own applications store and offer proper OS support, otherwise this not-so-smart phone is going down fast. A decent price drop plus some software update will set the things right and we hope HTC?s already know that. Because as things stand today, HTC Smart is hardly the first choice, especially at a price point of 200 euro.</paragraph>
