			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung was clearly busy getting a bunch of gadgets ready for primetime at this year's IFA expo. The UNPACKED event delivered the long-rumored Samsung Galaxy Note 4, but the the cameo appearances were equally compelling. The Koreans managed to surprise everyone with a brand new Galaxy Edge, the Gear VR goggles were unveiled as well, and we saw the Gear S in action. Quite an eventful press conference indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 boasts a 5.7" QHD Super AMOLED screen, a Snapdragon 805 chipset, a 16MP OIS rear camera, metal framing, leather-like rear finish, new S-Pen features, among others. Sounds like an impressive upgrade but Samsung didn't stop there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has finally utilized the arched display we'd been catching rumors of for months. This is the highlight of the brand new Galaxy Note Edge. It has the same specs as the Note 4, but its display continues bending on the right side of the phone with additional 160px. This should make the Note Edge the smartphone with the highest resolution screen to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear VR kit, based on the Oculus technology, presents an entirely new way for you to use your smartphone. Just pair with your Note 4 (it's the only compatible device for now) and enter the VR world, armed with a touchpad, keys and sensors for making your way around. We'll get into the details shortly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we tried the Gear S smartwatch. It has exchangeable straps and clasps, works as an independent device, but can as well be paired with another Galaxy and become a helpful companion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung IFA presentation was a must-see but we hope it has only set the bar for others to beat. No more teasing though, let's get hands-on with the newcomers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4, one of the most anticipated smartphones lately, has finally became official in Berlin. It features a 5.7" Super AMOLED screen of QHD resolution (that's 515ppi), and runs on the latest Snapdragon 805 chipset with a quad-core 2.7GHz Krait 450 CPU, Adreno 420 GPU and 3GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Samsung will be offering another flavor of the Note 4 with its proprietary Exynos 5433 chipset, which packs an octa-core processor with four Cortex-A57 @ 1.9GHz and four Cortex-A53 @ 1.3GHz, Mali-T760 graphics and 3GB of RAM. The only other real difference between the two models is the Snapdragon-powered flavor offers LTE Cat.6 (300Mbps) connectivity, while the Exynos-based version stops at LTE Cat.4 (150Mbps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 incorporates the new design introduced by the Galaxy Alpha - a stylish metal chassis, high-quality rear plastic cover and protective screen glass with rounded Lumia-like edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new battery cover of the Galaxy Note 4 is very similar to the Note 3's, the faux-leather pattern is almost identical though the stitching is missing this time around. Even though the plastic is super thin, it fits perfectly on the back and feels as solid as possible. You can't tell what it is unless you open it. The Note 3 was made the same way, so no surprises here. And we like the new cover without the stitches better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the Galaxy Alpha, the Galaxy Note 4 features flared corners which improves handling a notch by preventing your fingers from slipping off the rounded corner. They also remind us a bit of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire front is covered by the latest generation Gorilla Glass 3. As we mentioned already, the glass ends on curved edges, really pleasant in both handling and working with the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the 5.7" QHD Super AMOLED display, the Note 4 has a pretty much familiar control set at the front. Above the screen we find the earpiece, a couple of sensors, plus the new 3.7MP selfie camera with f/1.9 aperture. The front camera has 90-degree viewing angles and is capable of 120-degree panoramic shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the Home button flanked by the capacitive Task Switcher and Back keys. The Home key integrates a fingerprint scanner, to lock/unlcok the phone and authorize transactions (it's PayPal-certified). It also enables Private mode, which gives you access to a secure part of the storage where you can keep sensitive data and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Note 4 feature a power/lock key on the right; volume rocker on the left; two mics, the S-Pen compartment and a microUSB 2.0 port at the bottom - the previous generation had USB 3.0. A 3.5mm audio jack, an extra mic and an IR blaster are lined up at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three microphones on the Note 4 for superior noise suppression. Samsung has created a new voice recording app too, which actively uses those three mics and will let you get rid of ambient noise or irrelevant voices in your recordings later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, Samsung has dropped the microUSB 3.0 port in favor of the old generation microUSB 2.0. Samsung didn't get into details about this decision, but you may consider it as a downgrade from the Galaxy Note 3. The good news is, Samsung has enabled fast charging, which speeds up the charging time by 30%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 4 battery is just 20mAh bigger than the Note 3's at 3220mAh. How the actual real life performance is affected is yet to be determined, especially considering the new hardware and higher-resolution display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pop the battery cover open you get access to the microSIM slot and the hot-swappable microSD card. You can insert up to 128GB memory card in there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 comes with a new camera at the back, too. It's a 16MP sensor, with optical image stabilization (finally!). It is accompanied by a single LED flash and is capable of 4K video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 4 also comes with a heart-rate monitor at the back and a tiny loudspeaker grille in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But what's a Note without an S-Pen? The new stylus looks a lot like the old one, but is slightly thinner and has fine ribs carved in the plastic for better handling, which is great. It has the same design as before, with a button positioned on one of those ribbed sides and is easy to reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new S-Pen offers a new functionality - you can use it as a mouse on your Note 4 - just drag it around and click with it. Samsung has managed to improve the S-Pen digitizer's pressure levels from 1024 up to 2048 and added some extra levels of thickness for the drawing pens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a new S-Pen widget that allows you to take notes straight on you homescreen - no need of clicking the Action key on your S-Pen. There is also a new Snap Note app that scans whatever you put in front of your camera and then reads all the text and pictures and extracts them. It works great at the venue, but we'll have to test it in more detail once we get our hands on a retail unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the Multi Window got an update too, it is now even more intuitive and there is a Multi Window shortcut straight in the Task Switcher interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 weighs a few grams more than the Note 3, but you'll hardly notice it. It looks better courtesy of the metal chassis, rounded screen glass and better rear cover. The handling is great, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 will launch in Frosted white, Charcoal black, Bronze Gold and Blossom Pink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've run the BaseMark OS II compound benchmark and both Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge came on the top of our chart. Both devices offer similar performance, but that's to be expected since they are basically identical.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note Edge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge was the surprise of the Samsung's UNPACKED event. Even though it was alluded to months ahead of IFA, it somehow managed to stay out of the rumor mill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, the Galaxy Note Edge hasn't got the three-sided screen in the end that some of the rumors suggested, but is still utilizing the same technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Specs-wise, the Galaxy Note Edge is absolutely identical to the Note 4, sans the screen and the battery capacity. Due to the bigger display, the battery had to be reduced down to 3,000mAh. Here is hoping the bigger display and lower capacity won't significantly reduce the battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge also features a metal chassis, just like the Galaxy Note 4, the plastic rear cover with faux leather pattern is also present. The Note Edge is running on the same Snapdragon 805 chipset and will come in an Exynos flavor, too. Finally, the 16MP OIS rear camera is the same as well, and so is the 3.7MP f/1.9 aperture front cam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key feature of the Galaxy Note Edge is the curved display. The 5.6" Super AMOLED screen of QHD resolution continues seamlessly into an extra 160 pixels to the right side. This means the entire display has a resolution of 1600 x 2560 pixels and density of 539ppi. This is probably the highest resolution display on a smartphone to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curved part of the display has various use cases. When locked, a swipe on this part of the screen will reveal the date, time and missed notifications. The main panel remains dark, only the additional 160px-wide strip will light up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you are on the lockscreen, you can use the additional strip for various purposes such as displaying stocks, weather, shortcuts (incl. flashlight), plus it can display a ruler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you unlock you Galaxy Note Edge, the extra screen space can be used for displaying Twitter feeds, additional docked shortcuts, stocks. Various apps will be able to utilize those extra pixels for various purposes - the video player for example has playback controls there, while you are watching a full-screen movie. Samsung will release an official SDK to the developers later, so third-party apps can use it as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Pen is the same as on the Note 4, with the same upgrades and compatible apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note Edge is obviously bigger than the Note 4, and the Note 3. It is definitely wider because of the bigger display, but is lighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note Edge will become available in Frosted white and Charcoal black, and will launch by the end of the year in select markets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Galaxy Note Edge camera samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've managed to download the official camera samples taken with the front camera of the Galaxy Note Edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And these are the some panoramic selfie samples, also taken with the front camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next are the 16MP images taken with the main camera of the Galaxy Note Edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here comes some HDR samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, these are samples taken with the so-called High Clear Zoom. We'll spare our comments about the quality for the retail unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Camera app is also capable of various cool shooting modes including high-res 360-degree panorama, Drama, Panning shot, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are two panoramic samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two Drama samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can check out these cool Panning shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Hands-on video. Here is a brief hands-on demo we've made for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Gear VR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gear VR is a Note 4 exclusive accessory based on Oculus Rift's hardware. Gear VR is meant to be a peripheral device that works with your phone. Your Note 4 is actually the screen on your Gear VR, as you need to put it in front of the goggle-like accessory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear VR has various controls including a touchpad, a back key, forward and backward keys. The Gear VR also incorporates an accelerometer, gyro and compass sensors. There is a proximity sensor as well, so the device will know when you remove it from your head and will pause automatically whatever you were playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear VR works only with the dedicated VR player in your Galaxy Note 4 and nothing else. The content is very limited for now, but we've played a 360-degree 3D video, and a game flying a plane and shooting with the side key. You need to move your head around all the time, but it's cool. There is no lag between moving your head and moving the picture, the latency is excellent indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the technology works great, even the Note 4 display isn't always sharp enough. The QHD resolution is halved for the 3D conversion and given that you will be looking at it from just a couple of centimeters away you can spot some pixelization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, you can look outside too, courtesy of the Note 4's camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear VR is made of plastic and is really light, there is even soft foam around the goggle-like front. The rear and top straps though are definitely hairstyle destroyers, so you should have that in mind too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've yet to see how cool the Gear VR will turn out as the Gear VR-enabled content starts appearing. For now you will enjoy the available demos, but that's it. And we doubt there will be many 360-degree movies in the upcoming months either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Gear VR will launch alongside the Galaxy Note 4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Gear S<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung officially announced the Gear S smartwatch with 3G connectivity a few days ago. The Tizen-based wearable will begin rolling out in markets around the globe starting October.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gear S features a 2" curved Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 480 x 360 pixels. The device is powered by a 1GHz dual-core CPU, coupled with 512MB of RAM. It also comes with a heart-rate monitor mounted on its rear. The smartwatch is IP67 certified for water and dust resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the device's specs include 4GB of built-in memory, full connectivity suite including quad-band 2G/3G, Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, GPS/GLONASS, and USB 2.0. The smartwatch is also capable of making and receiving phone calls through an optional Bluetooth neck accessory dubbed Samsung Gear Circle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The awesome thing about the Circle headset is it has magnets and you can stick the earbuds together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gear S looks stylish but we have to be honest - it is huge! Bigger than any other smartwatch we've seen so far, probably because of the additional phone modem and nanoSIM slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is Samsung is offering different straps you can choose from - there is one wide as the smartwatch itself, while you can opt for another more compact one. Samsung will be even offering different clasps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gear S runs on Tizen OS and is controlled by gestures. You get all notifications on the homescreen and tapping on each of them will take you to the appropriate app. Swiping left brings up the widgets, a swipe right pops up all notifications, a downwards swipe brings the shortcut area and an upwards swipe means system-wide Back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a home key on the Gear S. Tap once for the homescreen, tap twice for voice control. The voice interaction is really good and it is the easiest way around for text input. By the way, the Gear S offers an on-screen QWERTY keyboard, which is as optimized as possible, but two inches are just not enough for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing the Samsung Gear S lacks is a proper web browser. Samsung says it is working on such an app and hopefully it will become available for download eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Gear S can be used both as a main device and as a companion one. If need be, it can temporarily replace a smartphone if you don't want to carry one around. Samsung expects most people to use its SIM card for call forwarding from their main device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has announced it has already partnered with carriers for creating specific plans for the Gear S. Since it won't be used as a main device, the manufacturer wants to be sure the Gear S uses won't have to pay the expensive regular plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>THe Samsung Gear S and Samsung Gear Circle will launch in October, alongside the Galaxy Note 4 and the Gear VR.</paragraph>
