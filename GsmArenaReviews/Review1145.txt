			<paragraph>Buckle up people, because this is going to get rough. When the world's four most powerful smartphones are about to go ballistic, it is the right time to take this website's name literally. The stage is set for the four titans of the Android world: the Samsung Galaxy S III, the HTC One X, the Meizu MX 4-core and the LG Optimus 4X HD. The four horsemen of the apocalypse to anyone unfortunate enough to be their competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen and tested them all, and even had two of them in a thrilling head to head. This time around though, we have the full set. For an even more exciting twist, there's a cocky upstart against the Android establishment. And they're all after the ultimate prize.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With great power comes great responsibility and these phones not only represent themselves and their manufacturers. It's a battle of the chipsets too. Inside the Samsung Galaxy S III and Meizu MX Quad Core beats the same Exynos 4212 Quad chipset, while the HTC One X and the LG Optimus 4X HD are powered by the Nvidia Tegra 3 with not four, but five cores (an extra underclocked, power-saving core).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, in the end this not only an individual challenge but in a way a team competition as well. And there is room for only one winner. Here's what we'll be throwing at the quad-core contenders in this epic shootout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll begin with a general overview of the user interface of each of the smartphones to get a sense of their personality. And that's just a mild warm-up before a series of benchmarks and stress tests. This isn't just about what the two different chipset architectures are capable of, but also whether these droids make the most of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll be testing processors, graphics and web browsers, in search of the ultimate Android phone of the season. Stills and Full-HD video are also on the list. With an all-in mentality, these smartphones are great cameraphones too. So, we'll be looking at how they perform and, ultimately, which one gets on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anything else? Sure. Some display and battery scores will be thrown in the mix to see how those handle everyday smartphone tasks. Processing power is important, but don't tell the whole story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, there we are. Four great phones and only one goal - outrun and outsmart. Money is no object here. We are dealt with a four-of-a-kind and we're going to play it. Let the tests begin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 12 September: We updated the HTC One X and the LG Optimus 4X HD to Android 4.0.4 and redid all the tests. Find the new benchmark results on pages 6 and 7. The new video samples from the LG smartphone are on page 9.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Screen comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though this article is centered around the premise of comparing phones with quad-core processors, the screen is almost as important - what would be the use of all that computing power if the screen is going to limit what you can do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Three phones seem to have roughly similar screens (4.7"-4.8" big, 720p resolution) and it's only the Meizu MX 4-core that stands out with its more compact, lower-res screen. We'll summarize the various specs of each screen in a table and try to hash things out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The table covers the basics - size, resolution, pixel density and so on - plus "bezel". Bezel is our attempt to estimate how much the bezel around the screen takes up - the less bezel, the smaller phone for the screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between 4.7" and 4.8" isn't that big - it only offers around 4% more viewing area and it only leads to a minimal drop in pixel density. The three big screened phones all have 300+ ppi pixel density (qualifying them for the unofficial "Retina" label), but the Meizu MX 4-core is a bit below that mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in sharpness is only there if you look really closely, though. If you keep the smartphones a few inches away from your face, you might see some jagginess on the MX 4-core screen, but it's not something you'll notice in daily operation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III uses a Super AMOLED screen with a PenTile matrix, so it only has two thirds of the subpixels of the other two 720p screens. So, even though it technically has a high pixel density, jagginess and a cross-hatch pattern might appear, but again you'd need to be looking from way closer than what permits comfortable usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu does lose points for its iPhonish 3:2 aspect ratio - it fits neither 4:3 photos nor 16:9 videos without letterboxing, making the usable area of the already small (relatively speaking) screen even tinier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our bezel measurement isn't perfectly accurate (the shape of the phones is rounded and we estimated the area using rectangles), but it shows what you can probably see from photos of the four phones - there's a lot of bezel above and below the Meizu's screen, while the LG wastes only a minimal area on its front for bezel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for protection, the big-screen phones rely on Corning's Gorilla Glass, while the Meizu lacks toughened glass to guard its display. The Galaxy S III stands out here with Gorilla Glass 2, which Corning describes as 20% thinner but just as tough as the first version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far so good, but these specs don't tell us much about how the screens look. For example, the Galaxy S III has a Super AMOLED screen with excellent black levels, but the LCDs on the other three are brighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the table that summarizes our results from tests we've performed on the screens.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast (sunlight)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III (expectedly) impresses with perfect blacks and contrast, but it's the contrast in bright sunlight that stands out the most - even though it's not very bright, the reflectivity of the screen is very low and offers much better sunlight legibility than the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X can't match the dark blacks of the S III, but its contrast is still very good - some of the best we've seen from LCDs (though not the best),. Sunlight legibility is above average, but not as good as on the Super AMOLED either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD's screen has the distinction of being the brightest of the bunch - while it's not the brightest LCD we've seen (even from LG themselves), 750 nits are plenty. Sadly, that couldn't help its sunlight legibility too much, but if there's no direct sunlight hitting the screen, the 4X HD screen offers pretty image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX 4-core has a screen that has the worst black levels of the four, while offering not much more brightness than the dimmest LCD here (the One X screen). As a result, the contrast isn't good even under ideal conditions and it only gets worse under sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a bit more that can't be put in a table. The Meizu MX 4-core screen has noticeable contrast degradation when you look at it at an angle, plus there's some color shifting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the LG Optimus 4X HD maintains its contrast regardless of viewing angle, although the colors shift when you view it in certain angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X has neither of those issues, plus it has that desirable laminated feel where the image appear as if painted on the surface of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III doesn't suffer from contrast degradation, but there is some bluish tint appearing at an angle (typical for AMOLEDs). It also has the makings of the laminated look, but the One X does it better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end we have to split things into two groups. Some love the deep blacks and vibrant colors that AMOLED screen enjoy, so the Galaxy S III would be perfect for them. And let's not forget its excellent sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Members of the other camp are not willing to sacrifice brightness and subpixel count, so they stick with LCDs - they'll love the HTC One X. It offers excellent contrast and viewing angles, the coveted laminated look and pretty decent sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X isn't far behind either - offering the same level of sharpness and even higher brightness, its True HD-IPS LCD is quite nice to look at. Not to mention that it's mounted on the most compact body of the three larger screens, which is an achievement on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we had to criticize a screen, it would be the one on the Meizu MX 4-core - it's not properly protected, has a aspect ratio that's not ideal for neither photo nor video watching and the viewing experience just can't match that of the other three. It's not a bad screen at all, but it's not exactly flagship material.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the biggest worries that people have about quad-core processors is that they are power-hungry. NVIDIA even went as far as adding a fifth CPU core - a so-called power-saving core - to improve battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manufacturers have also tried shoving large batteries inside the phones. With the extra room from the large screens, they've had some success - the LG Optimus 4X HD and the Samsung Galaxy S III have 2150mAh and 2100mAh batteries respectively. The HTC One X has "only" 1800mAh in its battery, despite its size, and the Meizu MX 4-core comes very close to it despite more compact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery capacity (mAh)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you haven't read them, we have blog posts with detail on the battery life on each phone individually (you can find the links at the bottom of each phone's specs table). Here we'll concentrate on comparing the battery performance of the four phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the final reading - our endurance rating. It measures how long a phone can last given a predefined usage pattern. We use an hour of talk time on a 3G network, an hour of web browsing over Wi-Fi and an hour of watching an SD video every 24 hours.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Endurance rating<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III scores the highest here with 43 hours - if your usage isn't heavier than our test usage, it will get you through almost two full days before you need to hook it up to a charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other phone with a large battery - the LG Optimus 4X HD - comes in second with a 40 hour score. Depending on how late you come back home on the second, it might too get you through two days of usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X and Meizu MX 4-core and their smaller batteries last around 37-38 hours of usage, which is closer to a day and a half.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at how the phones handle each individual task. The LG Optimus 4X HD runs out of juice in under 8 hours of talk time, while you can get about 10 hours of the other three.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus and the HTC One X show an unimpressive web browsing time of about 4 hours before their batteries run flat - surprisingly the Galaxy S III beats them by an hour (phones with AMOLED screens typically don't do too well when faced with the predominantly white web pages in our our web browsing test) as does the Meizu MX 4-core (though the smaller screen on this one surely helps).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III takes the video watching championship by a huge margin - more than double of what the worst performer of the four phones (the Optimus 4X HD) achieved.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III offers the best battery life of the four and people who spend a lot of time watching videos on their phone will really feel the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next comes the LG Optimus 4X HD - it scored the lowest in the three categories (talk time, browsing and videos) and it's only that power-saving fifth core, enables efficient standby, that helps it save face. It good a good overall score, but given that it has the biggest battery we really expected it to do even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A part of the explanation is that the LG Optimus 4X screen is much brighter when set to 50% than its three competitors, which means that it needs more power to work. However, it's not just that as repeating the tests at automatic brightness returned quite similar results and the screen doesn't even work during the talk time test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD and the Samsung Galaxy S III also deserve extra points for allowing you to replace their batteries and giving you the option to carry a spare one when you need extra endurance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX 4-core would be our third pick - it can't match the S III when it comes to watching videos, but it does match it in the other two categories. Its inefficient standby costs it a few hours off the endurance rating, though. It will probably do better than the Optimus 4X HD when used more heavily, but its non-replaceable battery relegated it to third place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X will let you talk for a long time, but when it comes to browsing the web or watching videos it's only average. Shame that HTC didn't fit a bigger battery (it's non-replaceable too).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung, HTC, LG and Meizu have left the world of vanilla Android behind them and gone for a customized interface with Ice Cream Sandwich left hiding underneath. Nothing is left to chance here, and all manufacturers have stuffed the stock Android OS with as many features as they could before the launch dates of their devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is often the case with Android, version 4.1 Jelly Bean got announced a couple of months after the flagships came to market. However, given their positions as the kings of their respective lineups, it's not really a question of if these flagships will get the Jelly Bean update, but when.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, even without Jelly Bean and its Project Butter, Android performs outstandingly on all four devices. No surprise here, considering all the horsepower being thrown around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Sense UI is still the most eye-catching and great to look, while TouchWiz on the Galaxy S III packs more features than the International Space Station. It's really a Swiss army knife with a touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Sense UI is able to match TouchWiz in key features supported. For example, both have the Apt-X audio codec for high-quality stereo sound over Bluetooth, burst shot camera modes, HDR and the ability to simultaneously take photos while shooting video. Both even sport wireless HDMI connectivity (Samsung AllShare Cast &amp; HTC Media Link HD).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we can't really ignore the TouchWiz features that go the extra mile, such as S Voice (competitor to Apple's Siri), S Beam (NFC-based media sharing), Pop-up play and Buddy photo share. And while those aren't living up to their full potential yet, features like Smart Stay and Direct call put TouchWiz in a league of its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on we to the Optimus 4X HD we find that LG has also done a great job with their Optimus UI 3.0. The Koreans have eased off on the customizations and gone for more subtle yet useful changes to Android. More often than on any of its competitors, you'll see design elements from vanilla Ice Cream Sandwich and that's not a bad thing in our book.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And despite the few UI changes, there are some nice little touches that make this another great UI skin and give you an enjoyable experience. There are also a ton of nifty shortcuts, which are a real time saver once you get the hang of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the Meizu MX 4-core takes a different approach to Android altogether. It's running Flyme OS 1.0.1, which is based on Ice Cream Sandwich but doesn't look anything like Android. In fact, its designed and navigation is rather reminiscent of Apple's iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At a first glance, the Flyme OS is nothing more than a flat interface with a bunch of home screens populated with icons. There's no app drawer or shortcuts, and all application icons are put on the home screens, iPhone style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you can easily replace Samsung's TouchWiz, HTC's Sense and LG's Optimus UI with any custom launcher, that's not the case with Meizu's Flyme. It's so deeply baked into Android that it takes some deep tinkering to achieve any form of outside customization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the up side, Meizu has cooked up a pretty elaborate lock screen, and an excellent task manager and notification center. Seasoned Android users will need a minute to familiarize themselves with the odd interface, but once you get used to it, it's a breeze to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, Flyme OS is the least functional of all the involved launchers. The flat UI limits your customization options, there are way fewer widgets and even some of the native Android features had to be axed. However if you are looking to get an iOS-like experience combined with (most of) the freedom provided by Android, it seems like a great choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end picking up the best UI is strictly a matter of personal preference. There are differences of course, but it's up to you to decide which one suits your usage patterns best. What's important here is that all of them run extremely well on their respective smartphones and won't ever invoke memory of the old, laggy Android days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, let's jump straight in to what you all came to see - performance comparisons between Samsung's Exynos Quad and Nvidia's Tegra 3 chipsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual, we've tested how the loudspeakers on each of the phones perform. Three score Good marks with the HTC One X scoring Average, but really it's just under the threshold for getting the same rating as its peers. The Galaxy S III and LG Optimus 4X HD are slightly louder than the other two.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Two the four contenders fared excellently in the first part of our audio quality test. The Samsung Galaxy S III, and the Meizu MX 4-core produced excellent scores all over the field and you can be sure that they can suply perfectly clean sound to your home or car stereo. The Meizu MX 4-core clinches the top spot on this occassion due to its higher volume levels with the Galaxy S III sliding right below it in the ranking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X and LG Optimus 4X HD performance with no headphones attached was pretty mediocre and not suited to their high-end status. The HTC finishes a distant third due to its lower (but still rather poo) distortion levels and slightly higher volume. As for the Optimus 4X HD - we've seen $100 smartphones do better than it and that's as damning a verdict as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a pair of headphones to the mix alters the picture and the Galaxy S III comes out on top. The Meizu MX 4-core doesn't produce as clean results, but it again offers higher volume levels, which makes it a close second. Once again the two Tegra 3-packing devices dissapointed, with the HTC One X still managing to do a little better than the LG Optimus 4XHD.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update, September 12: We updated the HTC One X to the latest available firmware version (based on Android 4.0.4) and re-ran the benchmarks. The text for the whole synthetic benchmarks chapter has been updated to reflect this - the One X saw a major performance increase after the update, in the three key areas (CPU, GPU, web browser).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD was also updated to the latest available firmware version, but its benchmark scores did not change.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More cores, more power the mantra goes - and with four CPU cores, these are the most powerful phones on the market right now. Things should be pretty close though - we're actually comparing only two different chipsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III and the Meizu MX 4-core both use a quad-core Exynos chipsets with their processors clocked at 1.4GHz. The HTC One X and the LG Optimus 4X HD use NVIDIA's Tegra 3 - their four CPU cores are going a bit faster at 1.5GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of cores, they are all Cortex-A9 cores, so they should be on pretty equal footing (except for a small clock advantage for the Tegra 3 camp). The GPUs are different though - Exynos uses Mali-400MP, while Tegra relies on NVIDIA's own mobile GeForce GPU. We should also note that the Meizu MX 4-core screen has a 640 x 960, while the other three have 720p screens (50% more pixels to push).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then there's plenty that comes down to software - we've seen phones with identical chipsets perform quite differently. We tried as much as possible to put all the phones on equal-footing - they all run the latest Android 4.0 ICS skinned by their respective manufacturers and we're using Chrome for the browser tests (as it's available on all devices and gives faster than the stock browser and probably the future of browsing on Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> CPU benchmarks</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start off with the processor benchmarking. The Meizu MX 4-Core emerges as the leader here, with the highest Linpack result, highest overall and CPU scores in AnTuTu, though it posted the slowest time in Benchmark Pi and Quadrant score wasn't impressive (though this benchmark tests more than the CPU).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The margins are pretty thin, but the HTC One X comes in second after the update - it won the Benchmark Pi race, aced Quadrant and AnTuTu's RAM test. Performance in Linpack got quite close to the Exynos-packing phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD and the Galaxy S III seem closely matched - they posted pretty much the same time in Benchmark Pi, but the Galaxy S III has a wide lead in Linpack, while the Optimus 4X gets better CPU and RAM scores in AnTuTu. Quadrant would give the victory to Galaxy S III, but only by a small margin.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>GPU benchmarks</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mali-400MP GPU used in the Exynos chipset has proven itself quite capable and it can add another victory to its name - the Samsung Galaxy S III conquers three out of the four tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It outperformed its GeForce-powered rivals by a wide margin and even managed to beat the Meizu MX 4-core in NenaMark 2, despite the shared chipset and the pixel count disadvantage (NenaMark is rendered at native resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark 2.1 levels the playing field (that means that the graphics are rendered at 720p resolution, regardless of the real screen resolution) and gives the Meizu MX 4-core a solid second place, though AnTuTu puts it last.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the HTC One X, which beats the MX 4-core in NenaMark (again, despite the resolution disadvantage) and comes in first place in AnTuTu. GLBenchmark 2.1 scores remained virtually unchanged after the update and put the One X in third place - behind the MX 4-core by a pretty wide margin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other Tegra 3-powered phone, the LG Optimus 4X HD, is consistently coming last, with only AnTuTu putting it in third position. Considering it's working with the same chipset and screen resolution, HTC has done the better job of optimizing their software.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Web browsing benchmarks</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to web browsing, the Samsung Galaxy S III has it. It came out first in SunSpider and BrowserMark, was the only phone that distinguished itself in HTML5Test (the other three posted identical results). The Galaxy S III was the slowest in FishIE Tank but not by much compared to the other 720p phones and not far behind the lower-res Meizu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX 4-core comes in second with SunSpider and BrowserMark results practically identical to those of the S III, the fastest FishIE Tank result (again, the lower resolution helps), but it also got the lowest Vellamo score. And (while not strictly a performance benchmark), the smaller screen also affects the browsing experience from the MX 4-core.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pre-update HTC One X wasn't very impressive, but after it got to Andoroid 4.0.4, its performance came good enough for third place. It closed the gap in SunSpider and BrowserMark and came first place in Vellamo. It was also the fastest of the 720p phones in FishIE Tank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD is close behind with a slightly better BrowserMark result than the One X and very similar SunSpider and FishIE Tank scores, but it's behind by quite a bit in Vellamo.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Summary</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III leaves something to be desired in terms of CPU performance - it has more power than almost any other smartphone on the market, but it has to blush when it admits the Meizu MX 4-core beat it using its own chipset. However, it scored pretty definitive wins in 3D gaming and web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX 4-core shows that the newcomer can certainly play - and often beat - the big boys. It wasn't the fastest overall, but the Meizu team mush feel good for beating established competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X showed serious skill in the CPU benchmarks and very good performance in the web browser tests. The NVIDIA GPU may not have scored too well in GLBenchmark, but the One X still beat the Optimus there and showed good scores in NenaMark 2 and AnTuTu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD comes closet the Galaxy S III in CPU performance, but software keeps it down when it comes to GPU scores. It's pretty competitive against the One X in browsing, even here it doesn't have much of an advantage.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On paper, the cameras on all four phones are identical - 8MP stills, 1080p video, a single-LED flash and no shutter key. If you dig a little deeper though, you'll start noticing differences. Stuff like burst shot, taking photos while recording video and so on might not be essential to your photography needs, but they could come in handy at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a table that shows what each of the contenders has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've covered these features in each smartphone's review, so we'll just go over them quickly. Here it's more important to note the differences between the implementations of the same feature on the four phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus lets you refocus a shot on a particular object. All besides the Optimus 4X HD let you do that even while recording video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD and the Meizu MX 4-core try to make up for the lack of a hardware shutter key by letting you use the volume rocker instead, but the rockers aren't all that comfortable and they can't be half-pressed for activating auto-focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Burst mode shoots several photos in quick succession - the Meizu MX 4-core always snaps 5, while the others continue shooting while you have the shutter key pressed. The Samsung Galaxy S III is limited to a maximum of 20 to prevent you from accidentally filling up the memory with identical shots. An option in burst shot mode is Best photo, which snaps 8 photos and picks the best one automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X also imposes a 20 shots max by default, but you can remove that restriction. The LG Optimus 4X HD takes about a second between each shot, while the other three manage multiple shots per second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Group shot is unique to the HTC One X - it snaps 5 photos and for each face in the shot lets you pick which photo should be used, making it easy to adjust things so that everyone is smiling and nobody is blinking. We've seen a dedicated Scalado app do that as well as Huawei Ascend P1's native camera, but the other three phones in this comparison can't do it out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already covered Best photo, but the Samsung Galaxy S III also offers Buddy photo share - it recognizes your friends' faces and automatically tags them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD boasts a time-bending feature called Time catch shot - it actually takes photos before you press the shutter key, so when you do press it, you can pick from 5 shots taken around the time of pressing the key. This increases your chances of catching just the right moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature of the 4X HD is real-time video effects - it can either morph people's faces in funny ways or do a sort of poor man's green screen effect and replace the background with something more interesting (e.g. space).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX 4-core doesn't have HDR mode, it relies on Wide Dynamic Mode instead, which snaps only a single photo and isn't a match for HDR (which combines information from multiple shots). The Gesture shot lets you snap a photo by waving your hand in front of the proximity sensor - this way you can completely eliminate camera shake created by pressing the shutter key (yes, even the virtual one on the screen can cause some shake).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Each camera has a few flashy features to offer, but none of that will mater if they can't pass muster in terms of image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped four photos with each phone in the same lighting conditions (you can view the full resolution shots below) and we've prepared two 100% crops from two of these photos to highlight the difference in image quality. We'll also take a look at what our Photo Quality Comparison tool shows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the first crop. The Samsung Galaxy S III produces the sharpest photos of the four phones. Colors are mostly accurate though the greens are a bit off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X is behind in terms of sharpness, despite the overly aggressive sharpening. The contrast is set too high and colors off. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD comes pretty close to the Galaxy S III - the aggressive noise reduction has eradicated quite some detail in the foliage, but the colors are probably the best in its shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX 4-core produces photos with low-contrast, making them look washed out (the under-saturated colors don't help). The shadows are well-developed and the sharpness of the photos is pretty close to the One X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the next crop, the Galaxy S III still has some lead in terms of sharpness, but the Optimus 4X HD and Meizu MX 4-core come pretty close. It's only the HTC One X that is noticeably lagging behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung flagship is off when it comes to colors though - the yellow doesn't look right, possibly due to S III's tendency to boost the green channel. The MX 4-core is off too, but that's due to the yellowish color balance it had selected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again the colors on the Optimus 4X HD photo look the best here, with the One X colors being in the right neighborhood (but oversaturated as usual).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a comparison of the field of view captured by each camera. The HTC One X has the widest viewing angle, with the Meizu MX 4-core and the Samsung Galaxy S III snapping only a little less. The LG Optimus 4X has a noticeably narrower field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking to our Photo Quality Compare tool, it shows that the Samsung Galaxy S III offers the best horizontal and vertical resolution of the four, with the LG Optimus 4X HD coming breathing down its neck. The HTC One X lags behind despite the fact that the nature of the charts benefits the heavy sharpening in its processing and the Meizu MX 4-core produces soft photos with horizontal and vertical lines starting to blend pretty early.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S III vs. HTC One X (with iPhone 4S used as control)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Optimus 4X HD vs. Meizu MX 4-core (with iPhone 4S used as control)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next chart shows low levels for the Galaxy S III with the Optimus 4X HD coming close again (but there are hints of color noise in its photos). The noise reduction algorithm is more aggressive on the LG and the lines between the color squares are not as clearly defined as on the Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A good deal of sharpened noise is visible in the HTC One X photos, while the Meizu photos have fairly low amounts of noise and the noise reduction doesn't take too much away from the grass and gravel patches (unlike the HTC).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the third chart shows good white balance under artificial lighting from the Samsung Galaxy S III and the HTC One X, while photos from the LG Optimus 4X HD have a noticeable blue tint. The worst offender in this regard though is the Meizu MX 4-core with a heavy blue tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the HTC One X eked out more detail than the Optimus 4X HD and even the Galaxy S III, two phones that bested it thus far. Color issues aside, the Meizu MX 4-core holds its own against the 4X HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we'd call the Samsung Galaxy S III the winner here, with a slight advantage over the LG Optimus 4X HD. The HTC One X overprocesses shots and we found the results lacking, though it does have the widest FoV and it performs well under unfavorable lighting thanks to that bright F/2.0 aperture. The Meizu MX 4-core has potential but the software needs more tweaking and our unit had a lens issue.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We shot 1080p video samples with the four phones one after the other to ensure the lighting conditions are the same. We'll also have a look at what the Video Quality Compare tool has to show us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III videos came out a bit overexposed (which lead to some loss of detail). There's still have a fair amount left, they were the only ones with some detail left in the dark shadow under the bush, colors are accurate (but a bit washed out due to the exposure) and they look pretty unprocessed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X the LG Optimus 4X HD on the other hand push the contrast and saturation up quite a bit. The One X is no where close when it comes to the red umbrellas, while the 4X HD offers more accurate colors but pretty heavy sharpening too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX 4-core captured pretty good detail, but there's a yellow tint (same as in the still photos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking beyond the quality of static frames from the videos, we have to point out a few things that become noticeable when you watch the videos play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD constantly hunts for focus, making most (if not all) of its videos unusable as the image is out of focus every three seconds and there's no way to disable that feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, August 8: We updated the LG Optimus 4X HD with a new software and re-focusing is much less common now. It's actually on the verge of being slow to act as it takes a couple of seconds after a major change in the scene. Regardless, this update really improves the video camera performance on the 4X HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then comes the HTC One X, which shoots videos at 24fps (unlike the other three which hit 30fps). Its videos are choppier than the others due to the lower framerate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX 4-core offered a pretty narrow field of view, meaning you'll have to take a step back if you want to fit everything in the frame (that would otherwise fit with the other three).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an illustration that shows the difference in FoV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Once again has the widest field of view. With the LG Optimus 4X HD and the Samsung Galaxy S III come between it and the Meizu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung Galaxy S III went a bit over the top with the exposure, so you might need to manually tone it down if you're shooting video on a bright sunny day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can watch the video samples from the four phones on YouTube. Don't forget to pick 1080p and view the videos in fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the Video Compare tool, the Samsung Galaxy S III comes out on top in terms of detail captured. The Meizu MX 4-core edges out the other two competitors and comes in second, even though there are some noticeable compression artifacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X video has detail in one area of the frame but is soft in another area. Some compression artifacts are visible. The same goes for the LG Optimus 4X HD - the bitrate isn't quite enough. The frame is evenly sharp, but there's noticeable oversharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S III vs. HTC One X (with iPhone 4S used as control)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Optimus 4X HD vs. Meizu MX 4-core (with iPhone 4S used as control)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, it's the Samsung Galaxy S III that comes out on top - it's not perfect, but it's the best of the four. The HTC One X keeps plenty of detail, considering it has the widest FoV, but its videos are slightly choppy and it botches the color rendering. It did make up quite some ground in low-light shooting though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX 4-core again shows potential, but the narrow FoV and washed out colors work against it. As for the LG Optimus 4X HD, it's much easier to get a usable video out of it after the update, but videos still look over-processed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III, the HTC One X and the LG Optimus 4X HD are the best that the established Android manufacturers currently have to offer. Alongside them we saw the outsider (but a flagship in its own right), the Meizu MX 4-core. We compiled and analyzed a lot of data to compare the four powerhouse smartphones and now it's time to summarize our findings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III ? HTC One X ? LG Optimus 4X HD P880 ? Meizu MX 4-core</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S III showed strength in a lot of areas - screen, camera, battery life, GPU performance. It's also the one with the coolest software tricks to offer and even if TouchWiz isn't yet the looker that Sense is, it's far better in its latest iteration that it ever was before. Some people would object to its looks or its PenTile screen, but none of those is actually too big an isse and the Galaxy S III remains arguably the best smartphone on the market. Unfortunately, it's also the most expensive of the four, so making a pick isn't as straightforward as it might have seemed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's makes it even harder is that each of the Galaxy S III competitors is an impressive smartphone on its own. Take the HTC One X with its excellent screen and a beautiful build, for example. Its still camera wasn't the best, but the video camera did quite well. and even though the overall performance and battery life did not impress, you still get a lot of smartphone for its price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD 's weapons are a good screen packed in a compact body and very good still camera. It's also a bit cheaper than the One X and has a microSD card slot and removable battery. On the other hand the video camera is problematic and the performance isn't the best you can find in this group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the dark horse Meizu MX 4-core might end up successfully challenging the established players. It offers top-notch performance, good battery life and an experience unlike any of the other three smartphones involved in the shootout. There are areas in which the new comer was found lacking, though - the screen, the phone's build and a camera that leaves something to be desired.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finding one in a store near you might be a problem, as well, if you live outside of China (where it's the cheapest quad-core hands-down). Elsewhere though, it's priced around the same as a One X or Optimus 4X right now, so it doesn't have the price advantage as you would expect from a relatively unknown brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, there are other considerations about these smartphones that have to be taken into account - your personal preferences on looks, which features are most important to you and the deals you can get by your local carriers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's important here is that no matter which of the quad-core monsters you choose, you won't end up regretting your decision. These are not only the four best droids currently in existence, but also arguably the four best smartphones that money can currently buy. We don't think there has ever been a better time to be an Android fan.</paragraph>
