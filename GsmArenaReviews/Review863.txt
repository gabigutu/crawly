			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Mobile World Congress is a busy place teeming with gadgets from nearly every maker under the sun. We pay due attention to the big players, but on these pages you will find everything else. We make sure to cover everything - you never know when you might find an oyster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This article will perhaps be the slowest to grow - the MWC spans several days and we stumble on something new almost each day. We'll update it as new info comes in, here's what we have so far:</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid E3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid E3 feels pleasantly thin and the build quality impressed us. This up and coming gadget certainly has a few interesting tricks up its sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's start with the basics. The E3 has a 4.7" IPS LCD screen of 720p resolution, which gives it a pixel density of 312ppi, the norm in this segment. What the raw specs don't tell is just how good the image quality of the screen is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, you'll notice the standard 2MP front-facing video camera and an LED flash on the opposite side of the Acer logo. That's right, there's a dedicated flash for selfies. Another interesting feature here are the two speaker grilles - the E3 has a single speaker, the grille on top is a "design accent."</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back we see the main camera - a 13MP shooter - with its LED flash. Below it is a button that can be long pressed to launch the camera and then tapped again to take a photo (another feature to make selfies easier). A short press on the button outside the camera can be programmed to launch any app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid E3 is powered by a quad-core chipset (CPU at 1.2GHz) with 1GB of RAM. While it runs a relatively old Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, the interface moves surprisingly fast. Acer has promised a 4.4 KitKat update for the first half of this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has 4GB of built-in storage, but there's a microSD card slot. On the other side of the phone are two microSIM card slots - the E3 we handled is a dual-SIM device. There will be a single-SIM version too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid E3 will carry a ?200 price tag when it launches in April.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Z4 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Z4 is an entry-level phone with a 4" WVGA screen and a dual-core 1.3GHz processor. Flip covers are available for the Z4, an accessory typically reserved for higher-end devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While this one does not have a front-facing flash, it has the same button on the back that serves as a handy camera shortcut (long press to launch, short press to take photo). You can program this one to launch other apps too. The camera itself is not nearly as impressive as the E3's shooter, the Liquid Z4 does 5MP at most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the E3, the Liquid Z4 does not have stereo speakers but DTS tech should ensure quality audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Z4 will cost half as much as the E3, just ?100, when it comes out in April.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Grand Memo II LTE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Grand Memo II LTE is ZTE's new 6" phablet that has a 720p screen and manages a couple of Note-like features even without a stylus. More on that in a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Grand Memo II LTE comes in a thin plastic body with flat sides, slim bezels and a textured rear that features a 13MP camera and single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Grand Memo II LTE is entirely made of plastic but feels sturdy and premium nonetheless. The back has a textured matte finish, which enhances the grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MiFavor 2.3 UI offers SmartShare and miniview. Upon a press and hold on the back button you'll prompt SmartShare, which splits the screen in two to drag apps for multitasking into each half, while miniview scales the UI down for comfortable single-handed operation. Both features are practically copied from Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Grand Memo II LTE is big and hard to handle with one hand despite the software trickery used by ZTE - the sheer width of the phone is overwhelming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Grand Memo II LTE will launch in China this April and will later on become available throughout Europe, Asia Pacific and North America.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Grand Memo II LTE camera samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We snapped several photos with the 13MP camera samples with the Grand Memo II LTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet also record 1080p video:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HP Slate6 Voicetab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HP Slate6 Voicetab and The HP Slate7 Voicetab were both recently announced, but it's the first time we see them live.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HP Voicetab 6 is HP's first phablet. It's got a 6-inch 720p IPS display. The screen has really good viewing angles but only average contrast ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet feels amazingly light but we are not quite sure about the build quality. We can hear stuff moving inside when we flip and tilt it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HP Voicetab 6 runs stock Android UI, HP has not developed a UI of their own. We are not quite sure however what that means in terms of future updates. So far the phablet is at Android 4.3 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HP Slate6 Voicetab will be available in five European markets in May, with prices starting at ?250.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HP Slate7 Voicetab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HP Slate7 Voicetab, as its name suggests, is one of those compact tablets that you can actually use as phones. Awkward as it is, you can lift it up to your face and have a call on it as you would with a normal phone (well, kinda).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HP will be offering the Slate7 Voicetab with an optional Datapass mobile data service. That includes 250MB of data per month for 2 years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7-inch screen of the Slate7 has a resolution of 800 x 1280 pixels. It has really nice viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HP Slate7 Voicetab will cost 259 with Datapass and 229 euro without.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Asus Padfone hands-on photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ASUS didn't have anything new to announce at the MWC 2014, but they did bring their latest Padfone Infinity 2 phone + tablet dock combo along. The Snapdragon 800 5" smartphone packs FullHD resolution and a 13MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of this is put together in a very nice looking package built with a plastic that feels very premium to the touch. It's polycarbonate and has brushed metal like accents on the back cover, which gives it an extra edge in terms of design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone itself isn't the lightest around, but at 145 grams it feels great in hand. The IPS LCD display has solid color reproduction and can be further adjusted from a special ASUS app, which lets you chose from different presets to suite your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the real story behind the ASUS Padfone Infinity 2 is its tablet docking station. It's made of soft touch plastic and besides the 10.1" IPS full HD display, 5000mAh battery, mono speaker and SD card slot, there's nothing else in it. That's why it only weighs 523 grams on its own. Combine it with the Padfone Infinity 2 smartphone and it gets a bit on the heavy side, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Padfone Infinity 2 smartphone didn't experience any problems powering neither the 10.1" tablet, nor itself. Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean runs smoothly, but feels a bit dated. Here's hoping ASUS swiftly launches its KitKat update in the coming weeks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Asus Padfone mini hands-on photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Padfone Infiniti 2's smaller friend, the Padfone mini, also came along. We covered it extensively last month in our hands-on, so we're going to keep it brief.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time, we met the Padfone mini in yellow, and cyan. The soft touch plastic is definitely nice to the touch and doesn't collect fingerprints, but the bright yellow color won't be up to everyone's taste. The mini carries the same excellent dock design from its bigger sibling and the phone snaps into its tablet dock just as securely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ASUS PadFone mini handset measures 124.42 x 61.44 x 6.3-11.2mm, while the ones of the dock are 199.85 x 119.43 x 13.91mm. The phone and the docking station weigh 116g and 260g respectively. Separately their weight is spot on, but put them together and you've got a 376 gram 7" slate, which is 80 grams heavier than the Nexus 7 (2013). Still, it's not the end of the world, but something to consider.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>New YotaPhone hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Yota Device, makers of the first phone with an e-paper display on the back are at the MWC with the Next Generation YotaPhone. Don't call it the YotaPhone 2 though, it's crowd-sourced evolution ? Yota changed it based on feedback of its early adopters, analysts and the media.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The result is a tangible improvement ? the build quality has improved noticeably. We especially like how the e-paper display is integrated into the back, you can't tell it's a screen unless it refreshes. It's also great at keeping fingerprints at bay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This screen is 4.7" big and touch-enabled so you can navigate Android. From what we saw it's unskinned Android, but Yota is working on custom apps that will use both screens (an Office suite is in the works). You can answer calls, read messages and post social networking updates, without having to power on the color screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the e-paper display is not e-Ink like you've seen in Kindles and other e-readers. It has selective refresh, meaning it can update only the parts of screen that change. That means you won't see the characteristic flash when an e-Ink unit updates. It's lit too, so you can use it in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YotaPhone has a power-saving mode that disables the color screen and uses just the e-paper screen. Yota says this mode allows the phone to last over 50 hours between charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color screen is a 5" AMOLED display. The other phone specs are pretty impressive too, thanks to a Snapdragon 800 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Next Generaion YotaPhone will come out in the final quarter of this year in Russia and EMEA. The US and Asian markets will get a version of the phone too, but three to four months later. If you have the first-gen YotaPhone, the company will let you upgrade "at a significant discount." The details of this deal will be unveiled later.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Oppo R1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here goes the Oppo R1 which went official in December. It has a Sony-made Exmor BSI 8MP camera on the back and an 80-degree wide-angle 5MP camera on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone looks pretty cool, with high quality materials and assertive design. At 7.1mm, the Oppo R1 feels incredibly slim and refined. What appears like a mix of aluminum and glass gives it a much more expensive feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It runs Oppo's Color OS - we saw it on the Oppo N1 last year - which is in essence a color-rich interpretation of Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5" 720p screen has great colors and viewing angles too. Even at 294ppi it looks pretty sharp.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Open C<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ZTE is continuing its commitment to the open-source Firefox OS platform. The latest ZTE Open C that runs Firefox 1.3 is a major step forward for the ecosystem, with many improvements to the user interface and general performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Open C itself is an entry level smartphone with a 4" WVGA TFT display. We didn't expect too much from it when the phone got announced, and meeting it in person didn't change our mind. The display has punchy colors but the contrast isn't spectacular, and neither are the viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Open C is made of plastic and looks sharp and modern. The blue color in particular really helps it stand out. The silver accents on the sides are cool, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for Firefox OS, it has come a long way since its inception. That said, despite the improvements to the UI and performance, it's still a bit laggy. Most probably, the entry-level hardware of the Open C are to blame. It packs a 1.2GHz dual-core Cortex-A7 CPU on the Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8210 chipset, with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back there's a 3MP camera and beneath the removable back cover lies a 1,400mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Firefox OS browser is quite intuitive and features a minimalist UI, as does the camera interface. Check out the short user interface video of the ZTE Open C below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Open II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ZTE brought along another Firefox OS running smartphone. The ZTE Open II is even more basic than the Open C and packs only 256MB of RAM on the same MSM8210 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its 3.5" HVGA TFT display is as basic as they get, to be honest. Overall, a phone with this specs is hardly doing Firefox a service, as we're sure the OS would fly on just slightly more capable hardware, say 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the phone's build quality isn't as impressive as that of the Open C. Pricing is yet unknown.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>emporiaSMART hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Emporia hardly rings a bell, in smartphone terms that is, but it isn't a new manufacturer. The company's been focusing on easy to use, basic phones but at the MWC 2014, Emporia introduced its first ever smartphone with a capacitive touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'd think that by 2014, the company should've had at least a bunch of touch-enabled smartphones. It isn't high-end specs though and cutting edge technology they're driven by. Emporia's products are designed for the not so tech-savvy and elderly users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company's first smartphone is called emporiaSMART and features a 4.5" display. It works with a stylus, which sits on the right side of the phone. The company decided to use one after extensive research concluding that elderly people sometimes have problems with dry skin resulting in lack of sensitivity in the fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's user interface has been designed with the seniors in mind as well. The emporiaSMART runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and ease of use was clearly the main objective. Emporia has even developed a web interface that allows remote access of the emporiaSMART phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the remote control panel you can add/edit contacts, locate the phone, set alarms and edit settings. Setting up a phone for a relative has never been simpler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company also announced a pair of radiowatches - one for men and one for the ladies. Radiowatch may sound weird at first, but its concept is simple - it sends a radio signal to the phone, in order to trigger emergency mode. To activate it, the owner has to tap and hold two opposite-facing buttons on the watch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BQ Aquaris hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BQ Aquaris phone is one of the first Ubuntu phones, but unfortunately it wasn't a working prototype so we only got a feel of the exterior design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aquaris has a 4.5" display and is powered by a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor with 1GB RAM, courtesy of MediaTek. The phone will have 16GB of storage and aims for a ?180 / $250 price point.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wiko Highway hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Highway is the higher end of the two devices Wiko showcased at the MWC. It's a dual-SIM phone with a 5" 1080p screen and an octa-core processor. It's about as thin as an iPhone 5s, measuring 7.7mm (0.1mm thicker than the iPhone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wiko Highway has a laminated 5" IPS LCD display with Gorilla Glass 2. It's one of the taller 5" devices we've handled (144 x 70 x 7.7mm), as tall as the Xperia Z1 but narrower and thinner. At 154g it weighs less too. The sides of the device are part of the aluminum frame, similar to Sony's Xperia phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone features a 16MP camera with a BSI sensor courtesy of OmniVision. It can record 1080p video and has the popular effects and modes - HDR, spherical panorama, cinemagraphs and erasing moving objects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera is an 8MP shooter for epic selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Highway runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean on an octa-core Cortex-A7 processor at 2GHz (MediaTek we're guessing). It has 2GB of RAM. The potential downfall of the phone is the limited storage - 16GB built-in storage and no microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a 2,350mAh Li-Po battery, which should last 11-12 hours of 3G calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wiko Highway is available right now in Europe at ?350.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wiko WAX hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wiko WAX has a 4.7" 720p screen with Corning Gorilla Glass 2. The image quality is quite good with excellent viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WAX is the first phones with NVIDIA's new Tegra 4i chipset - the first from the GPU maker that features an integrated LTE modem. The 4i is based on Cortex-A9r4 quad-core processor at 2.3GHz and the same GPU tech as the Tegra 4, but with fewer cores (60 vs. 72). We have some benchmarks from the WAX, you can find them at the bottom of the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has 1GB RAM and runs Android 4.3. Storage is a tight 4GB, but there's a microSD card slots (cards up to 32GB are supported). TegraZone is preinstalled on the WAX to give user access to Tegra-optimized games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the back of the Wiko WAX is an 8MP shooter and there's a 5MP camera on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone itself feels very light - perhaps too light for our taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you haven't heard of Wiko, it's an up and coming French phone maker and so the WAX will be available in Europe this April. There's no info on price just yet but NVIDIA says the Android 4.4 update will roll out shortly after launch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wiko synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We ran several benchmarks on the Wiko phones and it turns out four Cortex-A9 (revision 4) cores and eight Cortex-A7 perform at the same level. The A9s have a clockspeed advantage though - 2.3GHz vs. 2GHz.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gionee E7 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Chinese manufacturer Gionee announced its Elife E7 flagship back in November last year claiming it to be the best Android cameraphone. Well, it's time to see if their claims are holding true at the MWC 2014 floor where it is hoping to make visitors go wow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elife E7 sports a 5.5-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The numbers add up to a pixel density of 401ppi, which is tack sharp by any standard. E7 is also equipped with Gorilla Glass 3, which rounds up its high-end profile quite nicely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the hood there's a 2.2GHz quad-core Krait 400 processor on a Snapdragon 800 chipset. The E7 with 16GB of internal storage will feature 2GB of RAM, while the 32GB model has 3GB of RAM on-board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the part where Gionee claims the Elife E7 sports the best camera that's currently employed by any Android smartphone out there. We're going to put it head to head against the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which we have laying around to test Gionee's claims.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before that, though, let's brief you through its specs sheet. It's 16 megapixels of higher than the usual 1.34µm pixel size, and there's also an 8 megapixel front-facing shooter. The primary camera lens utilizes a lens designed called Largan M8 and is said to deliver super sharp images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how it compares against the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for its build quality, the Elife E7 isn't quite as spectacular - its glossy back looks rather poorly and doesn't feel too great either. Bezels could obviously be better too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gionee Elife S5.5 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for the Gionee S5.5, it features a significantly better build quality. In fact, we have no trouble calling it superb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fancy metal frame makes it feel great in hand. It really does feel genuinely premium and the slim profile helps its cause a great deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not all roses and sunshine, though. The camera hump at the back isn't ideal and is prone to scratching, if not worse. However, it's not enough to make us turn our backs on the phone's looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This all makes the Elife S5.5 the thinnest smartphone in the world at just 5.55mm thick. The Elife S5.5 runs an Android-based Amigo OS, sports an octa-core 1.7 GHz processor, 2GB of RAM and a duo of 13 MP and 5 MP cameras (back and front).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device also has a 5" screen, 2,300 mAh battery that should go a full day with 3G on - an LTE version will be arriving in June.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the phone in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also ran a couple of benchmark tests to see if the S5.5 is as fast as it is slim.</paragraph>
