			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A sequel to a bestseller, the Samsung S5260 Star II has good genes and a lot to live up to. Building on a successful recipe is a shortcut to success and that?s exactly what Samsung have done with the Star follow-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest TouchWiz interface puts users in control of the Samsung S5260 Star II. It?s the feature phone variety of TouchWiz rather than the Bada OS but, with added multitasking and improved homescreen, Bada won?t be badly missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are always ups and downs to buying a phone in this class ? here?s the list of pros and cons for the Samsung S5260 Star II.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S5260 Star II at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The lack of 3G connectivity isn?t a surprise on the Star II ? Samsung wanted it to be as affordable as possible. The lack of multitouch though is a disappointment ? it?s one of the major points of a capacitive screen. We should note perhaps that the unit we tested wasn?t completely finalized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the basic package is good and the new software ticking inside the S5260 Star II can make all the difference. Wi-Fi will make up for the lack of 3G ? after all, it?s not common to buy an affordable phone and use it with an unlimited data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the hand, the Samsung S5260 leaves a positive impression. It is well put together and the materials are pleasant to the touch ? ?affordable? doesn?t feel ?cheap? here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, will the Samsung S5260 get its own star on the Walk of Fame? Let?s hope our walkthrough of hardware and software will give us a better idea. Step right up...</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S5260 Star II 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II hasn?t fallen too far from the proverbial tree ? it borrows the overall design from the original Star. Still, the choice of materials and design refreshments have done the S5260 Star II a lot of good. Quite importantly, the Star II has kept its friendly size ? the phone measures 107.5 x 54.0 x 12.4 mm and weighs 94g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S5260 Star II is not a completely new design but the original best selling recipe didn?t need more than a few better ingredients anyway: a capacitive display, a standard microUSB port and even Wi-Fi connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A facelift is also on the list of updates. The original Star wasn?t exactly a looker but it still sold in droves. The S5260 Star II has more charm to it, which is essential ?touchscreen feature phones are all over the place these days. The design is very clean ? the front for one is a single piece instead of a mismatched collection of materials we sometimes see in low-end phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3? WQVGA capacitive touchscreen is the centerpiece of the front panel. Its brightness, contrast and color rendering are OK though nothing special. The viewing angles are good though and the capacitive sensor is well calibrated. It responds to very light presses but it?s not overly eager to register a touch, reducing the number of accidental presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility isn't one of the strong suits of the display, mainly because of the high reflectivity of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there's just the earpiece - there's no ambient light sensor to adjust the brightness or a proximity sensor to automatically lock the touchscreen during calls. Below the screen there are three hardware keys - the receiver keys on the left and right and the menu button in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three hardware controls are prominent and thumb-friendly but not particularly good-looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side of the S5260 Star II features the Power/Lock key and the microSD card slot, which is covered by a plastic flap. On the left side there isn?t much to see other than the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port are found on top of the Star II. The microUSB port is protected from dust by a sliding cover, while the audio jack is left open. The bottom of the phone has just the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our test Star II unit is white and it has a white lacquer back cover ? it looks pretty good and it hides fingerprints quite well. Samsung will also offer a black one too but we guess the white one will be in the center of their marketing campaign. After all, there are bucket loads of black phones in this price segment, while white ones are few and far between.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel uncovers the 1000mAh battery and the SIM compartment. So far we don?t have an official battery life rating from the manufacturer, however during our test the Star II clocked in 3 days of moderate usage with GSM standby and Wi-Fi on all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, Feb 1: We spend some more time with the Samsung Star II for a more extensive battery test and the results were impressive. From a full charge, it took almost 10 days to drain the battery. During that time, we made 50 minutes of calls, Wi-Fi was off but there was the occasional connection with a Bluetooth headset and we also browsed several web pages over the mobile internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II is tall and not too wide, making it comfortable to use as a handset and the slightly rounded back and sides improve the feel of the phone in the hand. Pocketability isn't an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Star II is a simple but solidly built phone and Samsung does deserve credit for the choice of materials. The controls are easy to reach and press, leaving us with no major complaints (at its low-end price point).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface ? feature phone TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz has gained popularity with its Android and Bada versions but it?s also the key ingredient of Samsung?s touch operated feature phones too. The Samsung S5260 Star II runs one of the latest version available ? 3.0 ? and it?s hard to tell that it?s not Bada running inside. Well, it isn?t, just so e make that clear right from the start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface has a noted Android feel to it and though it?s not quite as polished as the droid TouchWiz, it?s a match for Bada in terms of usability. You don?t get the abundance of third party apps you get with Android (or even Bada) as you have to rely on Java apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s still a good selection of Java apps (Opera Mini, Google Maps, etc.) and even games. Samsung Apps will come in handy here, but we?ll cover that later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz homescreen is widget-based and you can place around as many widgets as you can fit. When you run out of space, you can add new homescreens and easily rearrange the old ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Widget button lets you pull out more widgets (or put some away) from the tray at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can put as many widgets as you can fit on the homescreen and they can?t overlap. If there isn't enough room on the current homescreen, it will automatically scroll to an empty one when you pull out a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 14 widgets preinstalled but you can download more from the Samsung Apps store included on board the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the homescreen there are three virtual buttons ? Keypad, Contacts and Messages. They are visible in the main menu too, but unfortunately they can?t be changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu stretches over several different screens (up to five), which are sweep-scrollable sideways. Only native apps can be put in the menu ? it would have been better if you could put shortcuts to Java apps though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each page in the main menu consists of a 3x4 shortcuts. The shortcuts are big and easily thumbable. This time Samsung has gone for a simple two-color design instead of their usual colorful set of icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcuts can be re-arranged or you can get them sorted automatically based on how frequently you use them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5260 Star II features multitasking complete with a task manager. As usual, you press and hold the menu key to bring up the task manager and you can switch between apps (both native and Java) and kill apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To minimize an app, you hit the menu key. The red key works a little inconsistently ? it exits some app but brings up a dialog for others (which offers to exit the app, go back to the app or minimize it). Maybe when the software is finalized, there will be more consistency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An Android-inspired feature is the panel on the top of the screen ? you open and close it with taps (no scrolling) and from there you can toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and silent mode on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player and radio controls also appear there when the respective app is active. This way the playback controls let you control the playback from almost anywhere (the panel is accessible from anywhere but Java apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock screen is the typical Samsung ?sweep to unlock? lock screen. When you have a missed call, a puzzle piece appears, which will unlock the phone and open up the call log if you put it in its place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some shortcuts in the main menu also show a number in their top right corner ? like number of missed calls, unread emails and so on. These notifications also appear in the top panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II packs an accelerometer, which does the two usual tricks ? screen rotation and turn to mute ? but there?s a handy shortcut with it too. A double tap can launch one of the phone apps ? browser, contacts, music player, or anything else from the main menu really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing you?re likely to see on the lock screen is the CD icon on top. It appears when the music player (or radio) is playing or it?s paused and shows the track info along with the previous, next and play/pause buttons.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Gallery is built into the file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S5260 Star II gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and launching it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images. You?ll want to switch to Thumbnail view though (it puts the thumbnails in a grid).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep your fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the images is fast and responsive and zooming into 3MP images is no problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no pinch zooming despite the fact the Star II has a capacitive display. Instead, you have the one-finger zoom, which kicks in after you touch the image with your thumb for a second or two. Once it?s activated, it starts zooming in before you?ve even moved your finger, which is annoying if you?re trying to zoom out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing images in landscape mode is also available and the rotation is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player rocks with DNSe<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard 3.5 mm audio jack and the microSD card slot, the S5260 music functionality is complemented by the great music player usually found on Samsung devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background (you can control it from the notification area or the lock screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5260 Star II equalizer offers the standard presets like pop, jazz, classic, as well as widening, dynamic and surround effects. You can?t create custom equalizers, but with such a wide selection of presets you really won?t need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DNSe sound enhancing technology offers Externalization, Music clarity, Bass enhancement, Mega bass, Wide and Concert hall presets for an even better sonic experience. There?s also a virtual 5.1 channel mode too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find music service is a tap away and can be used to identify music playing from somewhere else, e.g. at the café, by sampling about 10 seconds from it and looking it up online. There?s also a Find similar, which looks for songs similar to the one you?re currently listening to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Radio has RDS, can record too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star features an FM radio with RDS. There's an option to record radio broadcasts as well, which can be a cheapo way to get individual tracks or whole music sets off the radio.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bare-bone 3MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II is equipped with a 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera that can take photos with a maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. The hardware is very bare-bones - all you get is the camera, no flash or lens protection, not even a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the camera interface is nicely touch-optimized and has a number of nice built-in features like smile shot, preset scenes, on-screen guidelines and panorama mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a 3MP snapper, the camera on the Samsung S5260 is actually pretty good. Noise levels are low and there?s a decent amount of detail in the photos (though the work of the noise reduction algorithm is visible in the trees and foliage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos usually turn out with pleasing colors and contrast. Here are several photo samples, so you can judge for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II offers video recording too, but it's nothing to get excited about - it can only manage QVGA at 15fps. Still, we wouldn?t use it for anything other than MMS. Now here's a sample if you want to check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video sample from the S5260 video sample at 15fps.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic browser and average connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 Star II is not particularly impressive in terms of connectivity ? you get quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE but no 3G. To its credit, it does have Wi-Fi b/g/n, which means you won?t miss the 3G connectivity when there?s a hotspot around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5260 web browser looks very much like its Bada OS sibling but it doesn?t offer much functionality. There is autosuggestion for the URL bar, which means you won?t have to type much on the uncomfortable keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are bookmarks too along with history list and a list of most visited sites (displayed as thumbnails). The browser supports kinetic scrolling and one-finger zoom. That about exhausts the list of browser features - there?s no text reflow or Flash support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had some nice time with the Samsung Star II. We used an early pre-production sample for this review so there are bound to be changes in the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some things didn?t even work right off the bat ? like the SNS integration, for instance. The Samsung Apps store is something else we?ll have to revisit ? it was empty when we tried it (and perhaps not even complete).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But does the Samsung S5260 deserve the star in its name? Well, the answer is ?not quite?. We were pleased to see the updated hardware ? it looks so much better than the original, especially with Wi-Fi b/g/n added to the mix. And the TouchWiz 3.0 UI is great, for a second it had us fooled that the Star II actually runs Bada OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But when you factor in other features ? no multitouch, no 3G, basic camera and browser, the upgrade over the original Samsung S5230 Star and its offshoots (such as the Wi-Fi enabled S5230W) doesn?t seem that big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the original Star sold in over 30 million units despite it didn?t have Wi-Fi and only had a nasty proprietary port. But it first came out about a year and a half ago and we think even entry-level touch handsets are entitled to some upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking through our database, there are plenty of similar phones in terms of specs ? both feature phones and smartphones ? so the market success of the Start II will depend on the price. We hope it will be capable of matching the success of its predecessor.</paragraph>
