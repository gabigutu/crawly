			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>CES 2015 is now well under way and we've already seen numerous intriguing devices come out under various other brands, big and small. Smartphones may be our specialty, but we're also in other smart gadgets too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>On these pages we'll try to cover those who didn't get their own spot on the front page for one reason or the other - most often due to their announcement not being as high profile as the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony didn't have a phone or a tablet to announce, but they showed a new expensive high-end Walkman music player and an updated version of their Smartwatch 3 with a metal wristband.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft announced the cheap Nokia 215, a simple phone, whose main merits are the VGA camera and the on-board flashlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer announced another smartphone at CES - the Acer Liquid Z410 - but we also used the opportunity to check out their recently announced Liquid Jade S as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also got to see in person the return of the expensive luxurious phones. The recently announced Lamborghini phone was present as well on the CES 2015 show floor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dell Venue 8 7000 proved more technologically impressive with hair-thin bezels around its 8.4" AMOLED display and its depth-sensing triple camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel came out with a circular smartwatch that plays nice with both iOS and Android. It doesn't run Android Wear though. It's still more feature-packed than a Pebble, but it lacks its developed app store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There will surely be more to see in the days ahead, so check back daily for fresh content.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Smartwatch 3 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's presence on the CES stage was rather lacking in the mobile sector. Only a couple of announcements are worth noting. The company's latest wearable - the SmartWatch 3, which hit consumer markets late 2014 is receiving a visual overhaul. Sony is swapping out the original colorful plastic straps for a metal band, in hopes of bringing a more stylish and refined look to the rectangular accessory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the watch retains its initial hardware specs - 1.6-inch, 320 x 320 pixel transflective LCD, Qualcomm processor, built-in GPS, and standard microUSB port charging. Granted the SmartWatch 3 does look a lot more refined with the new metal exterior and coincidentally or not it also brought about an upgrade in the device's resistance rating, bumping it from IP58 to IP68.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony NW-ZX2 Music Player hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In other weird Sony related news the Walkman brand is apparently still a thing as it managed to "walk" its way onto the CES stage in the form of the NW-ZX2 "High-Res Digital Music Player". The device is borderline weird. In its essence it is an Android-powered device that supports FLAC/ALAC (up to 96kHz/24-bit) playback for the whopping price tag of $1,200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dedicated premium portable music player is weird enough as it is by 2015 standards, but a horribly overpriced one just seems unmarketable. Besides the FLAC capabilities, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth with SBC/LDAC hi-fidelity codec the Sony NW-ZX2 has little to offer. Its built-in 128GB storage does seem massive on paper, but audiophiles will agree it is less than impressive by their standards. An SD card slot is present, but the price tag seems to demand something better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 480 x 854 pixel 4-inch screen only intensifies this general feeling and so does the complete absence of a bundled headset of any kind. The player, as already mentioned does run Android, but sadly it is 4.2 Jelly Bean, which again seems unacceptable for a brand new device aimed towards very select premium markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NW-ZX2 looks exquisite and feels very nice to the touch. The physical buttons feel very durable and are neatly and considerately tugged away to prevent annoying accidental pocket pressing. It appears that a lot of work has been put into designing a superbly looking device, but the whole experience is all but ruined from the grainy looking display and kind-of misused out-of-date Android OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Jade S hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer listened carefully to what customers didn't like about the Liquid Jade and announced an improved version of the phone back in December - the Liquid Jade S. CES 2015 gives us the first opportunity to see it in person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone keeps the visual aesthetics of its predecessor and looks the part. We especially like the phone's slimness and tapered edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Liquid Jade S measures 7.8mm thick, just 0.3mm more than the past version, and weighs 116 grams. That's because Acer has fitted a slightly larger battery - 2,300mAh vs. 2,100mAh. When you add all of this together and throw in the new textured back, the Liquid Jade S feels entirely different and a lot better than the Liquid Jade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer has kept the 5" 720p IPS display and it looks decently well. Under the hood, there's a change in the chipset. Instead of the Mediatek MT6582 with a quad-core 1.3GHz Cortex-A7, the company has fitted the Liquid Jade S with the newer, 64-bit Mediatek MT6572M. The phone enjoys the added oomph of an octa-core 1.5GHz Cortex-A53 CPU and 2GB of RAM, instead of just 1GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is running the latest revision of Android KitKat, which is unfortunate, as we hoped to see Lollipop run on Acer phones. We're sure Acer will push an update to the latest version of Android soon enough, although we haven't heard anything specific.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the front-facing camera is improved and is now 5MP. We didn't have the proper conditions to test it, since the lighting wasn't ideal, but it should perform much better than the old 2MP snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Jade S will retail for ?299 and will debut in Europe, Middle East and Asia later in January.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Z410<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer also introduced a more budget-oriented offering at CES 2015 in the face of the Liquid Z410. It packs LTE connectivity and a 4.5" qHD display with a rather low qHD resolution resulting in a pixel density of 245ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes in an interesting color scheme, but even this can't help its rather uninspiring design. Still, it's at least fast with a 64-bit quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU, a Mali-T760 GPU and 1GB of RAM. Just like its larger brother, the Liquid Z410 sports DTS Studio Sound, which should in theory grant it an advantage when it comes to sound quality. The CES showroom floor is quite loud and we couldn't estimate the quality that the front-facing speakers provide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, there's also a 5MP snapper shooting 720p video, while a 2MP front-facing camera takes care of selfies. The phone runs Android 4.4.4 KitKat extremely well, but sadly the experience is rather spoiled due to the low resolution of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16GB internal storage is expandable via the microSD card slot. The phone features a beefy 2,500mAh Li-Po battery, which Acer says can hold up to 400 hours of stand-by time. Expect the phone to come out by the end of January with a ?129 price tag.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 215 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 215 made its way to the big CES stage this year which is a mighty fine achievement for what is a pretty low-profile device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With its bright plastic exterior, 2.4-inch screen and round physical keypad, the Nokia 215 is definitely a throwback to a simpler time for mobile tech. But surprisingly, the Nokia 215 is designed to deliver an engaging online experience even in this rather traditional form factor. Microsoft introduced the little handset as the "most affordable Internet-ready entry-level phone" in their portfolio to date and with a price tag of $29 before taxes, it seems quite credible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet is a big part of what the Nokia 215 aims to be. The phone comes preloaded with Facebook along with Messenger, Twitter, Opera Mini and an instant notification system that keeps you up to date and online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device definitely looks and feels solid. It is available in three colors - black, white and vibrant green and its plastic feels really sturdy to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 215 definitely seems built to last and should provide enough modern-day online functionality in a more than traditional package to make it very suitable for the conservative phone users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice little touch is the availability of a Dual-SIM version of the Nokia 215 as well as a handy built-in torch. Other notable aspects of the phone include a 256K colors TFT panel with a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels, which is adequate for the size and everything is clearly readable. A camera is also present, albeit a less than meager 0.8MP one, but at this point is seems they just threw it in as a bonus, given the price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microSD slot is also hidden away under the back cover, which is of little use for storing multimedia for playback, but does provide a handy way to carry around files and share them using the built-in Bluetooth and SLAM sharing technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If not that, it can always double as a reliable MP3 player slash radio which is definitely aided by the impressive 50h music playback battery life and whopping 29 days worth of stand-by time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the Nokia 215 only comes with 2G connectivity and no Wi-Fi as well, but how picky can you be for $29. The little device is definitely a solid entry-level phone and feels very well built.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lamborghini Tauri 88 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lamborghini Tauri 88 was announced last December, but it is just now that we get our hands on the designer smartphone. Lamborghini were kind enough to bring a sample of the $6,000 limited edition phone for the public to enjoy and we just couldn't miss the opportunity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lamborghini Tauri 88 has a 5" 1080p display and makes use of the snappy Snapdragon 801 chipset with 3 gigs of RAM. The rest of its specs include a 20MP rear cam, a 8MP front snapper, 64GB expandable storage and a beefy 3,400 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tauri 88 is made of steel (available in Gold, Black or plain steel colors) and leather (a choice of Black, Blue, Red, Orange and Brown) complete with decorative stitches. The phone was designed in Italy and sports the recognizable raging bull logo (which was inspired by the Taurus constellation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the unit we saw uses the Gold Steel/Blue Leather combo and it looks gorgeous. Steel and leather provide for a great handling and in every single moment you'll love the touch of this phone at your hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tauri 88 has the usual set of controls - the capacitive Android controls at front and a volume rocker on the right. Its top houses the 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary mic, while the bottom has the loudspeaker and the primary mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear of the Lamborghini Tauri 88 is really beautiful with probably a Sony-made 20MP camera sensor surrounded by a combination of leather and steel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lamborghini Tauri 88 runs on Android OS with customized Android launcher with an Lamborghini theme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only 1947 units of the Tonino Lamborghini Tauri 88 phones have been produced, each costing $6,000. In case you were wondering, Antonio "Tonino" Lamborghini is the son of Ferruccio, the founder of Lamborghini, and was born in 1947.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dell Venue 8 7000<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've been waiting for this one and it was well worth the wait. The Dell Venue 8 7000 is one of few all-aluminum tablets and one of few AMOLED-packing ones too. This puts it in a fairly exclusive position, but it gets better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet is made of anodized aluminum and measures just 6mm thick. For comparison, an iPad mini 3 is 7.5mm thick, the iPad Air 2 is 6.1mm and the Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact is 6.4mm. It's not just the thin profile though, the Venue 8 7000 has stunningly thin bezels around its 8" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They make the Dell narrower than the iPad mini 3, though it is taller since loudspeaker and front-facing camera are positioned below the screen on the one bezel that this tablet has. Dell calls this an "infinity display" and for once the name is fitting. The tablet is quite light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is an 8.4" AMOLED with 2,560 x 1,600px resolution, most likely borrowed from the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4. The contrast and colors have the usual AMOLED pop, though we'd like to see it in better lighting, since we had some concerns about the similar Galaxy Tab S 8.4 display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Dell Venue 8 7000 is powered by an Intel Atom quad-core processor and runs Android 4.4 KitKat. A Lollipop update is on the way, says Dell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Intel chipset provides solid performance and soon there will be an LTE version of the tablet, thanks to Intel's modem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the chipset currently does is command the trio of cameras on the back. That's right, three - an 8MP main camera plus two 720p camera used for Intel's RealSense that can calculate the distance to objects in the scene. This is used for Lytro/HTC One (M8) style depth effects in the camera for now. Measuring distance and size of objects is possible too, though admittedly less Instagram-able.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dell Venue 8 7000 is available in the US at $400 for now (From Dell.com and Best Buy) and headed to Canada by the end of the week. The UK, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, China, India, Japan and several other countries are getting it in "early" 2015.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few accessories are available for the tablet, including a $90 wireless keyboard and a $40 folio case (that can act as a stand) and a $30 sleeve. Note that if you get those in a pack with the tablet you get a discount, the keyboard, for one, drops to $50.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel One Touch Smart Watch hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel jumps into the smartwatch business with the One Touch Watch, but despite having made so many Android phones, this device does not use Google's platform. Instead Alcatel developed its own software, trying to keep the most useful features on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is similar to that of the Moto 360, down the bottom part that's cut out. The bezels are much thicker though - the hour marks around the dial are painted on the plastic. While this knocks it down several pegs from the premium feel of the Motorola watch, this one has pricing on its side - $150.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the bottom area of the watch face is touch sensitive and tapping it switches between the watch and the menu. A heart rate sensor, barometer, accelerometer and compass keep detailed track of your movements for the built-in health functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch has a companion app for Android and iOS that lets you choose which apps can push notifications to the watch. The Alcatel One Touch Watch will also alert you if your phone goes out of range and you can go back and make it ring to find it easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch itself is a tad smaller than the Moto 360 and other than the thick bezels, the build quality is surprisingly pleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel is saying it will last two days (up to 5 in perfect conditions), which isn't Pebble territory but still better than what some Android Wear devices are pulling. There's a USB connector built into the strap so you can charge your watch in any USB port, though this means standard watch straps will not work for the One Touch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Redesigned BlackBerry Passport for AT&amp;T hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>AT&amp;T and BlackBerry sure seem to be getting along well these days. The carrier has once again announced that it will be selling the BlackBerry Passport smartphone. This has happened before, back in September. So far, though, the Passport has eluded AT&amp;T's network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's bound to land soon, however, and when it does it will be slightly redesigned. Gone are the square corners from the international model, and in are some rounded corners that have been apparently requested by AT&amp;T. BlackBerry complied with that request, which might explain why it's taking so long for the Passport to actually make it to the carrier's stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The redesigned BlackBerry Passport for AT&amp;T compared to the original</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that with the redesign (which changes nothing else about the device except its corners) comes a slightly more affordable price tag. While last year AT&amp;T said it would sell the Passport for $249 with a two-year contract, that's been changed to a more palatable $199.99.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sans contract, you'll need to shell out $649.99 for one. And you can also get the Passport with AT&amp;T's Next installment plans - opting to pay nothing upfront, then followed by 20 or 24 equal monthly payments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news is that AT&amp;T still doesn't have an actual release date for the device. Apparently we should expect more details "in the coming weeks". The same situation is true for the BlackBerry Classic, which will make it to the carrier "in the near future".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also managed to snap a few photos of the red color of the original BlackBerry Passport. The red version was announced and made available last year in the end of November as a holiday treat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Panasonic Lumix Smart Camera CM1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Panasonic announced its re-entering into the smartphone market last September at the Photokina 2014 expo. After its attempt to generate sales from smartphones for the developing markets and the unsuccessful Eluga lineup, it seemed Panasonic has decided to bet on something popular and quite well selling - the Lumix brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panasonic Lumix Smart Camera CM1 is indeed quite an interesting device. Depending on how you want to look at things, it's either a smartphone with a great camera strapped to it, or the other way round. It's a great competitor to the niche cameraphone Samsung Galaxy K Zoom and looks quite appealing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panasonic Lumix Smart Camera CM1 uses a 20MP 1" sensor with F/2.6 Leica lens. The camera gives you full manual control via appropriate hardware controls and software controls and is capable of 4K video recording at 15 fps and 1080p capturing at 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CM1 device is quite capable of running perfectly smooth its Android KitKat OS as well as behaving buttery smooth under pressure thanks to its Snapdragon 801 chip and 4.7" 1080p touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panasonic has brought the Lumix Smart Camera CM1 at CES in Vegas and you bet we took our time to play with the intriguing gadget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first impression was very positive - the cameraphone is of a great build, with excellent grip which is a must have for such kind of a device. The sides are made out of metal, while the rest of the phone is matte plastic with leather pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is very easy to operate even in manual mode and we really liked the front control ring. We really would have appreciated a xenon flash in addition to the LED one, but nevertheless it is big enough and seems to provide adequate lighting for the low-light scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panasonic Lumix Smart Camera CM1 is a bit bulky at 21mm thickness, but that was to be expected and can't be hold against it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We left the Panasonic Lumix Smart Camera CM1 at Panasonic's booth with overall positive impression, but we are eager to meet it for a full-blown review and beyond in 2015.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Kodak IM5 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Kodak, once a cornerstone in the photography industry, has taken a stab in the smartphone market. Meet the Kodak IM5, but don't be prejudicedabout it, because it's not what you'll initially think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IM5 runs Android and is specially designed to be people's first or last smartphone, as it's made specifically for toddlers and seniors. Strange, we know, since you'd expect Kodak to make a photography-oriented product. It still has a strong bid on photography, but not in the hardware sense. More on that later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The truth is that the camera manufacturer Kodak as you may have known it is long gone and today, an OEM manufacturer called Bullitt stands behind the Kodak-branded phones (and also behind phones of other brands too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Kodak IM5 sports a surprisingly clean and straightforward approach to a smartphone user interface. The main culprit for this is the Kodak-made homescreen launcher, which sports a grid of icons for email, phone dialer, messages and even a magnifier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of this comes to you in a sweet looking package. The Kodak IM5 has a safe, understated design with a black matte finish on the back and a glossy plastic rim on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 5" IPS 720p display, which looks nice, albeit a bit lacking in resolution for our taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's quite fast thanks to the MediaTek MT6592 chipset with an octa-core 1.7GHz processor, though there is only 1GB of RAM. The phone runs Android 4.4.4 KitKat. Judging by the plethora of software tweaks Kodak has added to the user interface, it'll take them some time to get an update to Lollipop out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, those tweaks are very nice and are mainly concerning photography. For instance, you can print a photo you've taken right from the homescreen or approve photos you've taken before they get stored on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera itself is a 13MP snapper, which doesn't sound glamorous, but it does the job. We couldn't get much more details than this, though. We'll have to wait a bit more to find out the sensor sitting behind the lens. At the front, there's a 5MP snapper and the rest of the specs include 8GB built-in storage and a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Kodak IM5 will launch in Europe in March with a &#x20ac;229 price tag, which sounds reasonable enough. We can't wait to take a more in-depth look at this promising phone when it hits store shelves.</paragraph>
