			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Luxury phones are having a tough time being unique nowadays. The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness is having a hard time being? luxurious. But that?s no way to start a proper review now, is it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There we go again then. Rare metals and precious stones are commonplace, but a transparent screen? Now, that?s a first. The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness keeps only the essential phone functions and that explains the Pureness moniker. And just like a proper luxury phone, it comes with a concierge service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access the concierge service 24/7 via a phone call or email and have them book you a hotel room, buy tickets for a game or ask for advice. But it?s not just a simple booking service ? going through the concierge service has some perks, like free room upgrades in some hotels, discounts (well, well), complementary champagne and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see, the luxury of owning a Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness doesn?t just come from what?s in the phone itself. But since we?re not going to be using the concierge service anytime soon, let?s focus on what the phone has to offer:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A phone with a transparent screen is nothing short of unique. But the display certainly is a liability in terms of actually using the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness. It limits the physical space available inside the phone, leaving Sony Ericsson engineers with very little room to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, the low-resolution greyscale display makes a camera (even just a video call camera) and proper web browsing pointless. This leaves tethering as the only reasonable use for the fast 3G data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness is not a gadget. Rather it takes the concept of pureness and runs with it ? by leaving out all the distracting features. Only the essence of a phone remains and the transparent screen acts as the perfect metaphor for this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the next page, we look through the hardware. Literally.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The typical expensive watch is big and heavy and a lot of the luxury phones live by that rule ? they can?t help it with all the precious metal and gemstones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness on the other hand is tiny ? it measures 112 x 43 x 13 mm and is an absolute featherweight at 70 grams.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness is turned off it looks quite intriguing ? the display is icy white, almost translucent. Below is a black plate with three small square knobs and four thinner strips with no symbols on them. Like an ice pop on a chocolate bar instead of a stick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point it?s not easily recognizable as a phone, only the Sony Ericsson logo along the bottom at the front gives it away. A careful inspection of the Pureness reveals the hidden power key on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the XPERIA Pureness on is when the display magic unveils ? in an instant it goes from solid icy white to near transparent. The strips of keys on the keypad are illuminated in turn from top to bottom, like a wave of light washing over the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Four white dots form a D-pad around the central square button, while the two on the side are bordered with a green and red light, so they?re instantly recognizable as call keys. The soft keys and Activity menu and backspace keys appear above and below the call keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great first impression, isn?t it? Unfortunately, after the initial sense of wonder wears off (which happens quite fast) you realize that the display is 1.8? big and monochrome. And the strips of the keypad that look unusual and nice when the lights are off, are actually made of glossy black plastic that is cheap to the touch and wobble and screech when you slide your thumb down the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let?s not get ahead of ourselves and instead get back to the beginning. Since it?s the centerpiece of the Sony Ericsson Pureness, we?ll dedicate a whole chapter of the review to the display. We just need to get through the usual stuff first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first, the plate between the display and the keypad appears flat with no functional elements other than the three square knobs. The tiny keys are raised above their surroundings, so even though they?re small they are easy to find and press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that strip actually has eight buttons on it ? the four directions of the D-pad, the two soft keys, the Activity menu key and the backspace key. They are not touch-sensitive ? the plastic bends as you press them and offers reasonable feedback. However, they are tiny and quite fiddly to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now we come to the very disappointing keypad ? each row of keys is one single strip of bendy plastic and while it?s comfortable enough to type on, the plastic feels very cheap and the buttons creak as you push. That?s totally unacceptable for anything styling itself with the ?luxury? tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness have one volume key each ? the plus key on the right and the minus key on the left. The right side also carries the SIM card slot, hidden under a plastic cover and the left side has? drum roll please? a Fast Port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s left uncovered of course ? after all, who wouldn?t want to see the exposed pins of an old proprietary port on the side of their luxury phone?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a gap on each side of the Pureness - between the front strip with the D-pad and call keys and the metal strip from the back - which lets light spill through. While it may have some purpose, that gap doesn?t really give the impression of precision and craftsmanship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom of the Pureness are not very interesting ? the bottom houses the loudspeaker and that?s it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s not much to note on the back of the phone besides the power key. The key itself is on a strip of black metal ? shame that the designers didn?t use more metal around the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no battery cover here ? the battery on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness is non-removable. The black plastic on the back is good at hiding fingerprints, but the metal quickly becomes a smudgy mess. It?s a small piece anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The labels that usually go under the battery are printed on the metal strip since there is no ?under the battery? here. So, the back proudly bears the FCC number, the ?Do Not Dispose of in Household Waste? symbol (which every luxury item needs) and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness is very compact and as light as a feather ? it?s comfortable to hold in the hand and fits into any pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What?s missing however is that intangible feeling of luxury, a shame really as that?s the market segment they are clearly aiming for. Now, a transparent screen is well worth the fuss. Our only point is the rest of the phone (keypad mostly) looks dirty cheap and about to fall apart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The see-through display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, it?s time to talk about the killer feature of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness ? the transparent screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the phone is off (or locked) the screen has the appearance of frozen glass. When it comes on, the whole display becomes transparent, except for what?s drawn on the screen, which remains grayish white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even when it?s ON, the display is not completely transparent (like a regular window glass) but is slightly tinted. The white pixels are not completely opaque either, so the contrast is quite poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Light backgrounds render the pixels on screen near impossible to see.The small font used in some parts of the interface doesn?t help either. Because the screen has a slight brown-yellowish tint, floors and furniture with a light-colored wood finish, for instance, make things on the screen almost impossible to view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen legibility in bright light and in the dark is good, but on an overcast day things go down ? there?s too much ambient light coming from under the screen and the illumination isn?t strong enough to make up for that. On sunny days however, the white pixels reflect plenty of sunlight so they?re easily visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the contrast is lower than on a regular LCD screen and at 1.8 inches, the interface is pretty cramped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What could have made things a whole lot better for the XPERIA Pureness screen is a really strong screen backlighting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>A transparent interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Pureness interface is the regular Sony Ericsson feature phone UI stripped to the bone. Or dressed to match the Pureness if you wish ? in monochrome. The luxury XPERIA offers nothing more over the standard Sony Ericsson UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with information on top indicating signal strength, the currently used data carrier and battery status. At the bottom of the display you can see the labels for context keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard trio - theme-dependent, grid of icons and single icon view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking. The web tab is missing so you won?t be able to store quick links and bookmarks here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Traditional phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has storage for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way you can set up the phone to autosave to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact employs a tabbed interface that?s well known to anyone who have used a Sony Ericsson handset in the past couple of years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and finally the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you can add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The names of the contact is stored in a single field, but you still have the option to order contacts by first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can search through the contacts list by gradual typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony, sweet concierge service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling of calls is excellent and we didn't experience any voice quality or reception problems with the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness. Call clarity is great both through the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness offers fast 3G connectivity, but has no camera so videocalls are a no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing or ?Smart Search? as Sony Ericsson call it, is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness comes with a 12-month subscription to the Pureness concierge service. The service is available 24/7 via phone or email and it can get you perks like room upgrades in hotels, a VIP welcome, free champagne, discounts, tickets with better seating and so on. The service is country dependent, so make sure to check the list of benefits to see what they have to offer for your locale.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While conducting our traditional speakerphone test with Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness we discovered some disturbing differences between the ringtone and music player performance. The maximum ringing volume was subjectively on the low side, but the device still scored well. Playing back music with the music player however hit the bottom of our chart with a Below Average mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But since this test is most about telephony and ringing volume and the difference is obviously a software glitch, we?ll publish the higher results here. Here is how it compares to some of the other handsets we have tested. You can find information on the actual testing process, along with the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Simple messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness has a very simple messaging menu and doesn?t even offer a threaded view. Anyway it does the job and we have nothing to complain of. Except that reading texts on the display is less than stellar experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a rich T9 dictionary. The SMS and MMS messages share an editor; when typing SMS you can easily convert it into an MMS via the options menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone automatically downloaded the settings for our Gmail email account. Of course, the resolution and screen size are not the best for reading emails ? even with the available zoom options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No media center, but still media capable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness does not feature the flash-based Media Center, it only has the music player from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated gallery and that?s understandable given the size and type of the screen, but you are still able to view images in the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Pureness music player is version 3.0 - a slightly abridged edition of the Walkman player 3.0. The player supports numerous file formats, including the regularly used MP3, WAV, WMA, M4A and E-AAC plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The?s even a video player on the XPERIA Pureness and sorry but that?s like pencil drawings in a Braille book. Videos are played straight in the file manager, with basic play / pause / fast-forward and rewind. The player has quite a simple interface and supports 3GP and MP4 formats and video resolution of up to 640x360 pixels. Landscape (full screen) mode is available too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has a nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is accessible through its original location in the entertainment menu and offers features like "Find similar music", "Send music info via SMS", "TrackID charts" and a very extensive "Artist info" section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID also offers the online search option. It allows fast search in the entire database for artist, album, title, and lyrics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apart from being on the quiet side as far as volume in the headphones is concerned, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness seems fit to replace your dedicated music player. Its audio output is very good all over with no weak points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response remains within 0.09 dB of the perfect straight line, which is as good as perfect for all purposes practical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the readings are also up among the best in class. Here go the results so you can compare it to some of the other handsets we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness frequency response graph</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about our audio quality test here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mid-range connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness is not an internet-centric or multimedia device and scores modestly on connectivity options. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board for worldwide roaming. 7.2 Mbps HSDPA, as well as 2.0 Mbps HSUPA are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Pureness supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no premium connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, GPS, a 3.5 mm audio jack or even microSD card slot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>See-through browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness has an Access NetFront browser v3.4 featuring the extended home screen available in most of the company?s feature phones. Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen, right under a search and an address bar. They grant access to free content, such as clips, tracks and games on the Sony Ericsson site, including a step-by-step guide for setting up email accounts or internet connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elaborate web pages are rendered correctly and there are a number of configurable settings too. View modes include Text only, Pan and Zoom, and Zoom page. The Panning/scrolling speed is up to standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer, which is nice to work with. Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option. It searches the loaded web page but the first match is not immediately listed and you need to press the find key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall browsing on the XPERIA Pureness is not a great experience due to the poor contrast of the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pureness offers the usual set of time-management features. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar. The to-do application allows storing of two types of tasks: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages and the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms are part of the main menu and there are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or every day. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm's behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one. It offers the basic functions, no bells and whistles, but you can run the Converter from there. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the familiar basic applications. The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the available free memory the only restriction.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Only one game onboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is only one game preinstalled on the XPERIA Pureness. Pac-Man is sure to bring back lots of fond memories, but it?s the monochrome display that makes it a real blast from the past.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Pureness is one of the lightest and smallest handsets ever made with a unique design and unparalleled transparent display. It is what Sony Ericsson meant it to be: the simplest of phones, impossible to match. By the sound of it, they can charge whatever they want on something like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pureness is a premium handset and premium handsets are known to get away with just about anything. We?re in no mood anyway to go on and on about what it can?t do. It?s a phone like no other: the point of its screen is to be transparent, not legible. There?s no camera on it ? and some would argue that?s almost as good as having a 2-megapixel fixed focus snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we think there?s something wrong with the XPERIA Pureness. First time we saw pictures of it, we thought it was brilliant. The very concept of a pure, simple, minimalist handset with a translucent screen is perhaps worth a million bucks. Sadly, the reality is pretty underwhelming. The phone doesn?t look its 600 euro price tag. And if we can say that about a phone with an unmatched transparent screen, something?s very wrong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, the premium segment has a different standard of right and wrong. To the extent that poor build quality may pass as a charming eccentricity. Not to say that a certain class of customers will buy just anything as long as it comes bundled with a fat price tag and a concierge service subscription.</paragraph>
