			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Armed to its newly sharpened teeth and carrying the legacy of a legend, the Motorola RAZR XT910 is out looking for blood. The blood of the best Android phones on the market. And it will cut them where it hurts - their screens, chipsets, cameras and build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.3" SuperAMOLED screen boasts higher resolution than, say, the Samsung Galaxy S II. It bumps up the pixel density to 256ppi (up from 217ppi). And with a dual-core processor running at 1.2GHz and 1GB RAM, it's got enough processing power to challenge the other dual-cores. It has an 8MP camera with 1080p recording too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But even those specs just aren?t as impressive as the sheer look of the thing. The RAZR droid is only 7.1mm thick throughout (take that Japan-only phones) and about 10.7mm at the bulge that holds the camera and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, the rest of the specs are pretty exciting too. Here's the best part of them - and the not so good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR may be thin but it's hardly fragile - it uses Kevlar to cover its back and Gorilla Glass to secure the front. It's splash-resistant too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Are the other droids shaking in their boots already? They should be - the Motorola RAZR has an impressive array of accessories by its side, including one that turns it into a full-fledged 14" Android-running netbook (full-size keyboard, Firefox browser, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The expectations are high - with this many talents on its resume, the Motorola RAZR will try to slash other droid's hopes of being the best. But does it have the (retail) package for it? And is the hardware as good as it sounds?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're not afraid of sharp objects, jump to the next page and find out. We've got our first aid kit at hand, just in case.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Motorola RAZR XT910 retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola put the RAZR XT910 in a box that's thinner than usual to emphasize one of the phone's great merits. It still contains all the essentials - a compact charger that uses the microUSB cable, a one-piece headset (in-ear design) and manuals. The earphones are branded ROKR - recycling old glory doesn't stop at RAZR obviously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were kind of hoping for an HDMI cable but microHDMI aren?t that hard to come by. The big-ticket items like the Lapdock 500 Pro or the HD Dock aren?t part of the bundle either, those are sold separately (but we've seen good package deals for the ATRIX, so you might want to wait for one of those if the Lapdock is a must-have).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola RAZR 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR measures 130.7 x 68.9 x 7.1 mm - super slim but not small. It weighs 127g, which isn't much for a droid with a 4.3" screen (but we?ve seen lighter too).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original Motorola RAZR became a design icon and one of the most coveted phones in its time. This new droid reincarnation has a lot to live up to then - and Moto have done a good job at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of the all too common rounded rectangle design, the RAZR is beveled at the corners and the piece of Gorilla Glass is somewhat of a hexagon. The Kevlar back is even more recognizable and brings carbon-fiber-like aesthetics to the phone (we've seen luxury phones with similar kind of finishing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR uses a SuperAMOLED screen that measures 4.3" in diagonal and dominates the front. It has higher resolution than the equally-sized screen on the Samsung Galaxy S II, but unlike it, it uses the old PenTile matrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the qHD resolution of the RAZR's screen gives it higher pixel density - 256ppi for the Motorola vs. 217ppi for the Samsung. You can see the PenTile matrix if you look at it from real close, but at any reasonable distance it's all but invisible. If you put the RAZR and the Galaxy S II side by side and look at text (or something else with a lot of detail), the Galaxy S II actually looks a little sharper even though it has a lower ppi. Again, it's hardly noticeable if you don't have both screens in front of you. We observed the same thing back in the day when we reviewed the Motorola Atrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen offers deep blacks and great contrast the way only an AMOLED can and excellent viewing angles - there's no color or contrast loss at all. It matches the readings for the SuperAMOLED Plus screen on the Samsung Galaxy S II, but it's not the AMOLED brightest display we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information on your display test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, above the display we find proximity and ambient light sensors along with the 1.3MP secondary camera. A notification light will blink green in case of missed events. The earpiece is also here, below the Motorola logo, finely etched in a metal plate that proudly contrasts with its black surroundings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the display are the traditional four capacitive keys in charge of Android navigation - Menu, Home, Back and Search - and the mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Motorola RAZR is where the three wired connectivity ports are lined up within a nice strip of rubberized plastic. They are the 3.5mm audio jack, the microUSB port and the microHDMI port. All three are uncovered and risk getting filled with dust over time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset is very tidy, only featuring the microSIM and microSD card slots hidden under a shared plastic lid. It is hard to open and we're afraid we might at some point pull too hard and damage it. The memory card is very easy to put in and pull out while the SIM card is near impossible to retrieve after it's been inserted. It either doesn't have a push-to-eject compartment, or our unit was faulty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Motorola RAZR features the big Power/Lock key and the volume rocker. The Power/Lock key has a different texture than the volume rocker, so they're easy to tell apart by touch. The volume control is small and not terribly comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Motorola RAZR is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back on the other hand is rather interesting. The phone is a single solid piece - there's no actual battery cover. The Kevlar rear has a distinctive pattern and a nice, rubbery feel to it, which improves grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the back protrudes to accommodate the 8MP camera, the LED flash and the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, most thin phones have such a bulge but it's usually at the bottom making them easier to hold. Putting all those things at the top makes the Motorola RAZR a little head-heavy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, also on the back is the noise-cancellation microphone placed in the same position as the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we can't pop the back cover to take a peek inside, we know there's a massive 1780mAh Li-Ion battery that's officially quoted at 304 hours of standby and 9 hours 20 minutes of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola went for modern durable materials in the construction of the RAZR XT910 and the results are very good. The phone is very solid (it helps that there are no detachable parts) and will slip into any pocket wide enough. The tightly packed internals of the phone enjoy some limited resistance to splashing water, but you have to be careful with it since the wired ports are completely unprotected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR is very thin - thinner than all smartphones we've tested so far - and it feels different. A super slim handset, but rather tall and wide, it's not too comfortable and secure to hold at least at the beginning. The thicker part at the top didn?t prove to be a problem really.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Completely redesigned UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR came with Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread out of the box and a completely new user interface. It's quite nice, with helpful tools to streamline your interaction with your phone but we missed some functionality in some places too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go on, here's the user interface in action to give you an idea of what we're dealing with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock screen is one area where Moto improved on the generic Android solution - you have two horizontal sliders (one for unlock and one to launch the camera) and a ringer toggle in the middle. It's not as multifunctional as HTC's solution, but it beats most other lockscreens we?ve seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen consists of five side-scrollable panes. As you move between them, there's a nice animation complete with shadows to give it a feeling of depth. A tap on the Home key brings you to the middle pane and another tap launches the preview mode so you can quickly skip to any homescreen you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you can't do here is add or remove homescreen panes or use a pinch-zoom gesture to launch the preview mode (you always have to do that with the Home key on the middle pane). You can't rearrange panes while in preview mode either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR comes with a long list of custom widgets to place around the homescreen. Widgets can be resized freely. All you need to do is hold a finger over a widget. Resizing a widget also changes its appearance. Depending on the widget, it can display more or less info when resized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get the full set of Android widgets available on the RAZR. They cannot be resized like the custom-made Motorola widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area swipes down from the top, as usual. It's a clean, unmodified notification area - no quick toggle buttons or anything like that in here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen there is dock with four shortcuts - the rightmost one always brings up the app drawer, but the other three you are free to replace with whatever app you want (even a bookmark or a playlist).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a final extra shortcut, you can also set up the Home key to launch an app on double tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the app drawer, it consists of several pages that can be scrolled horizontally. Each page is a 4 x 5 grid of icons. Apps can be sorted alphabetically, there're other filters as well, including frequently used and recent. The pre-installed apps can also be hidden (those go in the Hidden apps screen that can be accessed from the context menu). The app drawer also features a shortcut to the Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature is Groups - the default ones are All apps, Recent (that's the redesigned task switcher that the Motorola RAZR uses) and Downloaded. You can create custom groups (and assign them custom icons). Later you can put those groups as shortcuts on the homescreen or even in the app dock at the bottom to create an alternative app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we said, the Recent group serves as a task switcher. That's good because it uses the same 4 x 5 grid of icons and fits much more than the standard 2 x 3 task switcher of Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Task Manager too. It has two tabs - Applications and Auto-end list. You can select multiple apps and kill them or add them to the auto-end list. Apps on that list will be killed 2 minutes after you lock the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One really nifty feature that's popular on BlackBerries is the In-pocket detection - the phone will use its proximity and ambient light sensors to detect when you slip it into your pocket (or purse or whatever) and it will automatically lock itself. Note that the phone has to be vertical for this feature to trigger (to avoid mis-predictions if you put the phone face down on the table).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR is powered by a Texas Instruments OMAP 4430 chipset. In it, there are two Cortex-A9 cores running at 1.2GHz, 1GB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX540 GPU. It sounds like a nice setup - let's see what our benchmarks will show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the single-threaded BenchmarkPi and the muti-threaded Linpack benchmarks and the Motorola RAZR managed to beat the HTC Sensation XE (which has two 1.5GHz CPU cores) but was behind Samsung's custom Exynos chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the 3D benchmark, the RAZR is at a bit of a disadvantage compared to the Galaxy S II as it uses a higher qHD resolution (same as the Sensation XE). The GPU bested the Adreno 220 in the Sensation XE but couldn?t top 30fps (keep in mind that benchmarks are usually heavier than actual games).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript engine in the RAZR's browser proved rather good as it matched the performance of the Galaxy S II (despite the lower CPU scores). The Motorola RAZR was ahead of the Sensation XE here, but HTC's browser does best in the combined HTML5 benchmark, BrowserMark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There the RAZR came a distant second, but ahead of Samsung's offerings (even the faster clocked Exynos in the Note). This goes to show you it's not all about raw power - software optimization goes a long way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has SNS integration, is pretty standard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contacts are part of the Phone app and the layout is pretty standard - you get a list of all contacts sorted alphabetically with an alphabet scroll so you can quickly jump to a letter. Quick contacts are available too for easy access to some features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be synced with multiple services, including Google's own, Exchange accounts, Facebook, Twitter and others. Viewing an individual contact is pretty standard too, except the Contact History option, which brings up a popup with the communication history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add new phonebook fields besides the preset ones. There?s no limit to the fields you can add to a contact. You can also link contacts, which puts someone's information from the multiple services into a single, combined entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also star contacts so they go into the Favorites tab of the Phone app or organize them into groups.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has Smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR didn?t have any reception issues while in a call and the sound was loud and clear. The Motorola RAZR also features a secondary microphone to suppress ambient noise during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is enabled on the RAZR, which is great as it spares you the time to go into your phonebook or a specific contact widget to find a contact. It shows only one matching contact at a time - you can use the down arrow to reveal all the suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice commands are here too (a custom Motorola job), available through a handy shortcut in the dialer. You can use them to dial, send a message play a song and a few other options. A press and hold on the Search key will bring up the default Android voice command feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One feature we missed was the turn to mute functionality. What you can do is make the phone read out the caller ID for an incoming call, assign custom ringtones to contacts or send their calls straight to voicemail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Motorola RAZR. The handset rated as Very Good and it's vibration was quite strong too. You shouldn?t have issues hearing it even in louder environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging all-in-one<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola's messaging app is pretty powerful - it combines a unified inbox, standard text messaging, Gmail, Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS department (called Text Messaging) is pretty much your ordinary Android ? threaded messaging is enabled and the message composer has a neat and simple interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tap-to-compose box starts off with two lines but it will expand as you go. If need be, it will even fill the whole screen, which is really nice for longer texts. You also get a quick character counter (and message part counter) as you type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is pretty simple - you just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Twitter and Facebook also get inboxes in the Messaging app - here you'll find only messages addressed to you, rather than all status updates from your contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email with combined inbox, conversation view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For email there are the Gmail app and a generic email app. In Gmail, batch operations are supported and allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. You can enable push email or schedule automatic updates. There?s an option to only sync over Wi-Fi, which is sure to save you data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messaging app also works for Gmail and other services. It supports batch operations along with conversation view too - it groups emails into a single line and when you tap it, it brings up a list of all emails in the conversation (in preview mode only, it won't display the full emails in the list as the Gmail app would).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A combined inbox is available in the Messaging app. You can hide the social networking stuff if you want to use the combined inbox for serious business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messaging app supports simple gesture actions. You can set an action for left-to-right and right-to-left swipes on emails in the list. Available actions are mark as read/unread, flag/unflag, move or delete. Later, you can view unread only or flagged emails only. Other available views can show you only emails with attachments or sort emails by importance rather than date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the app to show two, three or four lines of preview for each email (the top line is always taken up by the sender so you really get to see one, two or three lines of the email body).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For text input on the Motorola RAZR you get two options - the Swype keyboard (enabled by default) or the standard Motorola QWERTY keyboard. There's handwriting recognition, which is useful for entering Chinese characters. Our RAZR had another keyboard preinstalled, but it didn?t really seem like a viable option - a poorly implemented iOS keyboard lookalike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing is pretty comfortable as the keyboard is multitouch capable and that it's working on a big screen helps out too. You can go to landscape mode if you want it even bigger.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Cool gallery with unacceptable lag when zooming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app is custom-made and looks pretty cool. When you start it up, it uses a virtual pile of your photos for a background. Unfortunately, tapping them does nothing - you have to go into the Camera roll, My library, Online, Friends or MotoCast sub-galleries to access your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, once you go into a sub-gallery, things start to look up. Browsing local galleries is much like the standard experience with pictures are stacked into albums. You can change that view with a different one - Timeline (view photos a day, a week or a month old), by tags or by folder and a really cool option - grouped by the location they were shot in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone in landscape orientation launches a Cover Flow-like 3D landscape mode, with cool looking shadow effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Online and Friends sub-galleries handle online photo albums for you and your friends - Picasa, Facebook, Flickr and Photobucket are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that disappointed us in previous Moto models was zooming - and they haven?t fixed it for the RAZR either. Pinch-zooming is very choppy, unbecoming for a phone with a powerful chipset, and double tap zooms in and out without any animation. At least panning is smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing photos through the RAZR gallery is fairly easy and can be done over Bluetooth, Email, Text messaging and any of the photo-sharing services you have accounts for. You can also set up one of those accounts for Quick upload. The Quick upload option uploads the selected photo to the selected service with a single tap but unfortunately doesn?t work with multiple selected images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also an edit functionality built right into the RAZR gallery - the basic stuff allows you to rotate, crop or tag a photo. Going into the advanced mode gives you one-tap enhancing, effects, brightness and color options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player handles 1080p videos, audio is a problem<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Motorola RAZR is pretty basic - you access the videos through the standard Gallery or Files apps. In the Gallery, it offers the same UI as the gallery and the same 3D landscape view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upside, there's pretty good support for the various video codecs out there - out of the various DivX, XviD, MP4, X264 files we tried only one refused to play. Videos played smoothly and looked great on the qHD SuperAMOLED screen, even 1080p videos. This is where the microHDMI port becomes very useful as the Motorola RAZR can take over as a video player for your HDTV - with some limitations though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options in the video player are limited to scrubbing the clip forward and backward and toggling between the original ratio or a cropped fullscreen version. No brightness settings, subtitles or anything more advanced than simply playing the video is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the biggest issue we found with the player wasn't video codec support - it was the audio codecs that were causing problems. Videos that used AC3 and DTS (the most common audio codecs for HD videos in MKV format) wouldn?t play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, a third party player from the market can solve the issue of missing features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with tons of settings and info<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oddly, our Motorola RAZR came with two apps called Music. The first one had a big Motorola Music logo on it and looked a lot like the image gallery. The available sub-categories here are My library, Podcasts, Internet radio and DLNA servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the My library, you are presented with an interface that works a lot like the phonebook - complete with a quick contacts-like feature. You can view your tracks grouped by artist, album, genre, view all songs or use playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One cool feature that can be accessed from the quick shortcuts is the info screen, which shows you artist bio, related events, photos, music videos, discography and an option to browse similar artists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, when you get into the Now playing interface you can see the album art (with a shortcut for the artist info screen) and you have shortcuts to share the song you're listening to on a social network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a wide array of audio settings available - both for headphones and loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For headphones you get 3D stereo, Home theater, Live Stage or Custom, which includes yet more things like Extreme Bass, Bass punch, Balanced, Brilliant Treble and Vocalizer but no actual custom equalizer settings. You can switch the equalizer off too if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For playing music on the loudspeaker, you get only the Custom equalizer settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player would also automatically fetch lyrics for the currently playing song and display them karaoke style. You can also tap on the two-line lyrics auto queue to view the lyrics for the whole song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second music player is less fancy and uses a tabbed interface - for music, online radio (no FM radio on board the RAZR), music videos, info from TuneWiki and finally, a SoundHound track recognition option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This player also does karaoke lyrics along with a few eye catching tricks like displaying on the world map locations of people listening to the same song. It lacks the powerful equalizer features of the first player though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output ruined by the stereo crosstalk<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were left really puzzled by the Motorola RAZR XT910 performance in our audio quality test. Until the very last reading it was a strong contender for turning out the best musicphone ever. And then came the headphones-on stereo crosstalk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR XT910 did extremely well in the active external amplifier part of the test. One of the loudest smartphones we have seen, the RAZR also got class-leading scores all over the place and perfect frequency response. Update 06 Dec: We were able to obtain another RAZR unit and it turned out that the strange results in the second part of our test we saw were indeed due to some unit specific issues. We've updated the text below, the results table and the frequency response graph, accordingly. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, with headphones attached to it, the RAZR isn't quite as impressive as in the first part of the test, but it still remains a competent performer. Stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortion took the biggest hit, while volume levels went from great to good. Frequency response also worsened a bit, but still remained pleasing. </paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera could use some work<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR is equipped with an 8MP camera that shoots photos with a maximum resolution of 3264x2448 pixels. It's accompanied by a single-LED flash to help out in low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is very simple. On the right side of the viewfinder there's the virtual shutter key flanked by the front/back and photo/video toggles. On the left, there's the gallery shortcut that displays the thumbnail of the last photo taken (with a counter of remaining photos next to it) and the digital zoom slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a retractable row of shortcuts at the bottom - those include effects, scenes, shooting mode, exposure adjustment and flash control (on, off, auto).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From Modes, you can choose single shot, multi-shot (4MP photos), panorama or self timer. Scenes offer things like Sport, Macro or an Auto mode that decides what's best without your explicit input. There's an option to geotag photos - that info can be stripped automatically when sharing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a widescreen option that produces 16:9 photos. With it, both the viewfinder and the gallery images fit the screen aspect perfectly in fullscreen mode. However, the 16:9 aspect ratio means the photos turn out at roughly three quarters of the original resolution at about 6MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you choose the full-res regular 4:3 mode not only does the viewfinder have black bars on the sides but it also crops the outer edges of the actual scene even though those will be included in the final image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR supports touch focus, but you should keep in mind it's a little slow to react - it doesn?t always react to taps and when it does, there's a slight delay sometimes. This happens most often when you tap somewhere and then tap elsewhere before the autofocus has finished adjusting for the first tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR produces fairly crisp photos, but quite grainy at times too, which reduces the fine detail. Scenes that require a high dynamic range will have their highlights and shadows clipped. White balance is spot on although colors are slightly oversaturated.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can check out the Motorola RAZR over at our photo quality compare tool. Just click on one of the images to check out the full page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high-contrast of the first chart are rendered fairly crisp, but you can tell it's been sharpened. The second chart shows just how much the noise and noise reduction take away from detail. There, you can also see how much less defined are the black-on-grey lines. The third chart shows that white balance under artificial lighting is less accurate than in sunlight, with a blue tint appearing.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video capture with issues<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR shoots 1080p videos at 30fps. The user interface looks identical to that of the still camera although some options have been changed. The Scenes option from the still camera has been replaced by Audio Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Stereo, Wind Reduction, Concert, Balanced and Front Facing audio scenes, which use the two microphones to adapt the audio to the specific situation. You still have the effects and exposure options and you can enable video stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera can focus before it starts recording (if you press and hold the virtual shutter) but even then our unit would refocus at the start of the video, which was quite annoying. There's no continuous autofocus to automatically refocus as you move along, but you can tap on the screen to do it manually (note that this isn't touch focus).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in .MP4 files with bitrate hovering at just over 15Mbps. The sound that goes along with the video is stereo (128Kbps bitrate, 44.1kHz sampling rate). Videos are smooth as far as framerate goes but they are noisy and there's noticeable aliasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran into trouble with the exposure - the first videos we shot were badly underexposed, especially in the shade, which covered most of the frame. We shot videos with several other phones in the same lighting conditions and none of them turned out this bad, so we had to take the RAZR back for a reshoot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget to choose 1080p and view the videos in full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched 1080p@30fps video (0:10s, 18.8MB), straight from the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality compare tool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Check out the Motorola RAZR in our video compare tool. You can pit it against other phones in this class to get an idea of where it stands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR turned out to be problematic when shooting videos at close range - in the first setup, the Ferris wheel was out of focus in our first attempt. Anyway, we reshot the scene and the focus was fine. You can see there's a good amount of fine detail visible but you can tell the image has been sharpened. Once the lights go out, the detail (e.g. in the grass) is reduced but the noise stays in check. The third chart shows just how close the RAZR gets to 1080p excellence - not very.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Premium connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR comes with a full connectivity set. It offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band HSDPA potentially reaching speeds of up to 14.4 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity features include dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n (with DLNA support) and Bluetooth 4.0 with LE. The mobile hotspot functionality is enabled on the RAZR too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for wired connectivity, there's a microUSB port and a microHDMI port. Using an appropriate HDMI cable (not included in the retail box), you can hook up the RAZR to an HDTV. The microHDMI port also comes into play with the docks, but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR comes with a MOTOPRINT app that makes it easy to connect to a printer on the local Wi-Fi network and print all sorts of Office docs, PDFs, emails, calendar entries and contact info. All you have to do is find the printer (there is an automatic search, manual search, search in the homegroup and other options).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR can act as a Wi-Fi hotspot too - you can choose the network name (or disable SSID broadcast), choose the security type and password, plus advanced settings like the network channel and DHCP server settings. There's an option that turns off the hotspot functionality after a given period of inactivity to preserve the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola have included an extra application - MotoCast. It allows you to access files stored on your computer (you can choose which folders) over the Internet. That means that everywhere you have a data connection, you can grab a file from your computer. It also allows you to access the files through any web browser by navigating it to MyMotoCast.com. That's a good app for the forgetful type.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Lapdock and HD dock options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The laptop dock for the Motorola Atrix caused a lot of excitement, but now the RAZR is here to top that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lapdock 500 Pro turns the RAZR into a 14" Android running netbook with a full-size QWERTY keyboard and a big touchpad. It features a video call camera above the screen, an Ethernet port (you read that right), a VGA port to connect to projectors, two USB host ports and an SD card slot (that's SD, not microSD).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's not all - the Webtop app provides an interface much better suited to the laptop form-factor than the standard Android UI. It uses windows to make it more familiar, an app shortcut dock at the bottom (a lot like a Mac) and a desktop-grade Firefox browser (not the mobile version).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two more docks - the HD Station and the HD Dock. They both charge your phone, give you a convenient way to hook up external speakers, connect your HDTV (or monitor with a HDMI port) and use the desktop Firefox app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference is that the HD Station also features 3 USB ports, which you can use to hook up a keyboard and mouse and external storage too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great web browser with Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is pretty minimalist - all you have on the screen, apart from the webpage is the address bar, bookmark and share icons. When you scroll down even they disappear, leaving the entire 4.3" screen to the web page (well, almost - the notification area is still visible).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key, six new virtual buttons pop up. You can open a new tab, view bookmarks (this one seems redundant), switch tabs, refresh the page, and go forward. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR supports two zoom methods in the browser: double tap and the multi-touch pinch zooming. Both seem fluid and fast. Text reflow is also available to make sure that text always fits the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports Flash and thanks to all that computing power inside you can even watch embedded 720p videos straight within the web browser. 1080p Flash videos, however, prove too much for it. Anyway, playing Flash games is great too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full organizer suite with Office document editing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most droid siblings, the Motorola RAZR comes with a rich set of organizer features and Moto even threw in a version of Quickoffice that can edit documents too (on most phones, this is a paid upgrade).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice is an excellent app that has support for viewing several file types - Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF. It can also edit and create new .DOC, .XLS and .PPT files (both 2003 and 2007 versions are supported). You have plenty of formatting options, inserting images, Excel formulas and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. You can use the phone calendars or one of your online calendars to schedule events. You can also set multiple alarms to act as a reminder. The calendar integrates with the status bar and also offers pop-up notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is nicely touch optimized ? the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. You can customize the clock used in the Alarm app if you feel like it and there's a built-in timer here too. No stopwatches or world clocks though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a file manager on board as well - it can browse both the internal 16GB memory and the microSD card. Also, there's support for browsing shared folders on the Wi-Fi network you're connected to and also explore computers running MotoCast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a really clever app called Smart Actions - it allows you to create automatic actions triggered by different conditions you set. You can have the phone do various things (e.g. disable background sync, change screen brightness, display a notification to remind you of something, etc.). There are several sample actions that are useful in various situations but you can create your own from scratch too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola's flavor of Android has always been heavy on social networking integration and the RAZR is no exception. We?ve already showed you the social side of the messaging app, the phonebook and gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?re also live widgets with social updates, which you can directly place on your homescreen, to keep you up to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is Social Networking. It can display status updates from all your social networks (or just the ones you pick) and it can be used to set your status on some or all social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there?s the Social Status widget, which lets you post status directly from your homescreen to social networks of your choice. It shows your last posted status update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Social networking app shows you a list of all status updates from all your social networks. You can easily switch to viewing updates from only a single network or only updates posted by you. You can like Facebook posts, retweet tweets and post status updates of your own from this app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another app, called Social location, lets you check into places and view check-ins from your Facebook friends. You can also use the app as a directory of interesting places and events nearby.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR runs a very recent version of Android and with a qHD screen and a powerful chipset, it should be able to handle most apps in there too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and three buttons (Applications, Games and My apps). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps will show you the way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR comes with a GPS receiver and A-GPS technology. It locked to a satellite in about a minute (that's without A-GPS, with it you can get a lock even faster) and had no problems from then on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps (version 5.8 out of the box) is the app of choice and offers the latest touch optimizations like the two finger rotation and tilt, it also features navigation, POI search and much more. 3D buildings are supported too, for the locations where such eye-candy is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the coolest part of Google Maps is the Street View mode. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps comes complete with Navigation, which can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is still limited though (not all countries have the option), and it relies on Internet connection or the uncomfortable map caching (you'll need to go through your entire root to load it up on the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no denying that the Motorola RAZR is a pretty unique handset - from its slim waistline, through the stand-out styling and finish, to hardware specs like a 4.3" qHD SuperAMOLED screen. Considering it?s the spiritual successor to an iconic phone, it seems that Motorola have done their best to brace the RAZR for success.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We quite liked the Kevlar back and the Gorilla Glass coated SuperAMOLED screen is pretty impressive too. But there's a price to pay either way. The battery isn't user replaceable and the PenTile display looks poorly lit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microHDMI port, enabling accessories like the Lapdock 500, sounds really cool, although an HD Station dock next to the TV at home might be a more popular option. And measuring just 7.1mm thick for most of its body gives the RAZR a special feel too. All in all, the cool factor of the Motorola RAZR is off the charts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But cool doesn?t mean practical, let alone best. Here's a list of phones with specs comparable to the RAZR's, which are also competing for a spot in your pocket (and your heart).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II features the same screen size and a standard RGB matrix, which makes up for the lower resolution. The Exynos chipset also pulls ahead of the RAZR's hardware, but there's plain plastic on the back, you need a MHL adapter to use HDMI and it's tangibly thicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Nexus is for those that want SuperAMOLED at a higher resolution - 1280x720 pixels on a 4.65" for a 316ppi pixel density. That one has its own share of downsides though, like non-expandable memory and 5MP camera (which still manages 1080p@30fps videos). The Nexus is impressively slim at 8.9mm and already runs ICS, for which the RAZR will have to wait at least a couple of months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II ? Samsung Galaxy Nexus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're willing to compromise the SuperAMOLED technology for a top-notch headset, the HTC Sensation XE is an option. If you hold it next to the RAZR though, it may look chubby at its 11.3mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL and Titan are a good choice too - barely larger in width and height. They have a 4.7" screen each (though a WVGA LCD). The two measure in at 9.9mm thickness and have metal backs. The Android-running Sensation XL comes with an iBeats headset like the XE, but the Titan runs Windows Phone, which is good news for those tired of Android. You can say goodbye to dual-core CPU, TV-Out and 1080p video with either one of those however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a Samsung S8600 Wave 3 is another non-droid option - with a 4.0" WVGA SuperAMOLED and 9.9mm slim metal body, it's close to what we're looking for, but again not a match for the RAZR in computing power or imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    HTC Sensation XE ? HTC Sensation XL ? HTC Titan ? Samsung S8600 Wave 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola have sure created one impressive, buzzworthy phone. That's not saying that the Motorola RAZR will become a best-seller like its granddaddy but it's the trump card in Moto's deck. The RAZR is a phone to be seen with and a phone to brag about. So, ask yourselves - if a friend showed you the Motorola RAZR, will you be impressed enough to want one too? Most people will, we think. The original RAZR was famous for being famous. The XT910 is a droid, not a celebrity. Though it certainly looks the part.</paragraph>
