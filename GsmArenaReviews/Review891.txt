			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Goodbye Alexander Bell, hello Tim Berners-Lee and Ray Tomlinson. The inventor of the telephone would not have approved of the hulking 6.44" but the Xiaomi Mi Max is the kind of device the pioneers of WWW and email would have loved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mi Max is a phone, sure, a dual-SIM one at that. But with its near tablet size, this device is clearly aimed at digital media and communication.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though Xiaomi has priced it as a mid-fielder, the Mi Max gives a winning first impression. A slender metal body with thin bezels houses a large battery and a capable 16MP/2160p camera. There's a more premium option that offers tons of storage and a faster chipset with more RAM to boot, while still keeping a reasonable price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.5" Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is a well-loved device (with good reason), the Mi Max is the same phone in Hulk mode. Aside from the extra screen size (37% more real estate), it adds 4K video and improves endurance with more storage options and a bigger battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you check the Mi Max page on the Xiaomi website you'll see that just about every blurb starts with "Big screen": play games and watch movies, read books and comics, view documents and web pages. Well, there's one that reads "big screen and big battery" and it is certainly true as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So that's it then - the Xiaomi Mi Max is ideal for multimedia marathons. The size of the screen increases comfort over long periods of time (squinting at "tiny" 5.5" screens can get tiring) and the 4,850mAh battery has more energy than you do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we hope you're well rested because we're diving into the Mi Max.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Special thanks to HonorBuy.com for providing the review unit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Xiaomi Mi Max<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's a big box, but slender. It fits the Xiaomi Mi Max itself and the two vital accessories - a charger (5V @ 2A) and a microUSB cable. There's also an ejector tool tucked into the small manual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't receive a headset and the box doesn't seem designed to fit one either. Still, getting this hardware at this price, we're willing to let it slide.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If this was a movie, the Xiaomi Mi Max could have been seen climbing the Empire State Building with a hot blonde in his paw. Snap back to reality, the phone measures 173.1mm tall and 88.3mm wide, but only just 7.5mm thick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The height and especially the width makes one-handed use pretty much impossible. You can hold it, it's even fairly comfortable, but anything but the most basic actions with the screen requires both hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the weight. At 203g, it's a lot, but given the size, the Mi Max doesn't feel overweight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even with all that, the Mi Max is not the largest phone we've ever seen (even when you skip the voicecall-enabled tablets), but even seasoned phablet users find it gargantuan. So you've been warned. The Mi Max is not a one-handed device and we've made our peace with that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the screen off, the bezel that runs along the screen looks impressively thin. When the screen comes on, however, you see a black double border around the screen, which form a second border.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mi Max is a well-crafted device. The front is Gorilla Glass 4 with a slight bevel at the edge. From here, the transition to the beveled metal sides of the phone is not perfectly smooth, but it offers plenty of grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the back are more rounded, which improves comfort in the hand. There's subtle texture on the back that's just enough to improve traction (as metal phones tend to be slippery).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the big phone is very symmetrical. Around the earpiece are two circles - a 5MP selfie camera on the right and a proximity sensor on the left. The notification light is invisible when it's off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are three capacitive buttons: the App Switcher, Home and Back. Yes, even at this screen size, Xiaomi didn't go for on-screen buttons. This may be a good or a bad thing depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where's the fingerprint button if not part of the Home key? On the back, of course. Even at this size, the round, recessed sensor is easy to reach. It can automatically unlock the phone, so you don't need to use the Power key once you set up a fingerprint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the power key, that's on the right, below the Volume rocker. Both are fairly narrow and have a shallow press. Depending on your grip, it's quite possible to reach them one-handed (yes, even volume up).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side, we find the card tray. You need an ejector tool to access it and you can place up to two cards - two SIMs (nano + micro) or one SIM and a microSD card. It's unusual that the microSD replaces SIM1 (it usually shares a compartment with the second SIM).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi wasn't stingy with storage. The base model gets 32GB, but you can also double it to 64GB. Then there's the top model with 128GB, which also comes with an extra gig of RAM and a faster chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's turn back for a moment. The 16MP camera is almost flush with the back (it doesn't protrude enough to cause a wobble). Next to it is the dual-LED, dual-tone flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the camera/flash pair are on a separate plastic panel (a similar panel is on the bottom). The plastic (a window for the antennas) matches the texture of the metal, though the color is slightly off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the Xiaomi Mi Max are the 3.5mm audio jack, the secondary mic and an IR blaster. At the bottom are a regular microUSB 2.0 port and two grilles. Only one of them hides an actual speaker.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display is the very reason why the Xiaomi Mi Max form factor exists. The most popular size at the moment is 5.5" with a few 5.7-inchers and even some sixers out there. But the Mi Max is a rare breed that pushes the envelope well above the 6" mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6.44" diagonal is the defining feature of the phone and despite its mid-range status, Xiaomi didn't skimp on the quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p resolution is enough to secure a pixel density of 342ppi, which is high enough to qualify as Retina-grade and above. QHD would have been nice, but still, the image is sharp enough even for small, thin type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were worried about the brightness, but as it turns out, it's pretty much par for the course. Compared to some other 6" devices, the only one that stands out is the Galaxy A9 on Auto brightness, where it enjoys a brightness overdrive in extra bright conditions. The AMOLED-packing Oppo R7 Plus, on the other hand, was darker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen's contrast ratio, however, is nothing to write home about, the issue is mostly with the relatively high black levels (even compared to last year's Xperia C5 Ultra). It's by no means bad, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the settings you have the option to boost the contrast of the image if you prefer the punchier look. One mode just boosts the contrast, the other adapts it to the ambient light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here you can also tune the white balance - from Warm through Neutral to Cool. The colors are fairly accurate for this class, an average deltaE of 6.6. That's almost as good as the Huawei Mate 8 and slightly better than the Galaxy A9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the Neutral setting to not quite live up to its name, the white and gray colors have a blue tint. Yet, we found that the color accuracy improves if you push the white balance slider towards Warm. The white balance improves quickly (but magenta goes off).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mi Max has an IPS display and the viewing angles are very good. The sunlight legibility, however, does leave something to be desired. It's better than some popular phones like the Redmi 2 or the OnePlus One, but there are strong performers like the Oppo R7 Plus and its AMOLED screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max is a dual-SIM phone with LTE connectivity. One card is nanoSIM the other micro and the slot is a hybrid solution, which allows you to replace one of the SIM cards with a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since we're reviewing the Chinese model, we also have to mention that there is support for China Unicom LTE and CDMA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Wi-Fi ac with MIMO support, so the phone will benefit from a fast router if you've got one. Bluetooth 4.2 is also available. For positioning, you get GPS, GLONASS and, quite naturally, Beidou.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IR blaster is located at the top of the phone and, coupled with the right software, you can use it to remotely control pretty much any IR controlled home appliance. Xiaomi provides its own MiRemote app, which supports a long list of devices right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port on the bottom is a bit of a surprise, considering Xiaomi has been moving up to Type-C for a while now. Still, the port supports USB On-The-Go if you need to access some external storage or use a USB accessory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The massive 4,850mAh battery of the Xiaomi Mi Max matches its larger-than-life demeanor. With a reasonable screen and chipset, it's set to be a champ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Endurance rating works out to 108 hours, you'd be hard pressed to find a device that lasts longer. Even adding a second SIM doesn't have a huge impact, dropping to 102h Endurance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The individual tests are great too. Talk time is a day, that's 24 hours! The web browsing is particularly impressive at 19 and a half hours, only two phones lasts longer (and they are battery-focused, have 720p screens and lower-end chipset). The video playback is great too, just not quite as amazing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that while the Xiaomi Mi Max does not come bundled with a Quick Charger, it can definitely benefit from a Quick Charge 2.0 or 3.0 power brick. The charger we got in the box was 5V * 2A = 10W, but we got readings as high as 15W with several Quick Chargers we tried (the exact voltage and amps differed, but total power was always 14W-15W). So you can expect a 40%-50% bump in charging speed if you have a more powerful charger at home.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface serves up MIUI Marshmallows<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi advertises the Mi Max as running MIUI 8, but that's still in Beta. Our review unit runs the latest official release, v7.3. It's based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI is one of the most comprehensive customizations of Android. It has a big following in China where Google services are not accessible so Xiaomi refocused the ecosystem away from Mountain View and onto its custom solution. For those living elsewhere, there are ways to sideload the full Google suite if the vendor hasn't done it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is fairly standard (time, notifications, a couple of shortcuts), but once you setup the fingerprint reader you'll rarely see it anyway. Still, the Wallpaper Carousel can put beautiful images on the lockscreen every 15 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint sensor proved quite accurate and can take the phone from sleep to homescreen pretty quickly (the lockscreen is bypassed). It's not as fast as some flagship implementations, but the speed is okay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tap to wake is available but off by default. We turned it on since reaching the Power key on a phone the size of the Mi Max isn't always easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI has a simple philosophy - every shortcut, plus widgets of your choosing are dropped on the homescreen. You get a docked menu for the most commonly used apps and there's a search field in the notification area if you can't remember where you put a rarely used app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two panes. The first shows notifications (and the search field), swipe left and you get the quick toggles and the brightness slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app switcher feels like it came out of iOS 6.0 - apps are represented by their icons, in a single horizontal row. Even on a 6.44" screen, you don't get to see a lot of apps at a time and you don't get to see a preview of the state in which you've left the individual apps. You can pinch zoom to switch to the standard thumbnail card view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are fully supported and several are available out of the box. You can download more, they change wallpapers, lockscreen style, system icons and font, sounds too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max comes in several configurations, we have the base version with Snapdragon 650, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The top model has an S652 chipset and an extra gig of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapdragon 650 has become a very popular choice in the midrange. While it's built on the old 28nm process, the two Cortex-A72 cores offer a lot of speed and the Adreno 510 GPU is fairly capable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the 650 and 652 is the core count - the former has six cores (2x A72 + 4x A53), while the latter has eight adding two extra A72 cores. If budget allows it, the two extra cores are nice to have, but as we're about to see, the base Mi Max is pretty fast to start with (and the GPUs are the same anyway).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>System performance is similar to the Samsung Galaxy A9 (which uses Snapdragon 652). AnTuTu 6.0 thinks the Xiaomi is faster, Basemark OS 2.0 thinks it's the Samsung.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Digging in deeper, we see that the two extra A72 cores do increase multi-core performance, a boost of around 25%. Single-core performance is higher than the Cortex-A57 used in the likes of Nexus 6P.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 510 GPU proves capable of 1080p gaming. The Adreno 405 (used in the Oppo R7 Plus) doesn't really cut it and neither does a Mali with fewer cores (2-core Mali-T760 in the Xperia C5 Ultra). The Huawei Mate 8 with a 4-core Mali-T880 is faster, but the difference isn't huge. The Nexus 6P has a fast GPU (Adreno 430), but its on-screen performance is hampered by its QHD screen (the rest use 1080p).</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max did quite well in the Basemark X tests and came out on par with the Mate 8. Again, notice that the Snapdragon 652 in the Galaxy A9 doesn't have a faster GPU.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X (medium)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Snapdragon 650/652 chipset is a mark of quality for a midrange device. Even the hexa-core processor in the 650 runs modern Android smoothly (the 3GB of RAM weren't an issue either). You might be tempted by the S652 version of the Mi Max, but it's not a must. In either case, the GPU performance is the same and handles games at 1080p easily.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Contacts and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer and phonebook share a single app that also integrates Yellow Pages. The Xiaomi Mi Max is a dual-SIM phone, but you get only one SIM if you need extra storage (you can, of course, buy the 128GB version and use both SIM slots).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi has built in a service to help you keep costs down - Mi Voice. It attempts to dial compatible phones over the Internet, which is great on an unmetered connection (e.g. your home Wi-Fi). The calls themselves are free. Of course, your success rate in using the service will vary depending on how many of your contacts have Mi Voice accounts of their own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the phone to mute the ringer when you lift of flip the phone. You can also mute the first ring of calls from unknown contacts and automatically use an online service that looks up numbers, not in your phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max has a call recording feature, but that one may not be legal in some jurisdictions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max loudspeaker doesn't seem to provide the sound level to match the size of the phone. It scored an Average mark in our dedicated loudness test - it's better than a Huawei Mate 8, but still not as good as other large devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For listening to music, we found the loudspeaker produces a clean sound, but it's lacking in bass.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the dialer, the messaging app has an option to reduce costs - Smart Messages can be sent for free to contacts that also have Smart Messages enabled. Otherwise, the phone falls back to sending regular SMS (basically, it's Xiaomi's iMessage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app itself is pretty streamlined. You can send emoji, multimedia files and canned responses. There's an option to schedule a message if you want to delay it for some reason (works great for text to park).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Xiaomi Mi Max came with the Google Pinyin keyboard, which handles Chinese-language input, but also integrates the Google Keyboard for English. You might want to install the regular Google Keyboard app if you need a language other than English.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the theme of the keyboard, adjust its height, use word suggestion and handwriting recognition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max comes with the Mi App store, but installing Google Play Store (if not already available) is fairly easy. You get a number of Mi apps out of the box, we'll go over a few of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mi Remote uses the IR blaster to control anything from TVs (including the Mi TV, of course) to digital cameras. The setup process is fairly simple and a handy option shares the remotes you've set up with others on the same Wi-Fi network. This means you'd have to go through the setup only once per home assuming everybody else uses a Xiaomi phone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WPS Office is available out of the box if you can't access (or just don't like) Google Drive. Dropbox integration (and 10GB free storage for 3 months) is included into the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Beidou maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Explorer app shows the most recent files you've accessed and has a handy Search function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mi Drop app allows you to quickly share files with other Xiaomi phones. A more compatible way is to turn the phone into an FTP server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Updater app is your way to keep the Mi Max updated and software comes straight from Xiaomi.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max comes with a custom MIUI gallery app. It defaults to showing all photos, but the tabs clearly divide them into three categories - offline (photos on the device), Cloud (Mi Account only) and finally People. This relies on the Mi Cloud face recognition to sort photos by the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor is simple, but capable. The basics (rotation and crops) are covered, as are filters, adjustments and even free-style drawing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music Player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The MIUI music player has a strong focus on music streaming with online charts, online radio and music videos. Track recognition is available too, powered by ACRCloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching over to the My Music tab brings a more familiar experience for playing music that's available on your local storage. The player can display lyrics on your homescreen for a homebrew karaoke experience. Or if you want to let the professionals do it, you can buy tickets for a concert through the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Digging into the sound settings we find a surprisingly rich set of options. You can adjust what headset buttons do and, better yet, load a preset for the type of headphones you're using.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This covers many Xiaomi Mi headphones, but also generic in-ear ones. A 7-band equalizer is available for manual tuning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get access to old school FM Radio too. It doesn't support RDS, but it has goodies like broadcast recording and a sleep timer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player app (Mi Video is another online streaming service), the Gallery app handles things instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is fairly basic but in the settings menu you can control the volume and screen brightness. There's an "enhance audio" toggle and one that controls the aspect ratio.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stellar audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max got perfect scores in the active external amplifier part of our audio quality test. The smartphone's output was clean, while its loudness was up there with the best, making up for one of the best showings out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more impressively, plugging in a pair of headphones causes next to no distortion - outside of a moderate hike in stereo crosstalk there are no affected readings. The volume levels stay high, too, for an impressive showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max comes with a 16MP camera that features phase detection autofocus, f/2.0 lens and sports a dual-LED, dual-tone flash. On the front is a 5MP selfie cam with an 85° f/2.0 lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is a custom MIUI job that splits the task in two - photos and videos - and relies on swipes to simplify some actions. A side swipe can switch between front and back camera, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In photo mode, you can swipe down to access photo filters and up for additional shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We particularly like Straighten. It makes sure the photo you take is always level, you see a preview of how the image will be cropped. Fisheye and Tilt-shift are named after the lenses they imitate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hand-held Twilight mode takes 6 shots at high ISO. The idea is to keep the shutter speed at least 1/30s to avoid motion blur and to reduce the noise (resulting from the high ISO) by combining multiple shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A manual mode is available too, allowing you to change focus, shutter speed, ISO and white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A word on shot to shot time - the camera is fast most of the time, but we had moments where the software felt stuck for a second (happened most often with the selfie camera). It looks like a bug that needs to be ironed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lived up to expectations and can provide detail worthy of the 16MP label. Noise gets stronger in the shadows (which chips away some of the resolved detail), but it's still a very good camera for the class. Color and white balance are on the money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we don't like about the photos is that the sharpening is too strong. We tried playing with the Sharpness setting to see if we can get better photos. The settings range from Lowest (-3) to Highest (+3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lowest sharpness produces photos that are far too soft. You can sharpen them in an image editor later, the detail is there. The option above that, Lower, is more usable, but still a bit soft.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked photos shot on Low, the step below Normal, the best. On Normal mode we start noticing oversharpening halos and artifacts, also noise becomes much more visible. We also tried Higher, the option two steps above Normal and one below Highest. It appears that foliage is more defined, but that's not real detail. Still, we could see some people preferring the Normal option or higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic range can get a little tight, in such situations the camera preserves the shadows at the cost of highlights, shadows remain untouched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is a very good solution to this problem and brings back a lot of detail to bright areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also like that the HDR mode does not mess up the colors or contrast. We did notice a quirk, though - sometimes white pixels appear along edges with high contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selfie camera has a potentially flattering feature that guesses your age and gender and optimizes the beautify mode to match. Call us vain, but we switched both options off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is very good for a 5MP shooter. Images are detailed (if a bit noisy), focus is good, colors are good too. Note that Beautification mode was disabled for these shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panoramas shot with the Mi Max do not have a very high resolution (under 2,000px vertically), but they are sharp and free of stitching artifacts. Even the dynamic range was good, preserving the color of pale buildings (which some cameras render as plain white).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried out the low-light shooting capabilities of the Xiaomi Mi Max, mainly to see how the Handheld Twilight (HHT) mode performs. Since it's similar to HDR in how it works (stacking multiple images), we threw that into the mix as well. HHT's fast shutter speed/high ISO approach works quite well. HDR photos often had camera shake induced blur, while HHT photos did not and were sharp most of the time. They are brighter and sharper than normal-mode images, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max camera impressed outside, here it is in a controlled environment against some of the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Xiaomi Mi Max: photo quality comparison</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi Max can record video at up to 2160p resolution and offers 120fps slow-motion at 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI here is wonky though, to access the 120fps mode you have to manually switch to 720p resolution (otherwise it doesn't show up). When done, you need to disable the 120fps mode, to unhide the higher resolution modes that were disabled in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in standard MP4 files with a healthy bitrate of 42Mbps, though the audio bitrate is stingy - just 96Kbps for stereo audio (48kHz). The video encoder finds it hard to fit in the given bitrate and you can see the quality "oscillation" - it keeps going from detailed to pixelated and then back to detailed again as the amount of the action in the scene changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, videos are sharp and make good use of the 4K resolution. The colors are not quite true to life due to a warm, yellowish tint.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The field of view gets quite narrow compared to what the still camera sees or even what the 1080p camera fits (which comes close to filling the horizontal view of the still camera).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos are shot at 15Mbps and the pulsation is gone. The image has good detail, but looks overprocessed. The yellow tint is still here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The audio sounds okay, but the good work of the mics is marred a bit by the high compression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>2160p videos are rare in this price class, so we used pricier phones for comparison and the Mi Max holds its own.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xiaomi Mi Max key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the largest phones you can buy today, with a battery to match</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Easy enough to hold in one hand, but you'll need two hands for active use</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen gets good marks on image quality, sharpness and brightness, sunlight legibility isn't great</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Amazing battery life with one and two SIMs, 108h/102h Endurance; the web browsing time is particularly impressive, one of the best we've tested</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Customized Android 6.0 Marshmallow looks different but functions the same; the app package is geared towards a Google-free life, but Google services are available if you want them</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Great performance for the class, even for the Snapdragon 650 version; the UI is smooth with 3GB RAM; since the S652 model has the same GPU, so splurging on the S652 chipset and more RAM is mostly for enthusiasts</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudspeaker performance is Average, many 6+ inch phone do better than that</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wired audio is perfect - loud and with very little distortion even with headphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good 16MP camera can benefit from lowering the sharpness setting; Handheld Twilight mode improves low-light performance; Good selfie camera, panorama shows good stitching but resolution could have been higher</paragraph>
			<paragraph>2160p video can use some work (issues with unstable bitrate); FoV narrower than 1080p (no bitrate issues here)</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We live in the digital renaissance where everything can be found online, but our windows to it are tiny - as tiny as the screens of the phones we're holding. There are people in developing markets whose only computer is their phone. From this perspective, you can clearly see there is a market niche for big screen phones. The nice is not necessarily a big one but it's big enough to fit these large-screen monsters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're not into large phones, then we wonder why you even read this far. And if you are, then maybe you still need some convincing that the Mi Max rocks. Let us give it a shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Metal is the material of choice for premium tablets (we're not even looking at phones) and provides the frame to keep that massive shape intact. Xiaomi splurged on a 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 for the front as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen turned out great and its one potential weakness - the 1080p resolution - is a non-issue. The choice of chipsets is solid, but we think the Snapdragon 652 is for enthusiasts only, the 650 is more than capable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has many positive qualities (the addition of 4K video is a great perk) and we think it has the potential to improve with future software updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is as massive as the phone itself and would last you ages. Isn't that the recipe for the ideal "phablet" - a big screen and enough juice for it to stay on for a really long time?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Put your brave faces on, folks, we'll summon the great beasts that are competing against the Xiaomi Mi Max.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>How about the Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra? It has a rare quality - a screen bigger than that of the Mi Max. It's 6.8" big, an IPS unit with 1080p resolution. On the back is an equally impressive 23MP camera, fully loaded with a PDAF-enabled 1/2.6" sensor (1µm pixels), f/2.0 lens with OIS and dual-LED flash. The video recording, however, tops out at 1080p, no 4K here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, a Snapdragon 652 comes as standard and you get Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box. Dual-speakers and a hunky 4,600mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 too (60% charge in 45 minutes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung may be largely responsible for the rise in popularity of large phones, but it's short on 6-plus-inchers. The Samsung Galaxy A9 (2016) is a commendable exception though. It has a metal shell and a 6" Super AMOLED screen of 1080p resolution. It comes with the S652 chipset as standard and is getting updated to Marshmallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is a 13MP shooter that boasts OIS and a bright f/1.9 lens. The 8MP selfie cam has an f/1.9 lens too. You may want to look into the Galaxy A9 Pro (2016) too, it upgrades the main camera to a 16MP sensor. Both versions are capped at 1080p video, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But wait till you hear about the battery! It's 4,000mAh in the A9 and a whopping 5,000mAh in the A9 Pro. Both are quick-charging enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8max may be getting a bit long in the tooth already (no P9max yet, just a 5.5" P9 Plus), but it too boasts a 6.8" 1080p screen. Inside, a Kirin 935 chipset feasts on Marshmallows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is similar to that of the A9, 13MP with OIS and 1080p video. A 4,360mAh battery promises great longevity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R9 Plus is a more affordable alternative to the A9. A metal phone with a 6" 1080p screen, with a 16MP camera (1/2.8" sensor, f/2.0) and 2160p video capture and an impressive 16MP selfie camera (f/2.0). It has an S652 chipset inside running a slightly outdated Android 5.1 Lollipop (heavily customized with Color OS 3.0). The battery has 4,120mAh in its tank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Sony Xperia XA Ultra, also with a 6" 1080p screen. With a fresh Marshmallow inside (though an admittedly less-exciting MediaTek Helio P10 chipset), the phone offers a 21.5MP Sony camera (1/2.4" sensor) with 1080p video and another impressive selfie cam - 16MP (1/2.6") with OIS and its own flash!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2,700mAh battery is the only department where it falls short.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A LeEco Le Max steps up the game with a 6.33" screen of QHD resolution (1,440 x 2,560px). The Snapdragon 810 chipset will not be remembered for its CPU performance, but it does have the GPU to push out QHD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the 21MP camera (f/2.0, 1/2.4") with OIS and 2160p video. The selfie cam pales in comparison, a 4MP unit (f/2.0, 1/3"). So does the 3,400mAh battery by the way. And, be warned that this one may be hard to find in the Western hemisphere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having scanned the competition, what makes the Xiaomi Mi Max a strong proposition is that it delivers where it counts: premium build, good screen and amazing battery. Given a wide enough distribution, it could become a popular choice for those who need every bit of screen real estate.</paragraph>
