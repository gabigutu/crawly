			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Add together the brawn of the Xcover and the brains of a Galaxy S4 and you get the S4 Active. The actual flagship can handle any digital task you throw at it, but the Active version can cope with the grittier side of life. The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is IP67-certified for water and dust protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up to a meter of water for up to 30 minutes - that's the same level of water resistance as the Sony Xperia Z, a phone that often got mentioned for being in the unique position of combining premium features and rugged design. Now it has to share the limelight though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we dive into the specs, we should mention that the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has almost the exact same specs as the regular model, unlike the various Galaxy S minis and such that share in the flagship name to only offer midrange specs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S4 Active at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two downgrades here are the screen (LCD instead of Super AMOLED) and the main camera (down to 8MP from 13MP). The rest is in place though - the blazing fast chipset, the removable battery and expandable storage (two things often sacrificed in the name of water tightness), even things like Air Gestures and the IR remote control functionality are intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, how is the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active better than a regular S4 in a rugged case? It's not that different, though the phone is more compact than a third-party add-on can ever be and we actually quite like the different styling (Samsung's lineup is getting a little stale design-wise).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You're welcome to put on your hiking boots, and hop on for a quick walkthrough of the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active hardware.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9295 Galaxy S4 Active 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has a slightly larger footprint than the regular Galaxy S4, and it's also more than a millimeter thicker and 21g heavier. The extra heft comes from the water-proofing and the different plastic used and certainly adds to the solid feel of the device, but does make the smartphone a bit harder to carry around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Sony Xperia Z, the Galaxy S4 Active has virtually identical footprint and weight, but again, it's notably thicker. Whether or not the added flexibility of a removable battery and a microSD card slot are worth it, is a question everyone should answer for themselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic floor plan of the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is that of the regular Galaxy S4 - the thin bezels around the screen are mostly the same (a hair thicker) - but there are design cues taken from the Xcover phones. The most obvious difference between an Active and a regular Galaxy S4 is the bold Orange color (there are also Urban Grey and Dive Blue versions), which goes well with the Active's adventurous spirit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are the physical buttons on the front (which are more reliable when wet than capacitive buttons) and the new finish on the rear. It's a diamond-patterned plastic not unlike the one of the Xcover phones, plus some screw caps to really drive home the point of it being a rugged device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to say we quite like the Galaxy S4 Activ's looks - it's different from the S III based design that has turned Samsung's lineup into a clone army and we prefer this finish over the hyperglazed plastic of the regular S4. Also, some people just prefer hardware buttons over capacitive keys, especially when the bezels are so thin, increasing the chance of accidental taps on the capacitive controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of handling, the Galaxy S4 Active is roughly similar to the regular S4. The extra thickness and weight are noticeable, but don't impede one-handed operation too badly. It's not as sleek as the Sony Xperia Z, but that one clearly rated elegance higher than rugged appearance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We prefer the patterned plastic on the back of the Active for aesthetic reasons, but practical ones too. That glossy plastic offers little grip as it is, it will be as slippery as an eel when wet (which it better not be as it could damage the internals). The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active offers more grip, wet or dry. We just wish Samsung made the sides of the phone ribbed like the Xcover, which made for a rock solid grip.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active uses a 5" 1080p LCD screen, unlike the Super AMOLED on the regular S4. It has 441 pixels per inch and while it has more sub-pixels per inch (since Super AMOLED uses a PenTile matrix), the perceived sharpness is the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LCD has more tangible advantages - it's brighter, for example. The contrast isn't as great though and the black levels are not very good. There's some slight contrast loss at an angle. It's a minor issue and the screen on the Galaxy S4 is among the better LCDs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the reflectivity is similar to that of the 5" Super AMOLED, meaning the sunlight legibility is slightly better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find all about our display testing routines here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has the exact same set of controls as the regular S4, with the only differences mandated by the water-proof design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three controls below the screen are hardware buttons which, as we already mentioned, are more reliable than capacitive when water is involved. They, along with the Power/Lock key and the volume rocker, have a fine texture, similar to the back pattern, to improve grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key arrangement is still Menu, Home, Back, even though Android deprecated the Menu key and moved its functionality on-screen. Still, it's what you get from every Samsung, so we didn't expect anything to change here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen are the standard proximity and light sensors, but also the exclusive IR motion detector, which is used for Air Gestures (waving your hand above the phone to scroll pages, change music tracks, accept a call and so on). While we're not big fans of this feature, we can see how it makes sense here - it lets you control the Galaxy S4 Active without touching it with mud-covered hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RGB notification LED is also here, along with the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left and right sides of the phone feature the volume rocker and Power/Lock key respectively. The volume rocker can be set to work as a still or video shutter key, which is yet another thing that might come in handy in or around water. It cannot quite replace an actual shutter key, but it's the next best thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB / MHL 2.0 port is at the bottom of the phone and it is sealed with a plastic flap. Right next to it is the mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up top, there's the 3.5mm audio jack which is left exposed. There's a "WATERPROOF" label etched into the plastic if you need extra reassurance. Most water-resistant phones put a flap on the audio jack too, meaning you have to open it every time you want to plug in your headphones (and then remember to close it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary mic and the IR emitter are also here, the emitter is used for remote control functionality in the comfort of your own home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone packs the 8MP camera lens and the LED flash. There's no extra protection offered for the camera, which protrudes slightly, so you should take care not to damage it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is removable, giving you access to the 2,600mAh battery, microSIM and microSD card slots. The back cover doesn't feel particularly solid and has a hollow knock to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is like those city slicker four-by-fours - it can go off-road, but prefers paved streets. We don't think it will take hard knocks and walk away with it, but water shouldn't be a problem. Not that the Sony Xperia Z is much tougher - if nothing else the glass-covered rear means one more panel to scratch or crack.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>New TouchWiz with lots of options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active comes with Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and a laundry list of new TouchWiz features, just like the company's flagship. The Galaxy S4 Active combines the best of both worlds and while it seems familiar, there's plenty new below the surface - so much in fact that you'd need a couple of days just to get accustomed to all the features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the lockscreen, which features the new widgets introduced with Android 4.2, though Samsung fiddled with them a bit. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message overlaid on beautiful photos pulled from TripAdvisor (with text at the bottom about where the photo was taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water ripples have been replaced by a lens flare effect though, if you prefer, you can switch back to the old one or disable it all together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in pure Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the greeting on the lockscreen by hitting the edit button. You can type something else, choose a different font and color. You can also disable the personal message altogether and remove the time and date info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice trick is the Quick glance option we first saw on the Galaxy Note II. It uses the proximity sensor to detect you reaching for the device and it lights up the screen that shows the time, missed call and message counters, battery charge and music track info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there are five (or eight in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. There are more than five toggles, of course, you can swipe horizontally to get to the others. Or you can tap the new button that reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, 20 in total. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can disable this slider to get more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks mostly the same. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub, S Travel, etc. There's wrap around feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button - you can choose a different homescreen as the default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changer really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also maximize space in the app drawer by stacking apps into folders. You can either drag icons on top of each other in edit mode or you can check multiple app via the create folder option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works the same as on a homescreen - it gives you a glance overview of all panes as thumbnails. You can choose to have your app drawer ordering to custom, alphabetical grid or alphabetical list. There's a dedicated downloaded pane too, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can judge how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Active comes with Multi-window. This lets you run two apps side by side on the screen. You can adjust the division line giving one app more space. Only compatible apps can be used with Multi-window, for now that means mostly the ones that come preinstalled on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can move the small arrow that brings up the drawer with the Multi-window apps to make it easier to reach with your thumb. You can also move the whole drawer to the other side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu has been redone in the latest TouchWiz version. Instead of a scrollable grid of icons and sections Samsung has went with a tabbed interface. On top you get four tabs - Connection, My device, Accounts and More. and you can find the relative features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the My device tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes navigating the settings menu much faster and more intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like what Samsung has done with the latest iteration of TouchWiz. Despite pilling feature upon feature, the whole thing really feels intuitive and well organized. Placing widgets, rearranging menu and homescreen panes, getting to your important settings, etc. is now faster than ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also very responsive thanks to the great hardware inside.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Air and Motion gestures, Smart Screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active also offers a number of advanced features enabled by the powerful hardware and dedicated sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is Air View, which debuted on the Galaxy Note II and worked with the S Pen. There's no S Pen on the S4 Active, or a need for it - the phone can detect your finger hovering over the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This enables information preview (e.g. SMS text, calendar entry text and so on), previewing videos just by pointing to a spot in the timeline, the next track in the music player by hovering over the next button (works with previous button too), previewing folders, speed dial contacts, and magnifying links in web pages. Air view detects fingers 1cm / 0.5" away from the screen, so there's no danger of accidentally tapping the screen when you wanted to use Air View instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another set of "air" features are the Air Gestures. Quick Glance is one of them, but there's more. The rest of the air commands are triggered by waving your hand over the Galaxy S4 Activ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use this to scroll web pages in the browser (vertical waves), switch between tabs (horizontal waves), move between tracks in the music player and photos in the gallery, accept a call and move app shortcuts and S Planner events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air Gestures can detect your hand up to 7cm (just under 3") and might prove useful in some situations. Note that only the native apps support them, third party apps will not work with them (even Chrome that comes preinstalled on the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Smart Stay and Smart Rotate features are enabled too. Stay prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face (great for reading) and Rotate uses the orientation of your face rather than accelerometer info to decide how to rotate the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Scroll is one of the two new features - it allows you to scroll up and down by tilting the phone or by tilting your head. It's a bit hard to get it right the first time, but after that you can tilt your head down to scroll down and up to scroll back up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second new feature is simpler and more useful - Smart Pause. While watching a video, it uses the front-facing camera to track your face and will automatically pause the video when you look away. Look back and the screen and the playback continues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are a number of motion gestures, which are not exactly new. There's direct call (dial the contact whose info you're currently viewing by lifting the phone up to your ear), smart alert (makes the phone vibrate when you pick it up if there are missed events), zooming and panning in the gallery, a shake of the phone to refresh the list of Bluetooth devices and muting alarms or pausing music playback by putting the phone face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pause the music player by putting your palm on the screen. A palm swipe takes a screenshot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and is present on the Galaxy S4 Active. S Voice can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual phone and it has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy S4 Active to answer a call, snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The problem with S Voice is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, being a Jelly Bean smartphone, the Galaxy S4 Active also comes with Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, gives you the weather forecast for your city and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget on the homescreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active has an 8MP camera, which is borrowed from the Galaxy S III rather than Galaxy S4. It captures photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixels. There's a 1.9MP camera on the front, but there's no dual-shot mode like on the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is based on the Galaxy Camera interface. A virtual shutter key and a capture video button are always available in the viewfinder, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution as, if you're shooting full resolution 8MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mode button brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each mode comes with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops the descriptions but is faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more settings in the top left corner, but they won't be used very often. Still, there're a number of interesting options here like the setting for the volume rocker to act as a still shutter key, a video shutter key or a zoom lever. Another interesting option is contextual file names - the Galaxy S4 Active will name photos with your location (the GPS needs to be on for this to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can customize the shortcuts available here, but most people will probably stick to the Mode selector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are relatively few manual settings, the Galaxy S4 Active just gives you an ISO setting, white balance and exposure compensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go over the different modes. The Aqua mode is unique to the rugged phones in the Galaxy lineup and optimizes camera settings for underwater shooting. Be sure the set the volume rocker as camera shutter key instead of trying to use the touchscreen underwater.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are standard modes like Rich Tone (HDR), Panorama, Night and Sports. Panoramas are not as impressive as on the Galaxy S4 - they come out with about 1200px vertical resolution (lower if you don't hold the phone steady).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes we've seen on previous Samsung phones like Best Photo and Best Face, which snap multiple photos and let you pick the best one (in the case of Best Face, you can tweak each face in the photo individually). Beauty Shot does some automatic touch up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we get into the more interesting shots. Eraser helps you remove moving objects (e.g. passers by walking into your shot). Drama mode takes a moving object and clones it several times. Note that the resolution for this mode drops to 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound &amp; shot captures a photo and records ambient sound. It sounds pretty cool - for example, you can hear the sea gulls in a beach photo or the roaring of car engines at a race - but we had problems sharing the shot, all the Galaxy S4 Active would send is the still image, a JPEG and no sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cine photo feature has been renamed Animated photo and records several seconds of footage and then creates a looped GIF. You can trim the animation and control how it is looped. Here's a sample of what that looks like (size warning: this GIF alone is over 20MB, a 1080p video clip of the same will be smaller).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, Samsung has copied most of the features of the Galaxy S4 camera, but left out some of the premium options - the 360 photo (Photo Sphere) is missing and there's no dual-shot or color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll reserve image quality discussions for the review, until then here are a few samples.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active features a wide array of advanced features and applications that really make it stand apart from other flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the coolest apps is called Group Play. It shares various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room, but unlike DLNA it's interactive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One use case is to play a music track on the Galaxy S4 Active and use multiple phones as speakers. You can pick the role of each phone (e.g. left channel, right) all the way up to surround sound. This way you can control the music from one phone but use the loudspeakers of all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the other phones will need to support Group Play - the phones communicate over Wi-Fi (your Galaxy S4 Active becomes a hotspot that others connect to) and the pairing is done via NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More useful are the options to share a picture or a document - you can have the same picture appear on everyone's phone and you can draw over it if you need to highlight a certain element of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, perhaps the coolest feature of Group Play is that it allows for multiplayer games to be played on several phones simultaneously. Of course, only supported games work - there was a poker and puzzle games preloaded on our unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Samsung Link, another way to share content between devices. Unlike Group Play, Samsung Link is intended for personal use. You can link the phone to a computer that is synced with Dropbox, SkyDrive or SugarSync and remotely access content on that device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator will help travelers - it can translate between two languages using either typed text or by using speech recognition. It can read out the resulting translation too, if you don't think your Korean accent can cut it. S Translator supports all the widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and, of course, Korean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung WatchON is the primary app used with the built-in IR emitter on the top of the phone. The app starts out by asking your zip code and pulls up a number of TV service providers in that area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is so that the app can show you a TV guide with shows currently on or upcoming on the channels offered by the service provider. You can read a description of the show, check out its popularity in up/down votes (and vote yourself, of course) and comments. You can also set reminders for shows you want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the key element of the app is the IR remote control functionality. The app can control TVs, DVD and Blu-ray players, streaming media players and air conditioners. Devices are organized by rooms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really liked about the app is that it knows some home setups are messy - some let you change channels with the TV remote, others require you to use the set-top box remote for that. Same for the audio, you might be using the TV to output the sound or an AV receiver. The app will ask about your setup and present a unified remote control interface even if you have multiple hardware remotes to control all the devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, S Health is Samsung's home-brewed health and fitness tracking application. It starts off by getting you to create a profile which includes all your vital statistics, such as age/weight/gender and level of activity, plus your calorie consumption goals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides a pleasant interface which gives you an at-a-glance look at your progress, as well as walking, exercise, and fitness trackers. S Health also supports a number of optional accessories, which enables it to give even more detailed info on your status. This includes scales that wirelessly transfer their measurements to the phone, where you can see a graph of how you're doing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use S Health to track what you've eaten for the day and how many calories you've burned during exercise (with many different types of exercises supported). It also measures your comfort level by keeping track of the temperature and humidity around you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impression<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There already are water-resistant cases for the Samsung Galaxy S4, so for under $40 you can obtain the one true advantage the S4 Active has over the S4. So why would anyone buy the S4 Active when it doesn't have a Super AMOLED screen or a 13MP camera?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9295 Galaxy S4 Active &#x2022; Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one, those cases usually add a lot of thickness - 16-20mm total is typical. They are usually not the most attractive things, while the Galaxy S4 Active is arguably prettier than the regular S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-hand feel of the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is quite different to that of the original Samsung 2013 flagship and the grip the IP67-certified new recruit provides is certainly superior. We can probably live with the extra weight and while the added thickness is noticeable on a phone this size, pocketability isn't really affected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More significantly, though, some hardware features have been changed. The Samsung Galaxy S4 Active is mostly identical to the regular Galaxy S4, aside from two major components.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung obviously wanted to keep all available 13MP camera units for the flagship Galaxy S4 (it couldn't secure enough 13MP sensors for the Galaxy S III, which is why the former flagship used an 8MP camera). The Galaxy S4 Active also uses an 8MP camera, but that still turned out to be a quality shooter and it's spiced with quite a few new software goodies that the new chipset allows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is another matter - we're fans of AMOLED and the one on the Galaxy S4 is the best ever, but the LCD on the S4 Active is pretty good itself. It will also change the battery life (we expect improved web browsing longevity), but we'll wait until the review to do a proper battery test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end, the Samsung Galaxy S4 Active looks like a niche device - most people looking for a Galaxy S flagship will end up with a regular S4 in their pocket. But as the Sony Xperia Z demonstrated, there's a market for water-resistant phone with high-end specs. Especially if the S4 Active is priced right - a step below the regular S4 would make sense to compensate for the two key downgrades.</paragraph>
