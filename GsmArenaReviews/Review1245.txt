			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Do we cancel the show if the star is not available? This one must've crossed some minds over at Sony Ericsson when the Xperia Neo had to be discontinued. But no, they didn't cancel it. The crew was told to take five instead while they skimmed the B-list for a possible substitute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo V is not an upgrade of the original Neo. It?s actually a downgrade forced by circumstances. The only difference is the camera sensor - down from 8 to 5 megapixels - and the more recent Android version. Sounds so little, doesn't it? That's the price for saving the Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The deadly Japan earthquake took lives and brought the local electronics industry to a halt. Sony was affected too and, with a shortage of 8 megapixel camera sensors looming, someone had to take the hit. That someone was the Xperia neo. This is the story told by a company insider, who we have no reason to doubt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the same phone, different camera and the lower price makes sense. And it should be clear by now the V is the Roman numeral for five, not a letter. Could there be a victory sign anywhere in the picture?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Xperia Neo lives inside the Neo V. Patched up with band aid and mildly myopic but sill. The potential deal-breakers are identical, so if you had second thoughts about the original, you'll probably pass on this one too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you meet the Neo for the first time you are welcome to join us as we explore the hardware and build. Let's see if Sony Ericsson play a bad card poorly or make the most out of a situation they never meant to be in.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V comes in a compact box accommodating the handset itself and the usual set of accessories. Those include a USB charger, a microUSB-to-USB cable (used for both charging and data connections) and a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are a couple of user guides and a 2GB microSD card in the box. The original Neo came with 8GB worth of extra storage. Someone at Sony Ericsson must've thought 5-megapixel photos didn't take so much space. Or they just pressed the downgrade button all the way down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An HDMI cable is missing ? the microHDMI to HDMI kind isn't so widespread and you might not have one at hand. At least, the original Neo didn't have one either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V is a complete clone of the original. It stands at 116 x 57 x 13 mm and weighs 126 grams. Thanks to the "human curvature" design the phone looks slimmer than the numbers will tell you. We like the digicam-inspired design, the slightly raised shutter key and the centrally placed lens at the back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V makes no changes to the original design. With the assembly line on standby, the goal was obviously to resume production ASAP. The styling keeps much of the Vivaz - we hope you remember the old Symbian bloke. The Neo is the spiritual heir of the HD cameraphone and now the legacy is handed down to the next generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body of the neo V is entirely made of plastic but that?s not necessarily a bad thing. The shape and weight are just right and the phone is well put together. The obvious downside is the glossy plastic gets covered with smudges in no time and they are hard to clean up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the phone?s front is taken by a 3.7" 16M-color LCD screen with resolution of 854 x 480 pixels. The neo V uses the same Reality display as many of its Xperia line siblings, based on the Sony Bravia Mobile Engine. The high-quality LED-backlit LCD has pleasing colors; contrast and sunlight legibility are good too. The questionable feature is viewing angles: contrast quickly deteriorates and the colors get washed out when looking at the screen at an angle. This won?t be a problem though for those who would trade comfort for privacy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the Reality display is no match for the Samsung?s SuperAMOLED or even IPS LCDs, we still think it?s on the better side of LCDs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's our proprietary display test. On the Xperia neo V, we were only able to do our display test with the screen brightness set to the maximum, as once you select anything other the maximum setting the light sensor kicks in and starts automatically controlling the screen brightness. And since we conduct our test in a completely dark room that would lead to inaccurate results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen we find the usual set of controls: hardware Back and Menu buttons, each side of a Home key. The controls are thin but with good solid press press and, being placed on a subtle chin, they are quite comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s pretty crowded above the display: there?s an earpiece, ambient light sensor, the secondary VGA camera and a proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left hand side of the Xperia neo V is completely bare, while the right gets all the action. That?s where you have the volume controls and two small knobs: the power/lock button and the shutter key. The camera button is tiny but pleasingly tactile. It's placed on a subtle bulge whose raised rims are easy to locate by touch. Not a big deal but quite thoughtful of Sony Ericsson. There?s a tiny status LED next to the power/lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s busy at the top too ? there we find the microUSB and microHDMI ports on each side of a 3.5mm audio jack. Both the USB and HDMI ports are covered by small plastic lids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Sony Ericsson neo V is rather interesting - just like on the Vivaz and the neo, the 5MP lens is unusually placed almost in the middle. It makes sense though ? the lens is nearly impossible to accidentally cover with a finger. The lens is recessed to ensure protection against scratches and smudges. Next to it, there is a LED flash, which is mostly useful as a video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is all the way at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the battery cover, though not beneath the battery itself and is therefore hot-swappable. The Neo supports 32GB cards and comes with a complimentary 2GB card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card compartment is under the 1500mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V is quite reasonably sized and no hassle to carry around or put into pockets. The 3.7? reality display is on the better part of LCDs. The Neo V is well-built and there is nothing to complain about other than the fingerprint issues. The handset feels solid and is quite comfortable to hold and operate. A few months late to the show and a forced substitution at that, the neo V falls in a lower price bracket. It doesn't look or feel cheap though. The only compromise for users to consider is the lower-spec'd still camera.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android 2.3.4 lands on the Neo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V runs the latest Gingerbread version 2.3.4 of Android. It is already available for the entire Xperia 2011 lineup, including the first Neo - or what's left of it in stores. Let's once again go over the new stuff in the latest Gingerbread release:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a video demo of the user interface too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the Xperia neo V has a five pane homescreen (you can't add or delete panes), with four docked shortcuts (two on either side of the launcher shortcut). Those are visible on all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen also does a neat trick called Overview mode. Pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition. All your widgets gather there and you can click the one you want and go to its screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of functionality, it?s similar to the HTC Leap view or what Samsung do in TouchWiz. However widgets here are not crammed in small hard-to-read screens. Instead, they?re all shuffled on a single screen, so they can better use the space and remain as big as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo V has some custom-made Sony Ericsson widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, the standard gallery is back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher puts shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort your icons within the grid. You can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually shuffle the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is simple, using the iOS logic (and visual layout). You drag one icon over another and a pop-up prompts you to select an icon and a name for the folder you?re about to set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is standard Xperia fare. Which means you get notifications for Facebook events too. The standard notification area and task switcher are of course present and accounted for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing worth mentioning - the Take Screenshot shortcut. It's found in the power settings and you need to press and hold on the Power/Lock key to access it. It would have been better if Sony Ericsson has made it with a combination of two keys (like the iOS's Home+Lock combo) rather than a virtual shortcut, but at least it's there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon chipset has been around for a while and we know what to expect from it in terms of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson already used this chipset in most of its latest smartphones. As we suspected the Xperia neo V showed similar results on the synthetic benchmarks as the Xperia ray and lower than the Sensation XL's results.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>We really like this phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo V visually customized phonebook can store extensive information about all your contacts. Info for each contact is presented in side-swipable interface that holds contact info, recent calls and more info from social networking services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options ? a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts, or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can ?join? their contact info to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled ? a tap on the contact?s photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the plus and X buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write down the name phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Personalized ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No smart dialing for the telephony, in case you care<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo V held on to signal well and we didn?t experience dropped calls. Reception levels are good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo V as every other Xperia phone does not support smart dialing. There?s voice dialing though (the quickest way to activate it is the dedicated homescreen widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V automatically disables the touchscreen when you hold it next to your ear during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V. Scoring a Below Average result, the neo V isn't the loudest ringer around, so you might occasionally miss a call. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hidden in the Sound settings is xLOUD, a feature that claims to improve speaker loudness. A quick test shows deeper sound, but we also used our digital noise/loudness meter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>xLOUD made a difference of about 10dB when you sum up the tests, pushing the score to an Average mark, but it's still a minor gap to made a noticeable difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads. Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (against deletion).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use search to locate a specific message in all conversations. You can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there?s no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email app can do that however. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A preview pane splits the screen in half - one side lists the emails, while the other shows the currently selected email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This works both in portrait and landscape and you can easily drag the separator between the two areas to make one bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the neo V offers a just the default (Gingerbread) on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Even on the portrait keyboard, typing is pretty comfortable, keys are large enough and well spaced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape however tells a whole new story. The large on-screen keyboard takes more than half the screen and gives you large, easy to press buttons. The neo V is probably as good as you will ever need ? in virtual keyboard terms of course. For proper typing, you should consider a QWERTY messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a ?handle? attached to the text cursor ? it?s easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A tap and hold will bring up the select options ? select word and select all ? with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection. Another tap and hold brings up the copy/cut options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now about the T9 Trace swipe input. It works the same way as the Swype we already met in lots of Galaxy phones - instead of tapping on keys you sweep a finger across the keyboard. Even if you never used Swype input before, you'll get used to it fast and embrace it. There is also setting for automatically put Space between the words, so you don't need to every time you "swipe" a word.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, why not Swype, but swipe or trace. It works the same way both in usability and precision, so you shouldn't really care about the name.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android-ish gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo V uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn?t really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should have noticed the 3D switch by now at the top. It opens a different gallery section that stores only your 3D panorama shots. The standard camera photos and panoramas are in the familiar camera folder in the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To view the 3D panoramas, you need to connect your phone to a compatible 3DTV. We tried them on the LG Optimus 3D, but the device couldn?t recognize them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has added support for Facebook albums too. They are distinguished by the small Facebook logo on them and when viewing individual pics from that album, you can "like" them with the thumbs up button in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Thanks to the Xperia neo V multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS also comes in handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors, as it sharpens the image and reduces noise. These steps would normally lead to artifacts, but the high-density screen of the Xperia neo V makes them invisible. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend you keep it on - it really improves the image quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor video codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Xperia neo V as in most of the droids out there. Fair enough, maybe a fancy UI for picking a video is not that important, playing videos is what really counts. Well, that?s another disappointment ? the video player supports only 3GP and MP4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To its credit, the Xperia neo V did play a 720p MP4 video (but not 1080p). And the 3.7? FWVGA Reality screen offers excellent image quality (the BRAVIA engine comes into play here too) and spot-on aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you re-encode your videos beforehand, the Xperia neo V can make a good PMP. Or you could just download a capable video player off the Android Market and make your life easier. This would address other deficiencies of the Xperia neo V video player, like lack of subtitles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player welcomes Facebook likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Xperia neo V is the same app you get in the arc S, ray and the Xperia neo. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you?ll get a search shortcut, as well as send and delete options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library and the Infinite key. The latter lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the rich selection of equalizer presets. You also get Silent mode, which mutes all other sounds except for alarms - great for uninterrupted listening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Gallery, the Music player on the Xperia neo V lets you "like" tracks you're listening to, which posts it on your wall. Later on, you can discuss them with your friends through the Friends' music and videos app (sometimes called Media discovery). There's a widget too, so you can always be up to date with what you're friends are listening to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS, TrackID ids here too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station. Or you can mark some of them as favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service is also available and works within the radio app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is nicely loud and pretty clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V did marvelously in the first part of our traditional audio quality test. The smartphone got very good scores all over and garnished them with above average volume levels, making up for one of the better performances we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, things aren't as rosy when you plug in a pair of headphones as the stereo crosstalk raises quite a lot and some distortion creeps in. Volume levels also drop in this scenario so the overall performance is not quite as impressive as in the first test. It's not too bad, but audiophiles with high standard might not be completely satisfied.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The camera loses the ExmorR sensor, now offers 5 megapixel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The major change on the neo V, as we discussed in our introduction, is the camera department. Unfortunately the neo has lost the ExmorR sensor and a few megapixels. It now features a 5 megapixel snapper and a single-LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera controls on the Xperia neo V are familiar - they are available on two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. The left one holds five shortcuts to various settings, while the right one shows thumbnails of the five most recent photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pull to expand the settings taskbars or push them out of sight. It?s a clever solution that lets you pick how much of the camera controls are seen in the viewfinder. The shortcuts in the left column can be rearranged and you can replace some of them with others from the extended menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between five capture modes - Normal, Scene recognition, Smile detection, Sweep Panorama and 3D Sweep Panorama. In Normal, you pick the Scene settings manually or you can enable Scene recognition and let the Xperia neo V take a guess (it's fairly good at it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two panorama modes are the additions brought by the Android 2.3.4. The Sweep Panorama option is available in lots of Sony portable cameras, so it should be familiar to some of you. Anyway, it?s very easy to take a panorama - you just follow an on-screen slider until you reach the end and your panorama shot is taken. Unfortunately, you can't choose how long it will be, you have to shoot it until the slider run out. If you are too slow or too fast you'll have to start over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on which panorama mode you have chosen, you will be able either to view your 2D shot (4912x1080 pixels) on your neo V or take it on a 3D TV and see it there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other settings include changing the resolution, toggling between front/back camera, photo light (but it's switched manually, not automatically as a flash), geotagging, image stabilization and focus mode. Also at your disposal are a self-timer, shutter sound, exposure, white balance and metering settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is good, but it could have been better. The colors and the contrast are good too, while the amount of captured detail is just average. Noise levels are kept relatively low but there is some color noise. Photos have good contrast and good (though slightly oversaturated) colors. Some over sharpening is evident in high-contrast areas, but nothing drastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few samples we took with the neo V.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama shots are captured with 4912x1080 pixels resolution and if you take them with a tripod they will be assembled perfectly. If not, you'll be surprised to out the pictures are almost as good as tripod enhanced ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pano shots quality is the same as the standard ones - lack of detail, but other than that satisfying contrast and colors. Forgive the weather around though, the combination of close sunlight, low clouds and mist isn?t the best scene for a smartphone to shine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V to our Photo Compare database. The tool?s page has a quick how to guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly the neo V performed very well on all the three charts, producing enough amount of detail (although we still can tell other Xperia phones do better) and pleasant colors. We saw some fringing in high-contrast areas again.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smooth 720p video recording, average quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V captures 720p video at 30 fps. The camcorder has similar settings to the still camera - focus mode, metering, exposure value and image stabilization are all user-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neo V camcorder joins the select few with continuous autofocus. It may take a few seconds to refocus after you re-frame but that's better than repeating attempts to lock focus that may ruin a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 format (6Mbps bitrate) and the frame rate nails the 30fps mark. The amount of captured detail is average though, but the colors and contrast are good. The amount of detail drops a bit in the dark as noise reduction fights to keep videos mostly noise free. Some extreme over sharpening is present in some scenes too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neo V videos come with stereo sound recorded at 128Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p samples that we captured with the Xperia neo V:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download this untouched sample 720p@30fps, taken straight off the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 720p mobile camcorders. The results are a mixed-bag and you can easily find a lot better HD camcorders (Xperia smartphones included). It seems the video recording, although smooth, is not one of the neo V's strong sides.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V has a good deal of connectivity options. The basics are covered by quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload at 5.76 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n) and Bluetooth 2.1 for wireless local connectivity. The Connected devices app turns your Xperia neo V into a DLNA server, letting you view media on DLNA-enabled devices (e.g. TV, PlayStation 3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB v2.0 port handles both wired data transfer and charging. With the Android 2.3.4 Xperia neo V supports USB on-the-go, but you have to buy the Sony Ericsson Live Dock to be able to use it. When you get the accessory, you can connect wired and wireless USB accessories such as keyboard, mouse and gamepads to your phone. Unfortunately USB drives are not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LiveWare manager app lets you assign specific apps to be launched when a given accessory is connected, which can be quite handy (e.g. launch music player when you plug in headphones or a file browser for flash memory).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inbuilt storage has 200MB only available to the user, but you can expand it up to 32GB via the microSD card slot. The phone ships with a 2GB memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A standard 3.5mm audio jack and a micro HDMI port complete the connectivity tally. There is no micro HDMI cable included in the retail box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser is simple, with almost no visible chrome by default. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way you have the entire 3.7? screen for web browsing. The neo V browser supports double tap and pinch zooming, along with the dedicated virtual zoom buttons. There's text reflow, which reformats text so that it best fits on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsing performance is excellent - panning, zooming and the text reflow are blazing fast. The neo V web browser is an example of how a mobile browser should look and behave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the important features in the web browser is the full Flash 11 support. YouTube videos played smoothly at 360p and 480p, while the 720p ones got quite choppy. Flash games played trouble free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer. The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable on the high-resolution screen and panning is blazing fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with both Gmail and the generic email app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. The generic Email app even lets you download the attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for Agenda: a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Events appear just like regular events but you can't edit them from the phone, they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can pull out advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms) from the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you don?t have the Stopwatch, Timer or World Clock options. You don?t get a Voice Recorder either. There's plenty of those in the Android Market though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and trial Wisepilot navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia neo V comes with a GPS receiver, which took less than 3 and a half minutes to get satellite lock from a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks or the network positioning if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our unit came with Maps 6.0.2 out of the box, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without a connection though. There are also 3D buildings, two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, those features aren?t available everywhere. 3D buildings are available mostly in the biggest world cities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street view is, as usual, a part of the standard package - it gives you a panoramic view of every bit of road in the covered areas. With the compass mode enabled, it feels like a virtual tour of the place!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Xperia neo V came with Wisepilot pre-installed with 30 days trial navigation license. It took it really long to get a GPS lock with every GPS setting turned on, but then it does what a SatNav software is supposed to - navigate (with voice guidance). There are weather and traffic information too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market gets better and better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia neo V runs the latest version of Android and has a FWVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market. The MSM8255 chipset should be able to handle most apps in there too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market had another visual boost lately plus a layout redesign. Now you get a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. This organization reminds a lot of the Apple's App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-app section is untouched though and we still find it quite unattractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A downgrade. A B-lister. You can go ahead and call it what you want. The Neo V is the only kind of damage control SE could do in the aftermath of the dramatic events in Japan that held hostage half the mobile industry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The time was up for the Neo - and quite unexpectedly too. The Neo V was called in as an emergency replacement and no one expected miracles of it. Especially since the very essence of the original Neo was the cameraphone experience, which is exactly what got downgraded this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the Neo V is not the cameraphone the Neo was meant to be. And it?s not only the lower resolution stills. The 720p videos are not quite up to scratch either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in the process of replacing the Neo, Sony Ericsson had to redefine the whole idea behind it. In the end, we received a convincing midrange smartphone that shares some of the premium features of the company's flagship ? at a much more affordable price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Neo V is a 1GHz-powered smartphone with a 3.7" screen, 5MP still camera and HD video. Guess what - this could nearly describe half the droids out there. Plenty of competition, not to mention it?s right on par with what Windows Phones currently offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia ray is perilously close price-wise. And it?s a tempting deal. Not because of the better camera but because it's got a slimmer profile and genuinely more character. Then again - a bigger screen is definitely an asset. The Neo V's 3.7-incher beats the Ray and its 3.3" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Xperia ray</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus Black sounds quite tempting too - it has a bigger 4" NOVA display, and similar 5 megapixel camera and hardware platform. The Optimus Black costs almost the same as the neo V, so it is an excellent option if you are into big screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus Black P970</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, in the end. The neo is dead. Long live, neo V? Not quite. More like - one goes down, another takes its place. The Neo V got no choice - but maybe has some future. As long as it chooses wisely what it wants to be. A cameraphone may be a long shot, but a decent smartphone ? it?s quite achievable.</paragraph>
