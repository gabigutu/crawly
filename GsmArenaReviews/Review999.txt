			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, this sounds like an apt title really. The Sony Xperia E is among the cheapest packages on offer from Sony, second to only the Tipo. From the design theme of the first generation of Sony smartphones, to the familiar internals, the Sony Xperia E has little to no surprises. Especially that we've actually seen its twin already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E and Xperia E dual are nearly identical, with the number of SIM slots the only notable hardware difference. It boils down to what makes more sense to you as a user - dual-SIM support or the more recent Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When talking entry-level smartphones, a single-SIM package usually has to try harder to make itself noticed. Dual-SIM versions are usually regarded as niche devices but they have the benefit of a clearly defined target audience. There's a lot of competition in Sony Xperia E's price bracket, and not just droids either. Yet, Jelly Bean right out of the box gives it a good enough start. Let's take a closer look at what else it has to offer:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E is yet another Qualcomm-powered 3.5-incher for Sony in the entry level market. It's got the upper hand over the likes of the Tipo and Miro (clocked at 800MHz), and probably even the Xperia J which is has the exact same 1GHz chipset but a bigger and more pixel-rich FWVGA screen. Bottom line, no record-breaking speed is to be expected here but the Xperia E will most likely get the job done for first-time smartphone users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the main thing to try and find out here is whether a reasonably good-looking basic smartphone will prove an equally reasonable performer. As usual, we'll start with our traditional hardware overview right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Xperia E<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Xperia E has nothing but the basics - an AC adapter, a USB cable for both data connections and charging, and a single-piece headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia E 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E is absolutely identical in shape and size to its dual-SIM counterpart, coming in at 113.5 x 61.8 x 11 mm and weighing 115 grams. It's very compact and lightweight and is one of the easiest smartphones to handle and pocket we have seen recently.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E uses the design theme of the previous generation of Sony smartphones, the subtle inward curve of the battery cover reminiscent of the Xperia J and, more flatteringly, the ex-flagship Xperia T. The curvature is a lot less prominent of course in the Xperia E, which is the shortest and chubbiest phone of the three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike most of the 2012 Xperia smartphones that came with flat matt-plastic battery covers, the Xperia E employs a textured rubberized finish that's almost fingerprint-proof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What will get smudgy all the time is the screen glass and the glossy black bezel. Keeping the front clean is a tough job too - a microfiber cloth will do the job, but it won't be long before it's required once again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E has no fancy finish, but looks better built than most in its price range. The plastic used feels both adequately sturdy and nice to the touch. The Xperia E's rubery back provides excellent grip and the smartphone handles really comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony did an excellent job of putting the Xperia E together too. There are no squeaks or creeks and the gaps between the panels aren't too wide either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls and SIM beds<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Most of the Xperia E front is occupied by the 3.5-inch TFT HVGA display. Just above the screen is the centered earpiece, the hidden status LED, and the proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen we find the capacitive Back, Home and Menu keys, which. They are haptic enabled and producing short sharp vibrations upon a tap. They light up briefly as you unlock the screen, but the backlighting is otherwise off until you tap on one of them. There's no setting to change this behavior and the lack of an ambient light sensor means they won't illuminate automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a microphone pinhole just below the Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exposed microUSB port is near the top on the left side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Xperia E is pretty crowded, accommodating all three hardware buttons. From top to bottom we find a thin volume rocker, a tiny but prominent metal knob for Power on/off and screen lock, and the camera shutter at the bottom. A dedicated camera key on a budget phone with a fixed-focus camera borders on nonsense, especially considering that it doesn't even override the screen lock to launch the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the hndset, the 3.5mm audio jack is the only thing of note. While at first glance the bottom appears bare, there's actually a hidden breathing LED right where the chrome frame meets the sloping bottom edge of the front. It glows for a few seconds each time you unlock your Xperia E, matching the currently selected color theme. The tiny status LED next to the earpiece is in charge of notifications (messages, battery status, missed call etc).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the right bottom corner you can find a lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Xperia E has the 3.1MP camera lens and the loudspeaker grille just between the removable battery cover and the soldered plastic at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you slide up to release the battery cover, you'll get to the hot-swappable microSD card slot and the 1530mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E is powered by a 1530mAh battery, which we are still putting through our usual test routine. Check back with us tomorrow for the results.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HVGA display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E comes with an HVGA LCD screen, measuring 3.5 inches in diagonal. 320 x 480 pixels and 165ppi density sounds pretty poor for a smartphone these days, but you'll need to search really hard to find better in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for image quality, the Xperia E's display offers fairly low contrast, poor viewing angles and sunlight legibility. Sadly, a mediocre screen is still one of the things you have to live with if you shop smartphones at rock bottom prices. Here are the results from our traditional display tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you'll notice, we got some slightly different results when compared to the Xperia E dual - this is likely due to Sony using more than one panel manufacturer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Jelly Bean does it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E runs Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean out of box. Like we said in the intro, the dual-SIM variant of the Xperia E runs Ice Cream Sandwich, so from a software standpoint, you're getting a bit more in this here. If you are not familiar with the features specific to the various Android versions, make sure you check out our dedicated Android version scoop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a brief video rundown of the Xperia E user interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E has the usual homescreen configuration, with five docked shortcuts (the app drawer shortcut and two on each of its sides). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them. For folders, you get smaller icons of the first four items inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with older Sony smartphones, you can change the color theme of the launcher according to your preferences. Depending on the color you've chosen the breathing light below the screen will light up with the same color tone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen does a neat trick called Overview mode, which lets you quickly find a widget across any of your homescreen panes. Pinch to zoom out on any of the homescreen panes and a new screen opens up showing all active widgets for easy viewing and selection. Tapping on a widget takes you directly to the homescreen it is on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E has some custom-made Sony widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widgets (stream and friends) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, but the Album gallery is).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on an empty area of a homescreen opens up a contextual menu. It gives you the customization options - choose a widget, a wallpaper, a theme, an app shortcut and create a new folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving widgets around is as simple as on droids of old - hold a finger over a desired widget to move it. The action has a cool wobble effect to it. Sadly, widgets that have already been positioned will not move out of the way of the new ones you are trying to place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool addition to the lockscreen, missing from some Xperia phones of old, is the Walkman widget which lets you control music playback without unlocking the phone. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area is also present, and features a couple of connectivity toggles (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi), a sound toggle, a button to expand all expandable notifications, and a settings shortcut. The notification area is also accessible from the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual task switcher, part of vanilla ICS, is also on board. You can access it with a tap and hold on the Home key.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like the Xperia E dual, the Xperia E is powered by a Qualcomm MSM7227A chipset, which packs a 1GHz ARM Cortex-A5 processor, 512MB of RAM and Adreno 200 GPU. Those are hardly the guts of a benchmark champion, but they are quite common among entry level smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've compared the Xperia E family with other entry-level devices do give you a clearer picture as to which ones have the edge when it comes to performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BenchmarkPi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant gives the smartphone an all-round grade for processing (calculative and graphic, memory speed, SD card writing, etc). The Xperia E scored just about the same as its dual-SIM counterpart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 200 GPU is an old design, but it can handle the HVGA resolution on most occasions. As you can see from the graphic benchmarks, it managed to score 26.9 fps on NenaMark 2 and 26.0 fps on the newly released Epic Citadel - an excellent result for a low-end device, suggesting that you'll be able to play quite a few games on it. It won't always be the smoothest experience, but less demanding titles should offer very playable framerates.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The visually customized phonebook of the Xperia E is virtually the same as on vanilla Android and can store extensive contact information. A tabbed interface allows you to access your contact list, recent calls, and info from social networking services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from certain accounts and SIM cards (you can fine-sift specific groups from an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), there's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail, and custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike its dual-SIM counterpart, the Xperia E has the standard telephony features. The signal strength is relatively strong and we had no issues with in-call quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is enabled and searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad on the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list. You can hide the keypad the make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Xperia E automatically disables the touchscreen when you place it next to your face during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Xperia E, and it scored an Average mark. It's just 1db below our Good result though and missed calls and notification are quite unlikely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use a standard threaded layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that as well. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia E offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is not as convenient as on some of the larger screens seen in the Xperia line, but is still fairly comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It works the same as Swype, and even if you've never used Swype input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Album handles pictures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E comes with the proprietary Sony image gallery, dubbed Album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are organized into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can opt to show all of your albums in one place, and there are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can use pinch gestures to make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller. The whole thing is super responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids with very smooth transitions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Map reminds us of the iOS gallery, where all geotagged pictures are shown on a world map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab displays pictures from Google Picasa and Facebook. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos much like you did in the previous Xperia Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Movies app is your video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a new interface. It's connected to GraceNote, which helps you find additional information about the movies you have on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E video player handles most of the common formats - it played all DivX, XviD and MP4 videos up to WVGA resolution. MKV files, the AC3 audio codec and subtitles are not supported though. It still did far better than expected and we are quite happy with the app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman audio player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player is laid out across the Playing and My music tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience, while Clear Stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The xLOUD enhancement for increasing the loudness of the internal speaker is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will also be pleased to find a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However true audiophiles might prefer additional players, which sport 10-band or even 20-band equalizers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E also has an FM Radio aboard, complete with RDS support. The app automatically seeks and adds bookmarks to stations in range, although you'll need to have a set of headphones attached to use as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the Sony Xperia E audio output turned out slightly cleaner than that of its dual-SIM sibling. We are not sure if the reason is some optimizations Sony did, unit variations or the different circuitry mandated by the second SIM slot, but it could easily be the second seeing that the difference is pretty minor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier the Xperia E got decent scores for noise levels and dynamic range, while its frequency response left a lot to be desired. The volume levels were pretty poor, too, so the overall performance is rather disappointing here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is there's little degradation when headphones come into play. Stereo crosstalk does take a hit and distortion levels rise, but the frequency response, noise levels and dynamic range actually improve slightly. Unfortunately the volume levels are even lower here and given that even the improved scores are far from perfect, we'd suggest audiophiles keep away from this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see them for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3MP fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E sports a 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera and there is no LED flash. That should be enough to tell you that the smartphone's camera will only do for an occasional photo in case of emergencies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera controls on the Xperia E are available on two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. On the left you get four shortcuts to various settings (scenes, exposure compensation, self-timer and geotagging), while the still camera/camcorder toggle, the virtual shutter and a thumbnail of the last photo taken are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu key brings up a few extra settings - resolution, capturing method, shutter sound and data storage, among others. You can customize all four of the shortcuts on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is nothing to talk about, really. There is not enough resolved detail and there are some blurred areas in still images as well. The noise reduction is harsh, and the dynamic range could use some improvement, too. On a positive note, the colors seem lively and are not too oversaturated.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've put the Xperia E against some other 3MP snappers so you can check the image quality for yourselves in our dedicated Photo Compare Tool. You can choose other adversaries as you please, and all you need to look for is explained in the tools' main page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording is disappointing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E captures VGA video at around 30fps, which is rather poor, but sadly about all you can expect out of a single-core processor and a 3MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder has the same interface as the still camera and some of the same settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 files with a bitrate of 2.0Mbps and stereo AAC sound (128Kbps, 48kHz). The resolved detail isn't great, but it seems as if the noise reduction is less aggressive to the video than it is to still images, as the videos look smoother than expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an untouched VGA@30fps sample taken directly from the Xperia E.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E has quad-band 2G and triple-band 3G connectivity. Mobile data speeds go at 7.2 Mbps of HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP, but no support for USB on-the-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Connected Devices app that also lets you manage DLNA connectivity with the Xperia E. You can either browse content on other DLNA-enabled devices on the same Wi-Fi network, or set the E as a media server for other devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia E also comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, which replaces the former LiveWare manager, although the functionality remains basically the same. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do Wi-Fi tethering too, as it's part of the default Android functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android web browser or Google Chrome - the choice is yours<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia E has the default Android browser on board. It offers a streamlined interface, incognito browsing and other cool features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is quite minimalistic; all you get is a URL bar with a tabs shortcut. Hitting the Menu key gives you more options - Refresh, Forward, Save to bookmarks, Share page, Find on page, full settings and a couple of more - Request desktop site (no more hunting for that "Desktop" option buried at the bottom of the site) and Save for offline reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search engine to Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the amount a double tap will zoom in on a page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bowser offers the nice Search Result Preloading feature - when searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result, it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster if you do click it. You can set this feature to work over Wi-Fi only to preserve data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other trick is Incognito mode - there's no global setting, but you can open individual Incognito tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, the tab switching interface looks exactly like in the Recent apps list. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls (available from the Labs settings) reveal five controls (New tab, Tabs, URL, Bookmarks, More) when you slide your finger in from the side. These really improve the browser experience. Another cool feature from Labs is Full screen, which squeezes out a little more screen real estate by hiding the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adobe Flash is officially not supported on Android already, so you can't expect to have it working. You can still find the APK file on the internet, but given the limited processing power available it's not worth the hassle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also opt for the much-improved Google Chrome web browser, which has also been pre-installed. It's pretty smooth, considering the limited hardware it has at its disposal. The interface is pretty simple - you get a combined URL and search bar at the top. To the right of it there's a tab switcher with the number of open tabs on it. Hitting the menu button reveals options like new tab, bookmarks, look at closed tabs on other devices, request desktop site, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch between tabs you just swipe to the left or right to move between various open pages. In the tab interface you can also swipe away tabs you don't want anymore, except this time with a cooler animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome offers full synchronization with your Google account. Just type it in and it will immediately connect to all of your devices with Chrome installed. The only thing that doesn't get synced is your passwords.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E comes with the OfficeSuite 6 viewer. OfficeSuite 6 lets you view almost any type of document, although you'll have to pay to get the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Notes app that comes with the Xperia E. It's pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note and just start typing or doodling. There's also an option for Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can expand to reveal advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, as well as weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player. There's no world clock, stopwatch or timer though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For everything else not included, the Google Play store is full of free apps that will cater to all your organizational needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps handles the navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E comes with a GPS receiver and A-GPS functionality for near instantaneous locks using network data. Alternatively, network positioning will do if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline from the menu" and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make the entire United States available offline, not even a single state. We managed to fit New York and some of the surrounding area before Maps told us the size is too big. There's no address search either in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android JB, the Xperia E has access to a huge number of apps from the Android Play store but the limited amount of onboard storage means you'll need to be careful with large apps or just look for ones that support microSD card install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like its dual-SIM counterpart, the Sony Xperia E offers quite the feature set for such a conservative price point. It's currently available for under ?130 in most markets - about ?10 less than the E dual, and is the one of the very few smartphones from top-tier manufacturers that run Jelly Bean in this segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the less than stellar hardware, the Xperia E provides performance that isn't too bothering with little lag and acceptable app loading times. The 1GHz CPU has really helped bring the user experience from slightly irritating to acceptable and that is about as good as thing get in this class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The differences between Sony's Jelly Bean and ICS builds are not very significant when it comes to the Xperia E pair, at least in regards to visible changes in the UI. The Xperia E dual will most likely get the Jelly Bean update as well, so the only thing the single-SIM Xperia E really has left going for it is better battery performance in standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia E dual</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we believe these two phones are clearly targeting very different sets of users. Dual-SIM has its distinct uses and has been enjoying increased demand. Almost all leading smartphone manufacturers have pairs like the Xperia E to give their users greater choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's why the Xperia E's most likely alternative is the Samsung Galaxy Young S6310. It has a slightly smaller screen of the same HVGA resolution, a 3MP camera and a 1GHz CPU. The Galaxy Young has launched on Jelly Bean and it too has a dual-SIM twin.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>LG currently doesn't a direct Xperia E rival in its portfolio, with the Sony smartphone fitting right between the Optimus L3 II and Optimus L5 II. However, if you don't mind checking out the last season collection, the original Optimus L5 will match the Xperia E resolution, while offering a much bigger 4" screen and a more capable 5MP auto-focus camera. You will have to live with Android ICS, though.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>HTC's foray into affordable droids comes in the form of the Desire C. The Desire C features a slower 600 MHz processor, and won't be getting an Android upgrade beyond its current ICS build, but is priced at just ?120 in most markets, and offers a better camera and the arguably cooler looking Sense.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Having looked at the super affordable Androids, the cheapest WP8-powered competition seems to be making a seriously strong case. The Nokia Lumia 520, which we recently reviewed, easily beats the above selection by offering a dual-core CPU (of the Krait variety, no less) and 720p video, in addition to more than twice the screen resolution. The Lumia 520 costs about the same as the Xperia E, too, so unless the relatively limited app selection in the Windows Phone Store is a deal-breaker, it clearly offers more bang for your buck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bottom line, the Sony Xperia E is a reasonable package and if you do a lot of web browsing, the Jelly Bean's browser optimizations may be enough to convince you to fork out the cash. However, at this point it feels that the entry level market isn't the best place to be looking if you are into the Android platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google OS really starts show its full potential on the smartphones in the ?150-?170 price range, but it just feels too constrained on the limited hardware on entry level smartphones such as the Xperia E. So we'd suggest either save a few more bucks, or consider the alternative in the face of WP8.</paragraph>
