			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia had two big announcements to make a few months ago. And yes, it?s a matter of perspective but, on certain markets, the S40-powered Asha series can be as big as Windows Phone. Anyway, now that the Lumia smartphones have had their deserved hype, it?s time for the Asha handsets to step forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S40 platform got recently treated to lots of visual updates and the latest feature phones have joined the 1GHz league. The new Asha 303 seem to be sparing no effort to bring the complete user experience to traditionally loyal Nokia markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first, it felt strange, but a few minutes into it, we knew we were with a friend. The Asha 303 offers the familiar convenience of Touch and Type phones, but comes with a slightly bigger screen and ? most importantly ? a full QWERTY keyboard. With a connectivity set that borders on premium and a powerful 1GHz processor, the Asha 303 is ready to lead a Nokia return to markets the Finns like to call their own..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 303 is in charge of a lineup that tries to cover the entire range of the low end. From a basic Dual SIM solution to different combinations of touchscreen and QWERTY and cameras ranging from 2 to 5 megapixel ? there should be a phone for every use and budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Save for the 3.2 megapixel camera (it?s fixed-focus across the range), the Asha 303 is the best equipped handset of the lineup. Not only is it the first QWERTY/touchscreen S40 phone, the capacitive display is a debut for the platform. The penta-band 3G support along with Wi-Fi and USB-on-the-go are worthy of a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 303 is not a smartphone of course and the biggest omission is multitasking. Nokia?s S40 have never had that and it seems a shame that the 1GHz processor will never be really tested. Smart dialing is another No on the list ? would?ve been a nice thing to have on a QWERTY phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the Asha 303 is more than adequately equipped to be an excellent competitor in its class. Let?s see if this messenger delivers on time ? and on price. Coming up next is our traditional tour of the exterior.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Asha 303<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 retail package is simple and to the point. There is a charger, the familiar short Nokia microUSB cable, a single-piece headset and some printed stuff. There is a 2GB microSD card inserted in the phone as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 303 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 measures 116.5 x 55.7 x 13.9 mm ?not too big, but not impressively compact either. The QWERTY messenger isn?t remarkably slim but the curved shape gives it a rather comfortable fit in the hand. At just 99 g, the Asha 303 is lightweight and easy to handle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 303 has the body shape and styling of the Nokia X2-01 ? adding a prominent accent in the brushed metal battery cover. Surprisingly, the Asha is a bit more compact and weighs less than its all-plastic predecessor. It is a simple yet stylish handset even though the messenger form factor doesn?t allow too much creative freedom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Budget or not, the phone doesn?t feel and look cheap. The finish is simple but quality and the whole thing feels solid and well-built. Resistance to fingerprints is a point in favor too. There?s a touch of metal on the rear, which doesn?t add too much weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.6" capacitive TFT touchscreen has QVGA resolution and can display up to 256K colors. Despite its decent brightness, the image quality is nothing to get excited about. The sunlight legibility is decent, but not perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.6? display is on the small side ? for a touch phone ? but it does the job. The first capacitive unit on a S40 handset is nicely responsive without overdoing it. It?s tuned to ignore very light presses, which we usually prefer over displays that seem to detect your finger midair. The touchscreen offers the trademark Nokia haptics we?ve been consistently impressed with. Wherever you tap on the display, you?ll feel the vibration right under your fingertip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four keys under the display with a smooth black glossy coating: two Call keys and two shortcut buttons (Messaging and Music). They are all decently sized and with distinct press ? and their finish sets them apart from the keyboard. The color contrast between the keyboard and the glass covering the touchscreen creates an impression of a QWERTY slider, rather than a simple candybar. The illusion is reinforced by the screen coating edging above the top row of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four-row QWERTY keyboard has well defined and reasonably sized keys. The nicely convex buttons are pleasingly tactile and size shouldn?t be an issue unless you have really big thumbs. The backlighting is impressively sharp and solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only things to note on the front are an ambient light sensor and the earpiece at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the Nokia Asha 303 has nothing but the lanyard eyelet. The right side is more crowded, featuring the lock key and the volume rocker. There is no dedicated camera key on the Asha 303, which isn?t such a big deal ? not with a fixed focus camera anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Nokia Asha 303 features the microUSB port, the 3.5mm audio jack and the charger plug. The phone can be charged off the USB port and there?s even USB On-the-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece is integrated in the keypad, so there is nothing to see at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the handset features the 3 megapixel camera lens at the top and the loudspeaker grill at the bottom. There?s no LED flash and the camera lens has no protection against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the steel battery cover reveals the SIM compartment, the microSD card slot and the 1300 mAh BP-3L Li-Ion battery. To access either of the card slots you need to get the battery out of the way, so no hot-swap for the Asha 303.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quoted at up to 8 hours and 10 minutes of talk time and 720 hours of standby in 2G networks or 7 hours and 10 minutes of talk time and 840 hours of standby in 3G networks, the battery really sounds like something. Nokia also promise up to 47 hours of music playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressive is a difficult word to use to describe a basic package like the Nokia Asha 303. If anything about it comes close to that though, it?s the build quality. In fact, it should be one of the phone?s key selling points alongside the QWERTY keyboard and the capacitive touchscreen. We shouldn?t be surprised though ? we had the same pleasurable experience with the Nokia X2-01, which clearly is the Asha 303?s prototype.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 303 is the first S40 phone to combine a touchscreen and a full QWERTY keyboard. It?s the first capacitive screen for the platform too. Of course, the QVGA resolution (and the generally poor display quality) is something to warn against but in terms of ergonomics and build, the Asha 303 is a handset that won?t let you down. And there?s plenty of new skill, some of which you wouldn?t normally expect in an entry level phone. Stay with us, as we continue to explore the new generation of S40.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Touch and Type S40 UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 runs on the touch-enabled iteration of the Series 40 software. We already met with this version while reviewing the C2-02 and C2-03, so if you too have met with one of them, you probably know pretty much anything about the S40 ticking inside the new Asha 303.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-enabled version of the S40 platform brings only skin-deep changes like the refreshed icons, a la Symbian-Anna. And a few usability improvements, like the homescreen swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the Asha 303 on video, to give you an idea of what the touch-enabled S40 user interface looks like:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode (or Home screen mode, as Nokia call it here) is available as usual. It divides the screen into four sections, each of which is effectively a widget. The top row of the screen is reserved for status indicators (time, signal, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the clock is on top, followed by Social (Facebook, Twitter and Flickr integration) and two Shortcut bars at the bottom, each of which grants instant access to four favorite functions or apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two swipe gestures available on the homescreen. A left or right swipe can be set to launch an app (both native and Java) or change the phone profile. By default, a left swipe opens the message composer and a right swipe opens the Java apps and games folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no D-pad on the Nokia Asha 303 but the soft keys are there. Only virtual this time ? they?re at the bottom of the screen, and there?s a virtual Menu key between them. The soft keys are user-configurable ? you can assign a shortcut of choice to each of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has only two views ? Grid and List. The grid layout is handy for offering numpad shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Go To shortcut is available and it's yet another way to add shortcuts to the homescreen. It?s the kind of quick menu we?ve seen on many S40 handsets but touchscreen makes so much difference. It offers quick access to nine shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen on the Nokia Asha 303 pretty standard ? a clock and a tap-to-unlock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing missing is an accelerometer. Unlike some of its S40 non-touch siblings, the Nokia Asha 303 leaves out features like tap-for-time and turn-to-mute. As for screen auto rotation, it?s not badly missed we think, given the screen size. Some might still find it a nuisance though ? having to manually set display orientation where it matters: in the image gallery and the video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest omission as usual is multitasking - we gave up hope that Nokia will add that a long time ago. This leads to bottlenecks though they are rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't leave it running in the background. You have to go through that every time you want to do something with the app, except check the latest notification (notifications do come in the background and only the last one is displayed).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard S40 phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia Asha 303 will store about 2000 contacts depending on the fields you use, which isn?t as good as unlimited storage but should do for most of the users out there. You can set the phonebook to display contacts from the phone memory, SIM memory or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a contact is simple and straightforward ? the phone asks for number, first and last name and that?s it. When you need to add other details you can always go back and edit the contact. The phonebook can be set up to automatically store new contacts in a chosen location (phone, SIM) or to always ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separate from last names, eliminating problems, which may occur with synchronization. You can assign ringtones to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy shortcut in the Options menu for each contact brings up the SMS communication you've had with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone book has search functionality and kinetic scrolling. Contacts can be copied, moved or deleted either individually or in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony offers call recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The reception on the Nokia Asha 303 was consistently good and in-call sound was crisp and clear, though not as loud as we would have liked. The lack of smart dialing was not surprising for an S40 device. There?s no voice dialing either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, Voice Clarity and call recording are supported from the Options in-call menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a call, the screen remains locked until you use the hardware unlock (there's no proximity sensor).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out the Nokia Asha 303 scored an Excellent mark. The strength of the vibration was good too - you're unlikely to miss calls with the Asha 303. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY-fied messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 comes with the standard (and quite capable) S40 messaging. It can handle all the common message types including SMS, MMS, as well as flash and audio messages and there?s easy email setup, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware keyboard on the Nokia Asha 303 isn't the best we've seen, because of the smallish keys. At least their shape is comfy and eases the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Inbox view is available but you also get Conversations view mode (that?s the threaded message feature).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor is well organized and you won?t spend too much time finding your way around. Nokia has added four new virtual controls to make up for the missing D-pad ? two arrow keys, letter case switch and symbols.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course you can tap to move the cursor wherever you want, but you?ll still need those two arrows for precise positioning. The symbol and letter case features are also available from the numpad, so there is no real need for them on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing the message there?s a character counter and message part counter available and when you?re done you pick the recipient from the contacts list, the recently used numbers, the call log or contact groups. You can have a favorite contact too (just one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, you can enter the number manually if it?s not on any of those lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app lets you create multiple accounts on multiple networks with just your email address and password. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emails are received in the background and you can put a Mail widget on the homescreen to keep track of new emails (the widget offers practically no info on the new emails though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's not the end of the messaging capabilities on the Asha 303 either. The Chat app supports Facebook, Google Talk, Ovi Chat, Windows Live Messenger, MySpce IM and Yahoo! Chat. The tabbed UI of the OS is pleasantly thumb-friendly. We wish it had a unified list of contacts from all services though, it would have made finding the right contact easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Chat widget for the homescreen too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Simple image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos app on the Nokia Asha 303 offers only a single viewing mode, displaying a grid of 12 pictures on the screen. You can switch to landscape mode from the menu though ? it makes better use of the screen real estate when you open a photo (there are black bars in portrait mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kinetic scrolling is available and zooming into photos (via on-screen shortcuts) is relatively quick, but the animation for both isn't particularly smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a simple image editor too, which can crop/rotate images, add text, clipart and effects, plus adjust brightness/contrast and color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize photos into albums, view them in a timeline and, of course, you can start a slide show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the regular Gallery app, it?s still here ? but it?s hidden in the Applications menu. It?s a capable file manager, especially for a feature phone. It can manage folders and files ? both one by one and in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic music player, offers shuffle<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Nokia Asha 303 practically hasn?t seen any changes except getting touch support. It looks decent and has a solid set of features, including album art, and a fair number of supported formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Songs can be filtered by artist, album and genre. The player handles AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, WMA, AMR-NB. Naturally the A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there are some annoying limitations - for example, hitting the red receiver key turns off the music player and goes to the homescreen. The player can work in the background, but you have to go to Options &gt; Play in background for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, when not in the Now playing interface, there is no way to pause a song or skip to the next one, not even with the homescreen widget. You have to get into the music player to do that (and it doesn?t support swipe gestures like the homescreen does, nor can you assign swipe gestures on the homescreen to things like "next track").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Displaying the artist and title of the currently playing song are all that the homescreen widget does. They appear in the Radio and music area on the homescreen so they need to be enabled in the Homescreen mode settings for the info to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several basic equalizer presets, hidden deeper in the Music player menus,.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to your music library in the Asha 303 is the FM radio. It matches the music player interface and covers all basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS support is available and you can make the handset search and save all available stations in your area. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen, much like with the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio can also record broadcasts but that feature is regional.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player is enhanced with DivX/XviD support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we expected, the limited XviD support from the Touch and Type series is back, but it is now accompanied with DivX too. It managed to play most of the Xvid/DivX videos we threw at it (granted, files have to be up to 700MB and of up to nHD resolution). It?s not the best in the class, but it?s way better than we had hoped for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the user interface is concerned there are shortcuts for fullscreen mode, fast-forward or rewind, capture, shuffle, repeat and that?s that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is quite good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 demonstrated some pretty good audio output, which is impressive given its lowly standing in the food chain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line-out (when used with an active external amplifier), the Asha 303 achieved some pretty great scores all over the field and it was louder than usual. The stereo crosstalk is a bit high, but that's undetectable with a naked ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things do worsen when you plug in a pair of headphones, but it's not too bad. Stereo crosstalk increases less than we are used to, so it's mostly the moderate jump in intermodulation distortion that may cause a few frowns. Still, you can't realistically expect any better in this price range.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring 3MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 has a 3MP fixed-focus snapper that produces photos with maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536. The camera interface has been updated so it's a lot more like Symbian.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the screen you get a column on the bottom with the virtual shutter key in the center and the back and options keys besides it. You can use the camera in portrait mode only, there is no option for landscape orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the screen reveals more controls - indicators (photos remaining, resolution and white balance), digital zoom controls, and three shortcuts for video camera mode, gallery and self-timer. All these auto-hide so they don't take up space on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going into the Options menu, you get a popup that looks like the one on Symbian. There are controls here for effects (greyscale, sepia, negative), white balance, a viewfinder grid and extended settings. The shortcuts in this popup can be re-arranged but you can't pull any of them out onto the viewfinder. This popup also features animations, but they are rather slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is good for a fixed-focus 3MP unit. Photos are quite noisy but the post processing manages to mask a lot of it, at least in bright areas. Shadows however have tons of noise. Contrast and color rendering are good and the amount of captured detail is as much as you would expect from such a camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the samples the Asha 303 produced.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Nokia Asha 303 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. Here you can see the Asha 303 is a decent performer in the 3MP league, but you can still notice the high noise levels.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording isn't something the Asha 303 is good at. It does VGA at 15 fps, quite basic for a 1GHz phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is decent, with good colors and enough amount of detail. The videos will do for MMS, but that's all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 offers quad-band GSM and UMTS support. There is also HSPA support, download speed potentially reaching 10.2 Mbps, and up speed as good as 2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is version 2.1 and A2DP is, of course, enabled. The Nokia Asha 303 uses a microUSB port for both data connections and charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger treat though is USB On-the-go. The Nokia Asha 303 can access USB flash drives and even other phones (card readers don?t work). Non-Nokia-made handsets generally refused to share their memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you happen to connect two USB on-the-go devices ? the master and slave in this connection is determined by the end each of the devioces is connected to. By the way, a special USB-OTG-enabled cable like the one that came with the Nokia N8, is not included in the Asha 303 box. You?ll have to buy one separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi connectivity is also at hand. In fact, the Wi-Fi is one of the key features of the Nokia Asha 303 ? it is one of the cheaper Wi-Fi enabled phones on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 also comes complete with a memory card slot. Coupled with a card reader it can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the standard 3.5mm audio jack, which allows you to use your own headphones, but doesn't have TV-out functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia S40 browser has improved significantly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 boasts a really cool new browser. Its start screen has the usual URL and search bars and three side-scrollable panes below, which are quite reminiscent of the Symbian homescreen (complete with the three dots at the bottom that indicate the current pane).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From left to right, the panes are History, Featured (lists popular sites in several categories) and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One excellent new feature is the autosuggestions as you type in the URL - it lists recently visited sites and filters the list as you type. It even offers to save you a few clicks by guessing the ".com" at the end - Symbian^1 users can only wish their browser can do these things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser uses the Opera Mini trick - compressing web pages on a dedicated server before sending them to the phone. Pages load quickly (even on EDGE) and don't waste much data. Image quality is adjustable (Best/Good/Average or No images).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kinetic scrolling is available (relatively fast, not very smooth). You get only two zoom levels (again, just like Opera Mini) - page overview and zoomed in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the performance is not perfect (the start page UI is quite laggy) and we had some issues where instead of opening a page, the browser would spit out error 400 "Invalid request".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the Adobe Flash Lite 3.0 support, Nokia Asha 303 web browser doesn?t support Flash. If you want to watch some YouTube stuff you?ll have to rely on the mobile version of the website. Anyway, the lack of Flash is not a big deal, especially for that small screen and the hardware specs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer on the Nokia Asha 303 is well stocked as usual and things have been touch optimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar starts off with the month view ? when you press and hold, a bigger number will pop up just above your finger so you can aim easier. When there?s an event on that date, the event description will pop up instead (it?s not visible otherwise, just like in the old S40 version).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Day view is also available, but strangely, week view has gone missing. You have various kinds of events available ? reminder, meeting call, birthday, anniversary and memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are Notes and To-Do apps as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app uses the big, touchable numbers, making it easy to set and you can make it go off only on specific days. You can customize the snooze time too, but there?s only one alarm available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions include a voice recorder with no time limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer. They have been touch optimized as well, though we wish the countdown timer used the same big numbers as the Alarm clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 touchscreen calculator is brand new but has lost the advanced functionality (you only get the four basic math functions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 303 comes with the traditional Converter app as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock can tell the time in up to four cities. It offers a long list of supported cities, but there?s no search (so you have to scroll a lot for, say, Washington) and you can?t just tap on the map either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the Nokia Asha 303 the Social app is in charge of SNS. It handles Facebook, Twitter, Orkut and Flickr accounts, including several accounts of each type (though only one Facebook and one Twitter account can be connected at a time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook section supports most of the communication capabilities of the service. You can view messages and events, friend requests and event invitations. Write on people?s wall and browse their profiles, post photos (either from the Gallery or you can snap a new one on the spot), post status updates, read news feeds and follow groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Twitter is an inherently simpler service but the app has plenty of features too. You can update your status, check your @mentions, send direct messages and reply to tweets too. We missed automatic upload of photos though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S40 doesn?t have multitasking, even in this touch-enabled phase, but you can still receive updates even when you exit the Social app. Put the Social tab on the homescreen and pick a default account and you?re good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default account is what you see first when you start the app (so if you only have a Facebook account, you don?t have to tap the Facebook tab every time). Also, only the updates from the main account will be visible on the homescreen. You can also set the time to receive new updates ? say, from 8:00 to 22:00.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S40 Nokia Store is where the apps are<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can browse the apps available in the Nokia Store by categories ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps track of all the apps you have installed under My stuff. You can now also select where games and apps should be installed and where audio and video should go. That?s nice ? we wish Android had that right from the start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of apps and games there, a lot of them free. They are still behind the big players in the app store game, but for a featurephone having an app store at all is more than we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Asha 300 and 303 owners have an exclusive game waiting for them in the Nokia Store - Angry Birds. It costs ?1 and features everything the iOS or Android versions have. The game runs smoothly on the Asha 303, so no worries here. There is a free demo version pre-installed on the Asha 303 too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps can do little<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 303 doesn?t have a GPS receiver but Nokia Maps can use Cell-ID to get your approximate location. The app doesn?t feature voice-guided navigation anyway and can only plan pedestrian routes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, even if you hook up a Bluetooth GPS receiver to the Nokia Asha 303 it still won't function as a car SatNav. There's no option for a paid upgrade either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps are downloaded through your data connection, which is something else to keep in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a nice bonus for such a low-level device, but including it probably had more to do with not using Google's solution than providing a good mapping solution.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 303 Asha is not a particularly hard one to recommend. In fact, if you want a full-featured messenger without the complications of a smartphone, the Asha 303 should be among the first things on you list to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entry level messengers go all the way back to the likes of the LG GW300 and the Samsung Ch@t. Nokia have a couple of prime examples of their own in the C3 and the X2-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG GW300 ? Samsung Ch@t 322 ? Nokia C3 ? Nokia X2-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s the combination of a touchscreen and a QWERTY keyboard in a feature phone package that sends the Nokia Asha 303 to a niche that?s virtually free of competition. The Motorola Motokey Social looks a pretty close match at least on paper but we?re yet to see it in real action.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Surely you can get a droid for around the same kind of cash. But it will be a compromise like the aging Xperia X10 mini pro. To be fair though, a smartphone is probably not an option for anyone looking at the Asha 303.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 mini pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 303 is the first S40 phone to combine a touchscreen and a full QWERTY keyboard. It?s the first capacitive screen for the platform too. Of course, the resolution is nothing to be excited about ? S40 have been stuck at the QVGA notch for ever. But the Asha 303 is trying hard to make up for that with plenty of new skill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So much of it that the Nokia Asha 303 isn?t quite the entry-level phone that we make it out to be. It?s actually way ahead of the cheap alternatives in the Asha series. The Asha 201 and the dual-SIM Asha 200 are the most basic of QWERTY messengers with regular non-touch displays and just the simplest of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia Asha 201 ? Nokia Asha 200</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a way, the Asha 303 is dangerously close to smartphones. On the other hand, it?s a great opportunity for many potential upgraders, who?re not ready yet to cross that line for one reason or another.</paragraph>
