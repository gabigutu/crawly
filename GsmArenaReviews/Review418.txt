			<paragraph>A few months after launching its new W810 model, Sony Ericsson delivered it to our office. This black twin of the famous W800 model features EDGE and the main menu has undergone slight modifications. All other applications have remained untouched. The new W810 is much more about color emotions, sport spirit, and launching novelties at all costs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>EDGE in black<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It did not take much time. In January 2006 Sony Ericsson announced its new model W810. This black pearl comes to satisfy all customers, for whom the orange-beige Sony Ericsson W800 was just not what they wanted. There is just one crucial change, related to the connectivity features of the device. All the rest is more or less identical to W800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has been ignoring EDGE for quite a long time. They explained the absence of this technology in its European product line with the fact that EDGE is not popular enough in Europe. What's more, many carriers do not even have EDGE support in their networks. It seems, however, that the voices of the SE fans have been finally heard, because, as you can see, Sony Ericsson has decided to change its market philosophy and has implemented EDGE into all its new models, incl. W810.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson W810</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the summer of 2005 I was really pleased with the lively colorful body of Sony Ericsson W800. So when I first saw the official photos of the planned W810 model, I did not like it much. Today I am holding this phone in my hands and I feel obliged to confess that there is something special in it. In reality it looks far better than on the pictures. In this sense, let me recommend you something right at the start of our review: if you are thinking of buying Sony Ericsson W810, but you still have some doubts, please, go to the nearest mobile store and hold it in your hands. I am sure that once you've touched the phone, you will start to think of it in a rather different and much more positive way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Held in hand ? size comparison with a key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;   The forerunner: Walkman Sony Ericsson W800</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sportsman rather than an eye-picker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Dimensions have remained almost unchanged. The new model is thinner by 1 mm. The camera lens mounted in the rear side of the body is not as bulgy as the one in W800. It is not protected by a sliding cover, though, which is quite a pity. Let's hope that outdoor dirt will not have any great impact on the picture quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is accompanied by two LEDs, which also serve as a flashlight. The LEDs can be activated from both the camera application and the main menu. The LEDs can be set to emit constant light for one minute, or even send out SOS signals. They are quite powerful, being able to illuminate an entire living room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Camera lens and loudspeaker grill</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill is located below the camera lens. Sound performance does not get worse when the phone lies on flat surface, because the speaker area on the back cover of the phone is slightly raised, preventing this way the speaker from getting muffled by the underlying surface. Self-portraits mirror is not silver as usual, but orange which is a really cool solution. The Walkman logo incrusted in the removable back cover is quite attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Walkman logo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Black design does not catch your eyes in the way W800 did. I myself perceive the new W810 as a sport model rather than a fashion freak. My impression is probably caused by the tiny orange and silver elements, incrusted in the body of the phone, I guess. The top edge of the device features the Infrared port and the main switch-off button. On the left side you will see the Sony Walkman logo, the Play/Pause button, and the memory card slot protected by a solid rubber cover. To take out the memory card you must open the protection cover and press on the tiny plate inside. It is a Memory Stick Pro Duo card with a capacity of 512 MB, which in the case of a music mobile like SE W810 is more meeting necessity than boasting spacious luxury. The memory card can be pulled out while the phone is on since it has hot swap functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   All side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;Play/Pause button ? Walkman logo ? Memory card slot cover ? Memory Stick Pro Duo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the device you will find the volume control button and the camera release button. When you take pictures in the dark, the camera emits three blue-white signals to ease user's orientation. On the bottom part of the phone there are to be found the microphone and the Fast-Port connector.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Navigation key not bad at all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alphanumeric keys work seamlessly. Typing is a pleasure. Keys are distributed evenly and the spacing among them is pretty sufficient. There are no extravagant deflections or curves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;Keypad details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Greatest modifications are to be found in the design of the functional part of the keypad. The phone has no joystick. Instead, it features a four-way navigation key with confirming middle area. Each way of the navigation key as well as its central part is assigned a special function when the music player is running. Those special functions are even inscribed on the navigation key itself - there is the PLAY symbol, the FORWARD symbol, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Flawless alphanumeric keys</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Context keys and the C correction key are located in two additional circles, which harmonize well with the main navigation key. On the edges of the phone you will also see a button providing direct access to the music player and a button for direct access to the Activity Menu. Phone's edges are bulgy and a bit elevated, while the above mentioned functional keys are located into their own grooves. When I saw the first official photos of Sony Ericsson W810, I did not have even the slightest idea that working with it would be so comfortable. I appreciate the decision of SE designers to create a separate access key both for music player and the Activity Menu. Let me only remind you that in W800 only the player was assigned a special access button, while in K750 the privileged application was the Activity Menu.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We should not forget to mention the battery. Unfortunately, its properties are a little bit different from the properties of the SE W800 battery. The music player, being the most energy-consuming application in the phone, brings down battery durability to less than two days, which is far too short for a music phone. According to the manufacturer's official statements, Sony Ericsson W810 is able to offer a stand-by time of 350 hours or a total of 480 minutes of call time. Nevertheless, bear in mind that intensive usage is likely to shrink the charging cycles to as much as a half of the above mentioned times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a SIM card is inserted or the battery is extracted, a mere quarter of the back cover of W810 needs to be removed. The battery can be extracted and inserted without any greater difficulties, while the SIM card will make you sweat. Both constructional solutions contribute to the phone's solidity and prove how brilliant the elaboration of its entire body is. The phone does not give a creak, no matter how heavily it is pressed. There are no unnecessary gaps. Just great!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Removing the rear cover</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You are so fine?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What a pity the delivery package does not contain a polishing cloth for the display. Fingerprints are visible everywhere. At the same time, the display is very likely to get easily scratched for it is not imbedded. Having in mind, however, that it is style that runs the whole idea about W810, we could probably excuse this inconvenience. The truth is that such a big glossy surface leveled with the rest of the phone's body is quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Deactivated display in daylight ? active in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is fine. Resolution is nothing special, nor is the size of the active TFT. These two details, however, create a fascinating picture of 176 x 220 pixels on a surface of 10.5 cm2 or 1.6 inch2. I am pretty surprised to see that even after half a year this display still looks excellent among strong QVGA competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Graphic design has undergone certain, mostly cosmetic modifications. As usual, the phone has four preinstalled themes including a light and an inverse one. If you are in need of more themes, simply connect to the Internet and download the ones you like. But to my opinion, the originally preset orange theme suits the phone pretty well. Dark wallpapers do not look bad on W810, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Start-up image ? animated wallpaper ? orange theme</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Animated wallpaper can also be used as background. The menu pulses, comes out from aside, expands from the middle towards the margins... In his review about Sony Ericsson K750 my colleague Lutonsk? mentioned that he had grown tired with the animation in time. In the case of Sony Ericsson W810, however, graphic show has not stopped to amuse me, even though I have been using the phone for several days already. Well, different people, different tastes. In any case, the group of content customers would have been larger if the phone allowed deactivation of the animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>         Alternative color themes</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New file transfer solutions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The disc including PC Suite also carries the Disc2Phone program, which supports recording of music files. This program reads and rips music CDs, creating MP3 files from them, and copies them to the memory card. Well, it should. In fact, I did not manage to use the Disc2Phone and make the phone transfer MP3 files, not even after having installed all the necessary control tools. I consider this problem occasional and it might as well be caused by my mistake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Completely new PC Suite ? modifying pictures in the phone ? music file transfers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike Sony Ericsson W800, the W810 model would not permit me to use a standard Windows File Manager for music downloads. The phone would not let me explore the memory card. Instead, I had to put up with the 20 MB of the internal memory of the phone. Eventually, I ended up using the File Manager from PC Suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB support on W810 works seamlessly. The phone is recognized as a removable hard disk and can be accessed without any problems. We even managed the phonebook on the memory card effortless. The only vital issue about the USB connection is that you need to uninstall any previous PC Suite for a Sony Ericsson phone in order to operate with W810. If you have other versions of the PC Suite installed, you won't be able to connect the phone without additional USB drivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The drive contains all kinds of media files - pictures, ringtones, MP3 files. The latter are sorted into a special folder. Be careful though. If you save MP3 files directly into this folder, the phone will not be able to manage them and will ask you to use Disc2Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;USB data cable ? Memory card adapter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there is a way to skip the use of Disc2Phone. You just have to put your mp3 files in MSSEMC\Media_files\audio. In order for the phone to recognize them, though, you have to put them into a user created Album folder that is located into a user created Artist folder. It is easy - you create an Artist folder, you create an Album subfolder and paste all your MP3 files in that subfolder directly through the windows explorer. To improve the process even more, use a memory card reader. 1 MB of data gets downloaded into the phone in approximately 3 to 4 seconds. In other words, you need four minutes to download a 70 MB album onto the Memory Stick.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>And the beat goes on?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Listening to music through the earphones does not exclude simultaneous usage of other applications. Even if you run more than one tasks at the same time, the speed of the menu remains excellent. The other stunning moment comes when you put the earphones into your ears. The longer you leave them there, the more pleased you will be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphones need to be plugged into the Fast Port connector. If you let your hand slide down the supplying wire, it will run into a tiny clip, which allows the cable to be fixed onto the user's clothes. The clip can be moved all along the cable or removed fully. Right behind it you will find a classic jack connector. Due to it you have the chance to use your own earphones as well. If you do so, you need to be very careful with the supplying cable for the distance between the phone and the slot of the connector is not short at all. Moreover, make sure you have also measured the length of the supplying cable of your earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Enclosed earphones ? equipped with special extensions</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original 'plugs' are equipped with long wires so that one can place them around their neck. I miss the striking rubber sleeve featuring manufacturer's logo, which was located on the cable attached to the silver version of Sony Ericsson W800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could easily plug-in another pair of earphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphones are equipped with soft rubber extensions, which go deep into your ears. Similar to Koss The Plug, for example, they pad the sound supply and then use it as a sound media. Reproduction is brilliant. Bass elements are perfect. In terms of quality they are comparable to Koss Sporta Pro. A bit worse (yet still quite good) is the band of the medium and the high frequency, where standard open earphones do better, as the sound is more spacey and clearer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the summer of 2005 I wrote about the sound output of Sony Ericsson W800 in a quite a positive way. In the case of W810 I am not going to be as favorable. A few days ago I had the chance to test the music performance of the new Nokia N91 (read a detailed review of Nokia N91) and it seems that the music queen leading the parade will be exactly N91.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Silence of the city<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson's earphones remind me of 2+1 speaker sets for PC. I mean the higher quality ones, like Logitech Z-3 or Hercules XPS 2.100, whose bass elements are perfect and soft, but higher and medium elements are somewhat unstable and to enjoy the sound of the guitars, for example, you need to buy another, better speaker set. All this holds true in the performance of W810 earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, these are the best earphones you can get attached to a MP3 player in a delivery box, not to mention the fact that here they are basically delivered together with a great mobile phone. They are not the type of earphones you would immediately replace. Just on the contrary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Three pairs of rubber extensions, each one of different size; all of them in the delivery box</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the rubber pads you will be able to comfortably listen to your favorite music both at home and in a crowded street. Walking the city streets with earphones plugged in your ears you will probably feel as if the whole world has activated its "mute" mode. It is almost impossible to hear a passing-by car. The plus is that the noise that surrounds you cannot affect the MP3 sound. On the other hand, it brings along huge risks for without your ears your main defensive reactions are basically reduced to zero. And this is dangerous indeed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Phone's main feature is its MP3 player. You start it either through the relevant icon in the menu, or by a press on the button right above the navigation key. In fact, you do not even need to switch on the phone to enjoy the advantages of the player, because every time you turn on the phone, you are asked, whether it is only the Walkman you are going to use, or the entire phone. Fortunately, the presence of this question is user configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Walkman or the phone - the first choice to make once the device has been activated ? new Sony Walkman icon ? Player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player plays successfully MP3 and AAC file formats. It sorts music by artist's name and then by file's title. It is not necessary to have all the ID3 tag fields of a certain MP3 file filled in. On one hand this is a certain disadvantage for when you play a song, whose ID3 tag is not filled in, neither the performer's name, nor the title of the song gets displayed. But on the other hand, it is a plus as the phone does not necessarily needs an ID3 tag to work with MP3 files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The folder called Music contains all the music tracks. I didn't use this section at all. Instead, W810 could have offered a folder called Albums, which wouldn't have to depend on artists. The next item in the menu is Playlists. It allows creating an unlimited number of playlists, in which you can select artists and their entire albums, or gradually add individual songs. Playlists are very easy and quick to create. They are automatically saved. You just have to entitle them. Additional modifications are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordering by artist name ? song list ? creating a playlist of one's own</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The playing process alone can be controlled by the four-way navigation key. By pressing on the right or the left part you list songs or go to the previous or the following songs. By a long press on one of the horizontal ways you move within the relevant music file. The process of 'forwarding' is noiseless. The vertical ways of the navigation button serve for making the screen of the display open with a curtain effect, revealing currently used playlist. Feel free to browse the playlist, as this does not interrupt the playback of the running music file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>W810 player is easy to control even when the keypad is locked as both the volume button and the play/stop button continue to work. The swing button on the right side of the phone controls volume properties. If you press and hold the plus or the minus button (for about a second) the previous or respectively the following track gets read. The play/stop button on the left side of the phone either stops the playing process, or switches off the player. By pressing it once again you activate the player again and the song that has being played continues from the moment where it was stopped, no matter where in the menu you currently are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though I kept wearing Sony Ericsson W810 in the back pocket of my trousers, I did not have a single problem with the music player. Blindfold, I would easily find the button I was looking for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Some details that have not been given a finishing touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are using another application together with the player, the title of the relevant song as well as the name of its performer scrolls horizontally in a grey line in the upper part of the display. What I do not understand is why the text that appears on the MP3 player main display has not been designed to scroll, too. If the current song title is a bit longer and doesn't fit on the screen, you will not be able to read it at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Scrolling text ? except for the player, where it remains still</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Replacing or moving a file is not allowed. Songs can only be sorted by artist name, file name or in the order, in which they were added into the playlist. Playlist repeating and shuffling is available, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player is equipped with a 5-band equalizer. You can choose among several preset modes - straight equalizing curve, bass accentuation, extreme bass accentuation (the famous Walkman Mega Bass), an equalizer preset for speech reproduction, and an independent heights accentuation. In all these cases, except for the Mega Bass, the relevant curve can be set manually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sharp, colorful, high-flown<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The photos you see in this review are taken with one of the best mobile phone cameras in the history of mobile devices. To activate the camera apply a long press on the release button or select the camera application inside the main menu. Hold the phone horizontally, just like you would do it with a common digital camera. When you half-press the camera release button, it takes the phone 2-3 seconds to focus automatically. According to our comparing method, Sony Ericsson W810 is somewhat slower than its competitors. On the other hand, its photographic skills make efforts worth. The phone takes excellent pictures. What's more, its macro mode gives brilliant results too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures are taken in three different resolutions: 160 x 120, 640 x 480 and 1632 x 1224 pixels, and saved in JPEG format. Sony Ericsson W810 also captures videos in 3GP format with a resolution of 176 x 144 pixels. Recording length is only limited by the available free space on the memory card. A 4x, 30-step digital zoom is available, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W810 camera offers plenty of setup options. Beside standard pictures you can capture panorama landscapes or a fast sequence of four shots in burst mode. Lens shutter works seamlessly. The focus signal and the release sound cannot be deactivated directly from the camera menu. To mute them you will have to activate the phone's silent mode (might not work with all firmwares). Anyways, Sony Ericsson has implemented four different lens shutter sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Viewing pictures inside the camera menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  New File Manager and multimedia tabs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on, the menu allows you to set the size of the pictures; it also offers two quality grades, a flash option, a macro mode, a night mode, a self-release function, several graphic effects, white colour balance, date and time. In addition, there's an option to choose whether you want the pictures to be saved on the Memory Stick, or in the phone's memory. A bit annoying is the fact that the camera options menu closes every time a setting has been applied. Exposure is compensated by the use of the horizontal ways of the main navigation button. To zoom in or zoom out use the swing volume button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Extensive compensation options for the exposition</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W800 camera is identical to the cameras used in SE K750 and W800 but I took several new photos, including a few ones in macro mode. They are all 300 to 600 KB in size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos in full resolution:        &nbsp;&nbsp;   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Without applying macro mode ? with active macro mode</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Radio and RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you get tired of your own music, turn on the radio. To start it, just plug in the earphones. Then you can play it through the loud speaker as well. The radio is stereophonic; the received signal is very clear and stable, there are no interferences in the broadcast. Of course, it depends on the position of the supplying wire that serves as an antenna and leads to the earphones. But generally, stations are very easy to find.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio supports RDS. It displays the name of the radio station or even additional information, if it is being broadcasted - like artists' names or songs' titles. The radio offers 20 saving positions for stations in the frequency scale of 87.5 up to 108.0 MHz. You can either search yourself, or leave the automatic mode to do so. The latter works perfectly. It finds the station with the strongest broadcast almost immediately and saves it into the memory at your will. Within the memory, however, you need to manually enter the names of the saved stations. The phone does not record them automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Radio ? station names need to be added manually</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the K750 model we were complaining about strange cracking sounds coming out every other second during radio broadcast. In W810 they have been eliminated. Its radio tunes automatically when you travel and you pass different broadcasting frequencies. Sound is more or less satisfactory, thanks to the quality of the earphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phoning - cornerstone of all mobiles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W810 offers a traditionally high call sound quality, even though a little bit wider volume scale could have come in handy too. The sound becomes even better if you plug in the earphones - something I'm sure you will be doing almost all the time, anyway. After all, the W810 is a real Walkman. The connector situated in the middle part of the cable serves as a base for the microphone of the handsfree set. The button situated on the connector is for accepting or rejecting an incoming call. Sound is brilliant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone offers ringing sounds in MID, AMR or MP3 format. Surprisingly, files sound much better when they are played through the player than when they are used as ringtones for incoming calls. In the latter case they sound much too loud and thus quite unpleasant. Sony Ericsson W810 rings very loudly. You cannot miss an incoming call, no matter in which pocket you have tucked away the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing is easy to hear while the phone is playing music as well. The mobile handsfree profile gets activated automatically once the earphones have been connected. Incoming calls stop the music player. In the earphones you will hear the ringing sound that has been set. To accept a call, press the button mounted in the middle of the cable. The message system works alike. You will easily recognize new messages by their specific melody or tone. Once the ringing has stopped or the message tone has been muted, the player continues its function from the moment where it stopped.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone has 1000 contact maximum capacity which is just enough, considering that W810 is not a smartphone. The only detail displayed when you browse contacts in W810 is the default number. To search for more fields, use the right and left arrows. Email addresses appear almost immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing numbers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every name can be assigned 5 types of phone numbers, each appearing only once. In addition, each number type can be assigned a specific voice dialling. Here are the other fields: user's ID for Instant Messaging, web address, picture, custom ringtone, title, company's name, street, city, region, post code, country, note, and birthday. When you enter birthday details, the phone asks you, whether you like to save them into the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Plenty of fields attached to each contact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers two ways to order your contacts - by the contact's first or last name. Contacts can be included in a user created group. The phonebook, however, does not allow the assigning of a custom picture or ringtone to these groups. Calls are filtered on a group base.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>W810 works with SMS, EMS and MMS as well as emails and instant messages. It offers sound MMS as well. The T9 dictionary can be permanently deactivated. But should you decide to use it, it will make typing a lot easier. Most frequently used words are displayed on first positions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Typing SMS ? four lines available ? newly received message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The font is large enough, but its color is not absolutely black. The black nuance used here is somewhat a shade of the common one. At the same time it is bold and very easy to read. W800 font is far much better than the thin letters used in older Sony Ericsson models. Typing is quite fast. The phone reacts immediately. Typing speed stays the same even when a longer message consisting of 20 or so 160-character-submessages is being created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editor alerts you of the end of each submessage when you come to write its final characters. It does not count from the beginning of the message. When you send it, a list of people from the phonebook, whom you have recently sent messages, appears on the display. To send the message simply select the contact you need. The MMS editor is well organized too. A MMS can contain a maximum of 300 KB. Pictures, sounds or videos can also be attached to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No modifications in Calendar and Alarm clock applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W810 is equipped with a detailed and very practical calendar. Years, months and weeks are searched easily through the use of the keypad buttons. All three standard views - month, week, and day - are available too. There is only one type of event. Entered events can be assigned an alert at exact time, but cannot be set to repeat directly from the phone alone. Repetition is available when the phone is synchronized with PC. Writing of events is again supported by the T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Month ? week ? and day view at the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock in Sony Ericsson W810 allows alarms to be repeated on selected days. It gets activated, even if the phone is turned off. A choice between three alert types is available: standard ring bell, radio broadcast, and a favorite MP3 file (from the memory card).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The time organizer offers tasks, too. Tasks are possible to mark off, once they have been accomplished. Here you will also find a notes application, a stopwatch, and a countdown option. Also available is a simple calculator and a code memory application, in which information is protected by a four-character access password and a control word for authorization. W810 does not have a unit converter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Task Manager</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fast gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>JBenchmark testing applications ran on Sony Ericsson W810 lightning fast. Black SE Walkman scored nearly the same like W800. In terms of graphics both models are among the fastest on the current market. Here are the results of W810:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the Entertainment section you will find two Java games. The first one is JC Does TEXAS, where you shoot and then fly berserk among clouds. The other game is QuadraPop, that is, a classic tetris, featuring colorful music notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;QuadraPop ? setting up the size of the application window</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Human Interface Device (HID) profiles are another part of the Entertainment folder in SE W810. Using Bluetooth you can control the Media Player application or other programs on your computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HID profiles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VideoDJ is an internal application, which helps you modify and edit video records. PhotoDJ offers several tools for picture modifications; while MusicDJ helps you compose music of your own using several available samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  VideoDJ ? PhotoDJ ? MusicDJ</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W810 has a voice recorder, which can start recording even in the middle of an ongoing call. The opposite side is alerted of recording process by a beep sound every 20 seconds. Record duration is only limited by the free memory space available in the memory card. Sound is stored in AMR format and its quality is rather average.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>It is very probable that the mess caused by the absence of EDGE in the K750 model is going to substituted with the delight of all those who had waited so long for EDGE. In Sony Ericsson W810 they will find it in Class 10. Internet connection is also possible to be established via CSD and HSCSD, or GPRS Class 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I tested the data connection using a data cable. Setup went smoothly thanks to the PC Suite program guide. The phone announces standard connection speed of 115 kb/s, while the connection alone seems pretty stable. Part of SE W810 equipment is also an improved Web browser.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No objections to the colors used<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are hesitating, whether you should buy Sony Ericsson W800 or its successor W810, you should only really consider which color version you like best. The rest of the properties and the applications in these two phones are identical. Well, except EDGE, this is available in Sony Ericsson W810 only. I myself find W810 slightly more "plastic-looking" than the W800 model. Of course, this doesn't mean that its constructional qualities are worse, though. On the contrary! I just mean that the materials used in Sony Ericsson W810 both feel and seem to the eye a little bit less valuable.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>So what has Sony Ericsson W810 to offer - an excellent keypad with surprisingly good keys, a brilliant display, plenty of storage space and top-quality earphones that come in the original package with the phone. In addition, fast menu reactions and one of the best camera applications since photo mobiles first appeared on the market. On the other hand, W810 camera lens is not protected and the overall design of the phone is not as attractive as the one of the forerunner. In general, however, there are very few drawbacks that are worth mentioning, even though Sony Ericsson W810 is set on the constructional and design plans of the one-year old W800.</paragraph>
