			<paragraph>High megapixel count is the rage these days and Sony Ericsson C905 is adding fuel to the fire. The first 8 megapixel GSM cameraphone to make headlines is shipping as we speak. On top of geotagging, Smart Contrast, face detection, and xenon flash, the elaborate camera-centric outfit hides the extra sweet Wi-Fi, GPS and turn-by-turn voice guided navigation. Is it us, or are cameraphones and smartphones alike lining up to negotiate a truce with Sony Ericsson C905?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cyber-shot squad has its trustworthy captain and its job is to keep spirits high in the face of cut-throat competition by Samsung and LG. Is it just us, or isn't Nokia missing quite some action here?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 is no doubt trying to give it all. Now, finding room for all those goodies is a tough one indeed. Despite its massive thickness we love the C905 design and its imaging-related ergonomics. The impressive girth isn't that striking alongside the Pixon and will only get in your face against a real thin shooter like Sony Ericsson C902. You do get used to this in a while, and it's an enjoyable feature set after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 will be remembered as the first announced 8 megapixel GSM phone. That alone earns it a line in history but it's performance to decide if the line should become a chapter. By the looks of it, the Sony Ericsson team is going for a whole page, putting a great effort to dealing with the skeletons in the Cyber-shot closet. Now, that's about the closest it comes to a spoiler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the C905 is well aware it takes quite a bit to keep a bunch of sharpshooters off its back. Things have been heating up lately at ours, with the cameraphone finest scrambling and tail-wagging for a pat of approval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Outflanked and outnumbered, Sony Ericsson C905 finds itself right in the middle of the Samsung - LG brawl. Both LG and Samsung are hedging their bets with two 8 MP cameraphones each. The Symbian-powered Samsung i8510 INNOV8 flaunts a formidable spec sheet and already has a head start on the rest, selling for about a month. Samsung M8800 Pixon is the other Samsung offer we just recently reviewed in-depth. LG stake their cameraphone fortunes on KC910 Renoir and LG KC780.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK then, the scene is set and the all-star support cast will be enjoying a day-off. It's the Cyber-shot act and curtains are parting on Sony Ericsson C905.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Sony Ericsson C905<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 ships in a neat and simple box and the package contents are above the average. You get a charger, data cable, a simple non-detachable headset, 2GB M2 card, and extras as a wrist strap and a Sony Ericsson M2 USB adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you get the box in your hands, you'll be surprised how heavy it is. Well, that's because Sony Ericsson have put 4 user guides (each 80 pages) and 4 camera guides in different languages plus a CD and a SAR information booklet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we appreciate their effort to keep users informed, we couldn't help but wonder why the senseless waste of paper on tons of languages that we would never need. We don't want to sound petty, but this is by far the most paper-loaded retail box we've seen since our Canon office printer arrived couple of years ago.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson C905 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 measures 104 x 49 x 18 mm, but in the projecting camera section it's another 1.5 mm thicker. The hefty slider weighs 136 grams, which makes it second only to the INNOV8 with its 140 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and Construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 is almost entirely made of plastic with the padding of the top part of the slider that gets exposed the only metal element. The chrome-colored controls and the sliding lens color nicely contrast with the solid black surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the black bits of the casing have an extra soft rubbery finish for a great grip. The sides of the handset are brushed dark grey panels enclosed in a silver frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flatbed keypad keeps the same solid black styling that makes it quite consistent with the sliding front of the handset. While not exactly explicit high-end, the materials used on the C905 get appreciated for the practical and secure handling and resistance to fingerprints or dirt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 2.4" scratch-resistant TFT display dominates the front panel. Above it, an ambient light sensor shares a stylish silvery rack with the earpiece. There's no front facing video call camera here - the main camera is used for video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display a pair of shortcut keys encloses the earpiece frame. The manufacturer calls them gaming/photo keys but they have more of an imaging application. The right key starts the image gallery, while the left one is used for opening the latest image. Alternatively, in camera mode they light in blue and are used for toggling Scene and Shoot modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, an ample D-pad is sided by two columns of controls. Each is topped by a soft key, a bulging Call (left) and End key (right) in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom knobs are Shortcuts on the left and Clear key on the right. The styling of the navigation pad is quite elegant and the controls are adequately usable never mind their short stroke.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly the D-pad, though quite big, is way too rigid. We expected much better and solid press in such a big piece of hardware. And worst of all, the press feedback of the four directions of the D-pad differs quite a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 28 Nov: We got our hands on a final retail C905 unit. The D-pad is much better from the one of our pre-release unit. There are no issues with all the four directions and the tactile feedback is greatly improved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The confirm key on the other hand is quite responsive and tactile. In camera mode the D-pad gets some extra functionality and imaging-related controls backlight in blue. The direction keys on the D-pad are assigned to focus mode; exposure, flash control and self-timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone up reveals the flatbed alphanumeric keyboard with thin silvery ridges between rows for better touch orientation. Tactility is further improved by the slightly bulging rows of keys which - quite unexpectedly - results in tangible terracing. Key presses are marked by a distinct click and typing is quite trouble-free. Even the top row of keys isn't affected by the slider form factor and enjoys plenty of head room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft white keypad backlighting is strong and remarkably even. The D-pad backlighting has a bluish tint - an inevitable spillover from the alternative blue illumination in camera mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls on the sides of the D-pad backlight is soft and even white. Keypad locks automatically upon sliding the phone closed, and that's non-negotiable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson C905 features nothing but the regular Fast Port and the M2 memory card slot with protective cover. We wish the Fast port was sealed too: would've looked way better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset is the top side in digicam terms. It hosts the elevated volume rocker, which doubles as zoom lever when taking or browsing pictures, and all the camera controls. The two-position shutter key is a small but very tactile knob sunk in a bowl-shaped nest, to which your finger literally sticks. Halfway up the right side there are another couple of camera keys - the dedicated camera mode switch and the Gallery button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the phone is completely bare, while the bottom features the loudspeaker grill and lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside we find the brushed metal metal active lens cover. The lens cover itself is rather neat, however depending on where you rest your finger when sliding it open, you may often smudge your lens by accident.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C905 rear is extra slick with the stylish bulge of the lens deck a very subtle camera-centric touch. The lens cover does look great on the solid black background of the rear but we fear it may not be as sturdy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lens cover consists of two parts - when you slide to reveal the camera lens, the lower piece sinks to make room for the sliding bit. The lens cover feels somewhat thin and fragile and the constant rubbing of the two parts may result in excessive wear. There's a tangible wobble in both positions of the sliding lens cover, which we fear will deteriorate with use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the cover is open, the lens and all the entourage get revealed - there's xenon flash, self-portrait mirror, video light and video microphone. The video LED flash is also used as a focus assist beam in darker scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To release the battery cover you simply need to push down with your thumb. To do so though you have to first slide the handset up and use the alphanumeric keypad as a grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under it hides the Sony Ericsson BST-38 Li-Po battery, which has a capacity of 930 mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson commit to up to 380h of stand-by time and up to 9h of talk time. Unfortunately we can't comment on the real-life performance of the battery, but you can bet that with some intensive use of GPS and Wi-Fi, a spare battery may as well turn out essential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in conclusion, Sony Ericsson C905 handles nicely and the weight of 136 grams isn't a burden. The fingerprint resistance and the secure grip are more than welcome. As much as we appreciate the black and chrome finish and the subtle camera-centric styling, we can't overlook a couple of flaws.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slider action is somewhat spongy, and goes with an audible squeak, but that's minor stuff compared to the scratching and cracking produced by the top bit of the slider. It's just a minor wobble, which we would've let go in a slider, if it wasn't for the terrible squeaking any time you as much as brush it against your ear. This completely rules out taking calls with the slider down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 28 Nov: The slider action of the retail SE C905 is smooth and responsive and is superior to that of the pre-release C905 we reviewed initially. What's more, now there is no play or squeaking of the top part of the slider when you put the phone against your ear.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display: bigger and better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 employs a 2.4" 256K-color TFT display of QVGA resolution. Mineral glass coating ensures scratch resistance. The crystal-clear screen excels in both contrast and brightness. Dark colors are really dark. Sunlight legibility is better than your average Sony Ericsson mobile but still is far from perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing we love about this display is that it reflects almost nothing, even when it's blank in power-saving mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The latest user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi and built-in GPS aside, which are out of the feature phone world, at the core of Sony Ericsson C905 is the usual SE user interface with the latest styling tweaks. By the way, latest is by no means brand new and the C905 has nothing to outdo the former Cyber-shot top dog C902 or high-end Walkmans. By the way, Sony Ericsson have set up a nice little interactive tool here for you to explore the phone interface and features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing to mention is the main menu structure. Except the traditional 4 x 3 grid matrix, the main menu is perked up with a couple of alternative views: rotating and single icon view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating view shows three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden, just as an indication of what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar, which this time isn't a simple position mapping graphic but features tiny icons for the other main menu entries. Neither of those view modes works with shortcut keys. Only the Grid view allows quick numeric keypad access - a good enough reason to forget about the other options once you've tried them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other boost is icon animation, some transitions and visual effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As most previous models, the C905 has a dedicated Flight mode. When turning on the phone, you may opt to start it directly into Flight mode but the Sony Ericsson C905 cannot work in Flight mode unless a SIM card is inserted. The other irritating thing is that toggling the flight mode requires a reboot of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 supports Flash Lite themes, which change the color scheme and wallpaper. Our test handset had two themes preinstalled only, but we guess that there will be more on the retail C905 units.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C905 features the well-known Activity menu. The Running Apps tab of this menu offers basic multi-tasking - for example you can run two Java applications and in the same time listen to the radio or music player. The Activity menu also offers quick access to recent events, the web and My Shortcuts menu, which contains a user-defined list of shortcuts to favorite features.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Spacious phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 is equipped with a phonebook that can store up to 1000 entries with a total of 7000 phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. They are searched by gradual typing of the desired name. You can choose whether the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be displayed by default. Unfortunately, there is no option for displaying both lists simultaneously. The phonebook lets you auto save to SIM card any new contacts that you're adding to the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, the available details are distributed over five available tabs. The first is where you put the name and the numbers, the second holds email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture, custom ringtone, custom message tone and a voice command. The fourth goes for postal details. The last, fifth tab, is for making an additional note and adding a birth date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you enter a birthday, Sony Ericsson C905 prompts adding it to the calendar and setting a reminder, which we think, is a handy feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Smart Search completes the set of more important phonebook features. It looks up all the contacts whose numbers contain the digits you type on the stand-by screen. In addition, it also lists the names that start with the letters corresponding to the digits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. It is divided into four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to a single contact, only the last one gets recorded.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>C905 is handling calls trouble-free, no voice quality or reception issues. Earpiece sound is relatively loud and crisp. Here is how the Sony Ericsson C905 stacks up against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. Sadly, the integrated loudspeaker is an average performer. More info on our test and all current results can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging traditional<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson C905 offers the latest Sony Ericsson Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts, and the option to assign categories to messages. The Manage Messages application enhances message handling. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 handles all common types of messages, all of which - save for emails - share a common inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing a message, a warning is displayed when you exceed the 160-character limit, to let you know that the message will be divided in two (or more if necessary) parts for sending. There is also a rich T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since K850, you can opt to sort messages by category, provided you defined a specific category for each message. Six of them come preinstalled: Business, Favorites, Follow Up, Fun, Holiday, Important, but categories are fully customizable as well. If sorted by category, a big Inbox By Category tag appears instead of the standard small Inbox icon. Under it the categories are displayed but only the ones that contain messages are shown, which is convenient. You can also delete all messages in a given category. However, there is a glitch in the system - in the general inbox there is no indication if a message has been assigned a category. The same holds true for messages that are opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manage Messages feature, along with Categories, offers wide-ranging customization options and improved message handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also supports push email to boost mobile email usability. Emails are delivered in the background (similar to SMS or MMS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client in C905 supports dozens of settings and all types of encodings, just like some of the most advanced messaging devices out there. With high-speed data in focus with this handset, it's hardly a surprise. Sony Ericsson C905 can save attachments, no matter if they are supported or unknown file formats. Email messages can be sorted by size, date and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the phone is unable to handle any documents that are attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of a document reader. So the options are limited to plain text only and you should have that in mind if you're going for the C905.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final available options in the Sony Ericsson C905 email client are viewing a message fullscreen and changing the font size (small, medium, large). We did find them both quite handy.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flashy Media Center<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson are obviously trying to place more and more content and options in the media center. We appreciate their effort as we simply love the media interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 is equipped with Music Player 3.0, which is almost the same as the Walkman player 3.0 seen in Sony Ericsson W980. The player supports numerous file formats, including MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC +, WAV, WMA, M4A and MIDI plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player can naturally be set to run in the background. Sound is rich and crisp - as long you're using the player with a good headset, that is. If you are not willing to use the media player step-by-step structure, you can directly play a track through the file manager with its classic flat tree structure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player accommodated in the media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, while the interface is simple and stylish. The built-in accelerometer allows the video player to auto rotate. Again, the video files are accessible via the file manager but there you cannot opt to auto rotate the file, which we found a bit odd. Landscape mode can be set from the menu though. Fullscreen player mode and screenshot capability, are some cool extras in the player. You can save a frame of video and add it to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media center menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, RSS feeds and Settings icons. Along with the traditional functionality we've discussed in detail in several Sony Ericsson reviews, there is one extra icon for Games. The settings menu is simple - you may opt for portrait, landscape or auto rotate screen orientation, thanks to the integrated accelerometer sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first section in the Media Center is the Photo gallery. It consists of: Latest Photo, Camera Album, Photo Tags, Photo Feeds, and Pictures. Latest Photo provides quick access to most recent photos. Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year. When a month is open, it reveals a 4x3 grid of thumbs of photos. Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the corresponding month. The highlighted photo is a bit larger for better viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures section opens again as a 4x3 grid of thumbs with non-camera images, such as the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the full screen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Photo gallery is a powerful tool for conveniently managing a vast collection of camera photos with great customization capabilities. Photo Tags is a feature for displaying previously marked favorite photos. The Up key on the D-pad offers quick access to sending options like: send as Picture Msg, as email, to blog, via Bluetooth. Other than that, you can set a photo as wallpaper, screen saver, startup screen, and contact picture straight from the gallery. The well known Pan and Zoom and slideshow feature are also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, picture browsing via the classic file manager is still possible, but kind of pushed aside with the timeline view missing. This is quite a pity, in mind that T650 and K810 have it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PhotoDJ, videoDJ and musicDJ are also quite common features for all the Sony Ericsson phones, which are available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even beyond, yet extreme zooming in won't really reveal more detail. As usual with Cyber-shot phones, browsing full-res images didn't involve any lags at all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of Sony Ericsson C905 has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player but offers none of the fancy fullscreen graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is accessible through its original location in the entertainment menu. The service itself has seen several changes to include features like "Find similar Music", "Send music info via SMS", "TrackID charts" and a very extensive "Artist info" section.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>8.1 MP with nice Cyber-shot handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel power of the C905 is harnessed in the friendly and efficient interface, which we've known - and appreciated - across a number of high-end Cyber-shot handsets. While the handling and available features are well familiar, the camera quality is what caught us unprepared. Photos are so impressive we're tempted to suspect a complete revision of image processing. A minor fix just couldn't have brought such a boost in quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 MP AF camera in the C905 offers a wide range of features like face detection, camera images geotagging, smart contrast, exposure metering, image and video stabilizer, BestPic, auto-rotation, macro mode, red-eye reduction, Xenon and Photo Flash, etc. The C905 user guide claims a manual ISO setting with up to 400 ISO at hand, yet there is no sign of an ISO sub-menu in the camera interface of our test unit, which is a final hardware platform with the latest firmware version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 28 Nov: As we finally got a hold on of a retail C905 unit, we can confirm that the camera interface lacks any option for setting up the ISO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C905 is capable of maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels with average file size of about 2.5 MB. The lens is perfectly protected under the sliding cover and camera controls are very comfortable to use, especially the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises in the latest Cyber-shot interface. Settings on toolbar with pop-up submenus and the Multi Menu are well known since K850 and do help the user experience. The two photo keys over the display and the D-pad in camera mode give access to the most frequently used camera settings like focus mode, exposure, flash control, and self-timer. Traditionally, the viewfinder toolbar lets you control shoot mode, scenes, picture size, focus mode, flash, self-timer, exposure metering, white balance, effects, and settings (Multi menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two camera features are notable in the C905. We saw Face detection back in C902 as an extra setting in Focus mode. The face recognition system allows you to simultaneously track as many as 3 faces whereas focus is usually locked on the one that's closest to the center of the frame usually. Smart contrast is a new feature, which should be handy for heavily backlit scenes for example. We tested it and it does make a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image stabilizer is supposed to keep images from blurring in dark environments but, as in all phone cameras so far, it's purely a software tweak of questionable use. Plus, keeping it off can help if your subjects are moving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ultra quick-snapping BestPic mode has two varieties - fast and slow. In fast mode it produces 7 full-size 8 megapixel images for about 0.8 sec, while in slow mode takes 7 images again but in a longer interval of about 1.7 sec. Sadly, the xenon flash is unusable in any of the two modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a built-in GPS receiver Sony Ericsson C905 is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images. You can enable geotagging (Add position) from the settings to add GPS location data to your pictures. A flag icon at the bottom of the viewfinder indicates that the option is activated. A satellite icon in the top left corner is showing that the phone is attempting to get GPS lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With our pre-release unit only a few of our sample photos were properly tagged. Interestingly, the View on map option worked for all images, even those we thought failed with geotagging. So, we guess it's a bug that should've been fixed now that the phone is on the shelves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 28 Nov: The proper geo-tagging of images requires some time for the GPS to lock position. The successful lock is depicted by a set of green stripes in the upper right corner of the camera viewfinder (right next to the satellite icon). </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can of course speed up the process by enabling the Assisted-GPS function, but this would generating some extra data traffic on your account. So have that in mind if you want to use A-GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When browsing tagged images in the gallery, the View on map option displays the shows where the picture was taken directly on the preinstalled Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 has both Xenon and LED flash, the latter also used as a focus assist beam. The Xenon flash is a real asset but we were surprised to find no Always on option (unlike Samsung INNOV8). So, using a fill flash in backlit scenes is out of the question. Of course, Smart Contrast does a good enough job but it still would've been better to let users have a say. Another way to deal with the situation is metering mode at one or two steps of underexposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated macro mode in C905 allows you to take images from as close as 10 cm. The optional silent shutter is also among the worth-mentioning features. The other one is the built-in accelerometer, which lets you rotate the viewfinder or images in the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one shortcoming we found concerns the menu one-way layout - to reach the Multi Menu you have to pass all the other settings on the toolbar, as it's the last item there. Looped browsing of items on the toolbar should be an option, as with the camera interfaces of competing brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 seems to have undergone a complete rehash of the image processing algorithm. The photos have vibrant and balanced colors and very mild sharpening. Noise is kept to really comfortable values for a camera phone. Chromatic aberrations even in high-contrast or underexposed areas are well under control. The purple fringing has almost completely gone. C905 produces astonishingly fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson team must have put great effort to addressing those issues. We can conclude the C905 will be a tough contender and the shootout we're brewing for you will be a remarkably close match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, a picture is worth thousand words, so there we go with our collection of samples produced by Sony Ericsson C905.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there's a bunch of images downsized to 1024x768 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the C905 is also capable of capturing video, even if it's limited to QVGA resolution at 30fps. The clips are recorded in mp4 format and take about 3 MB for every minute of recording. Interestingly enough, the C905 camera is also officially quoted to record stereo sound to video clips, as was the Sony Ericsson C902.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browsing is a breeze<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 has the latest Access NetFront HTML browser 3.4. Elaborate web pages are rendered well and there are lots of configurable settings too. Although there is no dedicated fullscreen mode, the web page automatically rotates in landscape/full screen mode, if the phone is turned horizontally. The other view modes include Text only, Pan and Zoom and Zoom page. The Panning/scrolling speed is also up to the standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C905 web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer, which is a real pleasure to work with. Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option. It searches the loaded web page and the first match is immediately listed as soon as you type a letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If are still not satisfied with this browser, you can always count on the superb OperaMini browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-inclusive connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity options of C905 are full service. Quad-band GSM/HSCSD/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board, so there is virtually no spot on earth where you will be unable to connect. In addition, you've got the fastest data transfer around, provided that a HSDPA-enabled network is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100Mhz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should definitely check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, Sony Ericsson C905 offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options. There is also support for the A2DP profile allowing listening to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. The other major connectivity feature is the built-in Wi-Fi with DLNA support. GPS with A-GPS function completes the tally. Last, but not least, there is also the M2 card slot which might just turn out to be one of the quickest means of transferring data on some occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C905 supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC, while the remote synchronization works with remote servers. USB connectivity has four modes - one for file transfers and one for USB Internet - to put it simply, the second one is for using the phone as a modem. The third one is media transfer, which directly connects to the Windows media player, and gives full access to tracks placed on your phone, synchronization, play or sorting in playlists. The last one is for direct printing of images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than imaging prowess, the C905 is notable for completing the connectivity options with Wi-Fi. Unfortunately, as the official information goes, the maximum transfer rate via the Wi-Fi connection goes only up to 5 Mb/s (yes, that's megabits not megabytes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's integrated rather well in the user interface and quite user-friendly. Once you turn the Wi-Fi on, you get a list of the available wireless hot spots. Connecting is a matter of single click. It is also available via "My shortcuts", just in case you don't want to look for it in the menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser and all other data traffic is re-routed through the Wi-Fi connection by default, when you are connected. If Wi-Fi connection should fail, the browser automatically starts to use GPRS or higher speed network connection, if available. Of course you won't have to guess whether Wi-Fi is engaged or not, as it has an icon on the top status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto connect, Wi-Fi networks priority, and assigning a favorite network are among the nice and very practical features in the Wi-Fi interface. Additional settings allow you to search networks by their SSID, check your connection status or MAC address (you cannot change that).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tasks &amp; more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C905 offers a wide range of time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Applications, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Calculator, and Code memo. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar. Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages; the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms are part of the main menu. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the free memory available the only restriction. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the well known basic applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include MusicDJ and VideoDJ. VideoDJ is for making your own video clips by mixing already existing ones with still pictures, text and a variety of effects or for making basic cuts using special transitions and adding background music. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Location services and knowing your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Available for free download and compatible with a variety of mobile OS and Java-enabled handsets, the Google Maps for Mobile come preinstalled in the C905. With Location services you can get help finding your way, view information about your current location and save your favorite locations. To use all features of the Location services internet access is a must.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After defining a start and end location, the possible routes are being calculated with overall guidance, based on the available information in the database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two different view modes are available - Satellite and Map view. Traffic information is another important feature here. The user interface is nice and intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tthe Status info application displays the current activity in km/h for a 60 minutes period. GPS connection status is indicated on the second tab of this application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, saving your most recent routes is as easy as it could be. Within several clicks, a title, description and position is all you need to save a favorite location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Log application in the Location services tracks and saves each position request, which is accessible at any time afterwards. Each entry in the log is saved in descending order by date and displays the date and time, as well as the exact GPS position.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wayfinder Navigator 7 navigation software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wayfinder Navigator 7 is the real deal navigation software but in previous Sony Ericsson models it offered time-limited trial turn-by-turn navigation and then required a paid monthly subscription. We guess the situation with the C905 won't be much different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Route planning is extensive, there's pedestrian mode, as well as the option to avoid toll roads. Routes can be optimised for either stime or distance. You are allowed to choose among tree modes of voice prompts: complete, fewer or none.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other navigation modes are 2D map, guide and automatic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Overview map with day and night modes is also onboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The game section houses three accelerometer based games - Need for Speed ProStreet, Kasparov Chess and Tennis Multiplayer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Need for Speed has a cool 3D interface and is quite entertaining. And what's worth noting, your NFS car can be steered with both the D-pad and the built-in accelerometer function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two games are Kasparov Chess and Tennis Multiplayer. The classical Chess game has very good graphics. The Tennis we liked less.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, there's a beast of a Cyber-shot at large, so you'd better watch out. Sony Ericsson C905 is already in the hands of the first users and for all we know they should be quite happy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice camera-centric styling and solid interface are the right place to start exploring and enjoying a wealth of talent. Indeed, it's a feature set that built-in GPS and Wi-Fi make really hard to resist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The outstanding camera performance gives the C905 all the reasons to hope for a meaningful and rewarding run. Some minor built quality concerns and inadequate video recording seem easily outweighed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, all of that is more than reassuring if you look at the latest Cyber-shot on its own. But it may get well painful in that small but steep 8-megapixel food chain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point we know the C905 as more affordable than the INNOV8 but that's more or less offset by storage, the larger display and the Symbian blood. With LG KC910 Renoir and Samsung M8800 Pixon poised to take off, it soon won't matter that INNOV8 and C905 drew first blood.</paragraph>
