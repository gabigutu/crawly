			<paragraph>A straight no-nonsense handset, LG KE500 blends clean styling with decent multimedia. It doesn't pretend to outShine and outsweet its haughty siblings, but still has enough to offer: neat sliding design, a 2 MP camera, memory card slot and FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The South Korean maker has always put special emphasis on design. The new mid-tier LG KE500 is an attempt to cater to budget-minded, yet style-sensitive mobile users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Silver all over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new LG KE500 has an all-silver body standing at 97 x 47 x 15 mm and weighing 90 g. Save for the pleasing metal-like framing of the display, the front panel is quite subtle and inconspicuous. After all, we can't expect flames and flares in a mid-range handset. The fingerprint-proof plastic parts of the phone are a definite advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset construction elicits no exclamations and no major disappointments. In open position, the upper sliding part has a certain wobble, both vertical and horizontal, but it's not likely to ruin your experience with the handset. The spring-loaded case slides open without much effort. A bulging brow at the top of the D-pad, right beneath the frame of the display, provides a nice pushing surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the classic alphanumeric keyboard and the D-pad, a few controls are placed on the sides of the handset. On the left side are the volume rocker and, a further up, the lanyard eyelet. On the right is where you'll find the camera shutter key and the Red Receiver / Power button. This isn't a new layout for LG. We've seen it in KG800 Chocolate. Above those two controls is the protective cap of the universal port for connecting the charger, data cable and headphones (positioned again as in LG Chocolate). The top and bottom part of the handset feature no controls and elements whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the space rearside is taken by the battery, which serves as a back panel. It's easily removed upon pressing the release button. The battery is Li-Ion with a capacity of 800 mAh. It's quoted at 210 minutes of talk time or 200 hours in stand-by. In reality it would last you around 3 days. The SIM card bed is under the battery. To the right of the battery release key is the microSD card slot. Regretfully, it's only accessible with the battery removed. No memory card is shipped with the handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Blue circle D-pad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG engineers have done a good job with the D-pad. Its focal element is a round four-way navigation key enclosed in a circle, which backlights in blue. At the sides of the navigation dial are a pair of soft keys, the dial key and the correction C key. Regardless of the touch-sensitive feel they give out, the entire foursome are just regular hardware keys. The red receiver key on the side would be utterly impractical to use in navigating the menu, so you'll end up pressing it to end calls only. Still, you'll need some time getting used to its location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keys have low stroke and ample size. Slightly bulging in the middle, they offer sufficient touch orientation. Typing is very comfortable. Every keypress is marked by a click, which is a tad louder than necessary, and may be disturbing in quiet environments. The keypad won't automatically lock upon sliding the phone closed, but can be set to autolock when idle over a certain period. Keypad backlighting is even and saturated, with a pleasing blue color.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display in the mirror<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KE500 is the first handset of the South Korean manufacturer to feature the Mobile XD Engine technology. It was originally developed to improve contrast in LCD TV sets. Not much of a difference is noticeable, anyway. LG KE500 has a 2" 262K-color TFT display of a 176 x 220 pixel resolution. Given the resolution, imaging is a touch coarse, but by all means passable in day-to-day use. In the display settings you can adjust brightness and set the backlight timer. The display is covered by a protective glass, which can serve as a mirror in stand-by mode. Fingerprints are painfully visible on both the display and the shiny frame around it. In direct sunlight, the display is totally illegible, obviously a downside owing to the mirror finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In standby mode, when the backlighting turns off, the screen is completely blank, and you'll need to power your device up to check status and missed events.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Menu-go-round<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface and the overall operation of the device are easy to master. In standby mode, an animated SWF wallpaper can serve as the display background. The screen displays the usual status info, time and date, as well as the functions assigned to the soft keys (if you choose so). A text note can also be set to display on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is accessed through a press on the confirming center of the D-pad or, alternatively, by pressing the left contextual key. The right soft key launches the phonebook. The main menu contains nine icons, which can be arranged in a classic grid or, quite originally, viewed in a circle: the so-called Wheel view. The main menu is animated: in grid view, icons jiggle briefly when selected. The icon design is somewhat of a letdown. Icons have little color and do look dull and inexpressive. Submenus are classic numbered lists, scrolled using the Up and Down keys. Numeric keypad shortcuts are enabled when browsing the menu. Throughout the menu you get white text and icons on a blue background. An alternative color scheme is not available. Navigating the menu is quick and intuitive; response to user commands is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick access grid, the so-called Home Screen Shortcut, on the standby display tips on the functions assigned to the navigation keys. The shortcuts are preset and can't be modified. The only choice the user is given is whether to display the quick access grid in standby, or not. The Left key on the D-pad opens the ringing profiles, Up starts the message editor, Down launches phonebook, and Right takes you to the Favorites menu, where users can store up to 12 frequently used functions.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two megapixel with LED<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KE500 offers a 2 megapixel camera. The lens is at the back of the slider, safely sheltered when the handset is in closed position. Next to the lens are the LED flash and self-portrait mirror. The maximum picture size attainable is 1600 x 1200 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera viewfinder doesn't take the whole display. The settings appear in a toolbar at the bottom of the screen. The options available for each feature appear in a pop-up menu, allowing the user to set resolution and picture quality, turn flash on and off, set self timer, define saving preferences, use burst (multi shot), apply color effects, set white balance and choose shutter sound (they can be turned off in our unit). The camera offers also exposure compensation and 4x digital zoom. The pictures can be saved in the phone memory (55 MB) or on a memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture quality is average. Color rendering is good, but the amount of noise is considerable. Text reads OK regardless of the lack of autofocus. The camera can also record video in 3GP format at a maximum resolution of 176 x 144 pixels. Recording length is unlimited, depending on the available memory only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample pictures taken with LG KE500:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images, along with the rest of the multimedia content, are stored in the My Stuff directory. Files are stored by type and can be rearranged and moved to user-added folders. Images can be viewed one by one or in a slide show. File info is also available. Images can be set as wallpaper, sent via Bluetooth or MMS, copied or moved. The handset responds rather slowly when browsing pictures.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook stores up to 1000 multi-entry contacts. Each contact can have up to 4 phone numbers, an email address, a picture and a ringtone. A memo and anniversary can be stored too, and synced with the calendar. Contacts can also be arranged in groups. The phonebook offers three view options: Names only, Name and number and With picture. Contacts are searchable by gradual typing, both SIM and phone contacts are listed simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handsfree calls are enabled using the loudspeaker. Up to half a minute of each call can be recorded. The LG KE500 works in GSM networks at 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz. UMTS is not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode is available, along with four ringing profiles, allowing customization of alert type, ringing volume, keypad tones and volume, slide tone, etc. The icon of the currently active profile is constantly displayed on the home screen. MP3, VAW, ACC and AMR files can be set as ringtones, and 40-tone polyphony is supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bluetooth texting too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KE500 supports text and multimedia messaging. There's no email client (some LG web sites state email functionality, but our unit had none). Text messages are composed and viewed in seven lines. A T9 dictionary is at hand. Counters alert of the number of characters left and the chunks a message will break down to. EMS is also supported, allowing you to insert smilies, monochrome images and sounds. Multiple number sending is also available, each SMS can have up to five addressees. The user available memory allows storing up to 110 text messages. Custom incoming SMS alerts are impossible to set; only four presets are available to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images, sound, video, as well as contact and calendar entries can be inserted in multimedia messages. MMS size is limited to 300KB. A preview allows you to control the message and its contents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KE500 supports sending text messages via Bluetooth. Not all handsets however support the TXT format. Bluetooth messages use the same editor as SMS but have a dedicated inbox.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Getting organized<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizing capabilities of the LG KE500 are quite adequate. The main feature within the Tools menu is the Calendar, with its default Month view. Only one type of event can be scheduled but repeat is enabled and custom alerts can be set using all sound files available. A task application is also available (To Do); tasks can be assigned priority and marked off upon completion. Each To-do entry can have a note of up to 80 symbols. Additionally, Memos can also be saved. The maximum number of To-dos and Memos stored is 50. Synchronization with Outlook is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of alarm slots is more than sufficient. Five are available, each can be assigned a title, repeat pattern and custom alert. All set alarms will appear on the standby display and will go off even if the phone is turned off. The FM radio can also be used as an alert. Other available functions are stopwatch with mean times, calculator, unit converter and world clock. The voice recorder gives you half-minute voice memos.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Adaptive headphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For quite a long time the music player was unjustly suspected of being unable to play in the background. It was an accidental press on the shutter key when the player was on, that cleared all suspicion. Yes, pressing the camera key minimizes the player. The supported formats are MP3, WAV and AAC. Tracks are arranged by name, disregarding ID3 tags and you may create your own playlists. The player offers two skins, six equalizer presets, along with shuffle and repeat mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard inclusion headset was a real cheer. The 3.5mm jack adapter is always welcome. Aside from the volume control, the wired headset also features a mouthpiece and a pad for answering calls. The headset, which ships with the phone, offers passable sound experience but is a bit uncomfortable and fell off my ears ever too often. The 3.5mm jack adapter however will resolve that issue, making the LG KE500 compatible with any headphones. The Bluetooth-enabled KE500 supports the A2DP profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music capabilities of LG KE500 are enhanced by the FM radio. It stores up to 12 stations upon auto scan. The radio doesn't feature RDS and can't be minimized to play in the background. A simple video player adds to the media tally. It supports 3GP and MPEG-4 formats. Videos can be fast-forwarded, but can't be stretched full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KE500 offers a single preinstalled Java game - Sudoku. It's up to the users to expand their Java content.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>With EDGE on the web<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfer technologies featured are GPRS ? EDGE, both class 10. The old-school CSD connectivity is also available. Data can also be transferred via Bluetooth and using the enclosed data cable. When the handset is connected to PC, two working modes are available: Phone mode and Mass Storage. The phone is charging when connected. The retail package offers a CD with software: for PC sync, for using the handset as a modem and for transferring music.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Middling Browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KE500 has an integrated WAP browser. It offers bookmarks and the option to disable images. Up to 12 lines of text are displayed on the screen when browsing. Upon closing the browser, you'll always get a count of the data transferred.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Affordable and decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KE500 leaves quite a positive impression. This affordable device offers discreet style and reasonable multimedia capabilities. It seems a proper choice for balancing neat looks and affordability. LG KE500 is miles apart from the extrovert and glamorous Shine, and for some people this is a downright advantage. The accessories are quite pleasing too, especially the 3.5mm adapter. There seem to be enough competitive handsets to offer extra features like voice commands and email for the same price. Still, the LG KE500 should be enjoying a good enough demand. If you are really on a budget you may also consider the Samsung E250 which offers pretty much the same functionality (music player, FM radio, memory card slot, nice menu system, decent battery life) but with poorer quality displays and built-in VGA cameras.</paragraph>
