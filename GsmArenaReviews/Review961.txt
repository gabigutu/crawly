			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphone makers believe in trickle-down economics. They build their portfolios top to bottom, looking to get as much bang out of the flagship as they can and, after the hype around it has settled, they bring out the more affordable packages to keep the cash rolling in. The big question - always - is how much of the flagship specs will trickle down the ranks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having delivered the latest BlackBerry 10 OS in a classic messenger form factor, a midrange package combining touchscreen with the iconic hardware keyboard was next on the Canadians' to-do list. The Q10 came at a price not a lot of people can afford, so the Q5 promises to deliver the same experience without sweeping the fluff out of your pocket.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the BlackBerry Q5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 ships in a relatively compact box that contains all the essential accessories. There's a USB cable that you use for PC tethering or charging with one of the two AC adapters. It's really nice of BlackBerry to have users covered for both the continental and UK power supply standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a cheapish looking headset and some leaflets in the package. A microSD card is missing but the 8GB of internal memory should be enough as a start.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Q5 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 is virtually identical to the BlackBerry Q10 at 120 x 66 x 10.8 mm, compared to 119.6 x 66.8 x 10.4 mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 is lighter though, at 120g, than its premium sibling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The smartphone certainly lacks the sophistication of the Q10 and even though the plastic used is of decent quality, it's nowhere near as solid or good looking as on the Q10. Cost-cutting was obviously not limited to the internals - the build and finish were affected too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like all things BlackBerry, the styling of the Q5 is respectful of tradition. The spaced-out QWERTY keyboard takes after the Curves, as opposed to the tightly-packed, molded keys of the Bold series - and the Q10. It's a cleaner, simpler design but not as good looking. Quite unexpected for a BlackBerry handset, the back gives slightly in when pressed harder, producing mild squeaks mostly around the shared SIM/microSD slot. The flap covering the slot feels a bit flimsy itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, it would be unfair to the BlackBerry Q5 to only compare it to a clearly premium device like the Q10, which is also one of the handsomest smartphones around. In more general terms, the Q5 is average looking at the very least and certainly not a smartphone you'd be embarrassed to be seen with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's back is nicely curved for comfortable handling. The finish is as good as immune against fingerprints and provides for a great, secure grip. It is a well-built device overall, except for the card slot flap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 QWERTY keyboard uses the same four-row layout as the one on the BlackBerry Q10, but has the typical Curve styling, with slightly smaller but better spaced keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys themselves aren't as pleasant to press on the BlackBerry Q5. They're sitting a little too low and have a rather short stroke. They're almost flat too, compared to the sculpted buttons on the Q10, which takes away some of the tactility and, in turn, the speed and/or accuracy of typing. The company has chosen to stick with the traditional numpad layout at one of the sides of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Q5 has more screen bezel at the bottom - the BlackBerry logo is between the keyboard and the display, rather than on top near the earpiece. That's one thing that works better than on the Q10. When swiping up from the bottom of the screen, the Q10 doesn't provide a comfortable starting point, while the Q5 does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best thing about the BlackBerry Q5 keyboard is that, just like on the Q10, it works with the touchscreen, rather than being at odds with it. With plenty of shortcuts available, most of which should be familiar to experienced BlackBerry users, the keyboard can seriously speed up getting around the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instant Actions makes the right kind of difference too, letting you launch apps and perform tasks using search as you type interface. But we'll look at that in more detail in the software part of this review - for now we'll just say that the Q5 is a fine texting device, even if slightly worse than the Q10.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now let's explore the rest of the BlackBerry Q5 controls. Above the screen, we find the traditional status LED, proximity sensor and the earpiece. The front facing camera on the Q5 is a 2MP unit that can do 720p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the BlackBerry Q5 features the volume controls, with a small pause/mute button squeezed in between. The convenience key, a token of the old days, is gone along with the trackpad and call buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset is where the two slots, for SIM and microSD cards, are located. Those are hidden under a small plastic flap which isn't really perfectly designed as it got stuck a couple of times under the back panel and we had to push hard against the back of the BlackBerry Q5 to release it. The other element of interest on the left is the microUSB port, which is left exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio port and the power/lock key are at the top of the BlackBerry Q5, flanking the secondary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom houses the loudspeaker grille and the mouthpiece. It's an unusual position for a speaker but one that makes sure you doesn't get muffled when the phone's resting on its back. Not sure about pockets though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel camera lens and a LED flash are the main attraction at the back. We like the fact that all the mandatory labels such as the FCC ID are printed on a sticker than you can remove, so it doesn't spoil the looks of the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the back panel of the BlackBerry Q5 is non-removable, meaning you don't get access to the 2,180 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the BlackBerry Q5 scored a very nice 55-hour endurance rating in our real-life battery test. The small screen and the energy-efficient chipset must be getting the credit for the solid performance. Find the complete breakdown here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 uses a 3.1" IPS LCD screen of 720p resolution (720 x 720 pixels). The pixel density clocks in at 328 ppi, which is slightly higher than the Galaxy SIII's screen and about the same as the iPhone 4S/5's Retina display. This means everything on the screen is nicely sharp and you can easily make out very fine text in your documents or web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Q5 vs Apple iPhone 5 screen matrices</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transition from AMOLED to IPS LCD has cost the BlackBerry Q5 somewhat in terms of contrast, but colors are still pretty great and viewing angles are very decent, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is average, as testified by the BlackBerry Q5's performance in our dedicated test.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gesture-based BlackBerry OS 10.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 is powered by BlackBerry OS 10.1, which we tested on its bigger brother, the Q10. The only noticeable difference is the switch to a light theme (the Q10 used an OLED-friendly dark theme instead).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 10.1 version brings along various optimizations over the initial BB10 release, as well as a bunch of new features - HDR stills, PIN-to-PIN messaging, customizable notifications, click a number to call, Instant Actions in the Universal Search app, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll cover the whole BlackBerry 10.1 OS ticking inside the Q5 smartphone completely, so don't worry if you still haven't caught up with the Canadians' OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of inspiration, the new BB OS feels like it has incorporated bits and pieces of WebOS and MeeGo - swipes and backgrounding - but also Android (some contextual menus) and iPhone (the rich elaborate graphics). Only the icon design and some deeper system menus allow but a mere glimpse into the BlackBerry of old. Not that the comfort of loyal users was of utmost importance. You just can't expect to feel right at home in an OS that skips from v7 straight to v10, can you?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not rush it then - check out the BB 10 in action running on the Q5 here:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>To unlock the Q5, you can use the Power/Lock button or swipe up from the bottom of the screen (it's important to note that swipes start off the screen). Interestingly, a single swipe will unlock the phone even if the screen is off. It's a unique feature - no need to wake up the device first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's up to you to decide whether you just want to check out notifications on the lockscreen, without unlocking the phone, or unlock the device and go straight to what you were doing. A short swipe is the Blackberry equivalent of MeeGo's double-tap-to-wake-up. A longer swipe will unlock - and it's not too hard to get the hang of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen itself shows a good deal of info - the time and date, the next event in your calendar, message counters and there's a camera shortcut. A swipe down from the top launches a dim, red clock - great in the dark since it doesn't hurt your eyes with bright light. A tap on the screen brings up the option to set an alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry 10 homescreen consists of multiple panes, two of which have a special purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer takes up most of the homescreen panes - it's a paged grid of shortcuts of all installed apps. A long press on an icon starts edit mode, which lets you rearrange icons and uninstall apps with a single tap (deleting obviously works only for non-system apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, on the homescreen you can initiate a search by just typing something on your keyboard. The search is pretty awesome and will look through your apps, messages, contacts, music, pictures and even offer Extend search, which continues the search in a selected app (e.g. Google Maps, Bing, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you have at least one app running, a special pane appears to the left of the app drawer panes. It holds up to eight "active frames" (similar to the WebOS cards), each of which is (typically) a thumbnail of a running app. Not all frames are just a downsized screenshot of the app, some switch to something more informative. For example, the Phone app switches to a list of recent calls, which is big enough to read comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frames are arranged chronologically and have a small x button when you don't need them any longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between apps is done with the same swipe up gesture used for unlocking the phone. No matter where you are in the interface, it will bring you to the task switcher page. One thing to note here is that as you swipe up and the current app is pushed into the background, a message counter appear on the left of the screen, showing unread message count for the various messaging services you have setup on the Q5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is Peek - named that because it lets you check new incoming messages with minimum interruption. If the message doesn't seem important, you can bring your finger back down and you will return to the current app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If just the message source isn't enough to tell whether it is important enough, you can continue swiping to the right. This continuous L-shaped swipe (up, then right) will push the current screen off to the side, revealing BlackBerry Hub. This is BlackBerry 10 new unified inbox, which contains all your messages from all email and social network accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing your finger will drop you into the Hub to read the message, or you can just reverse the gesture and go back to working within the current app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Hub is always the leftmost pane on the homescreen and can be accessed either by the swipe-up-then-right gesture or by tapping the small indicators at the bottom of the screen. Those immediately take you to the respective pane. You can swipe your finger over them to quickly scroll through all homescreen panes if you're not sure where to find the thing you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get back to Hub in a moment - it's the heart of BlackBerry 10 and perhaps the strongest weapon against competing OSes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one more important swipe gesture that will come in use often - a swipe from the top. This has two functions. On the homescreen it brings out a dropdown, hosting all sorts of quick toggles (Settings, Rotation lock, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Alarm and Notifications). When you are in an app, it brings out an app-specific list of options (think Menu key in Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's a handy way to replace a dedicated Menu button, though things are a bit inconsistent and some apps do have a menu button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Another issue is that quick toggles are only accessible on the homescreen, so you have to exit the current app if you want to switch Wi-Fi on, for example. This defeats the purpose of quick toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry 10.1 update allows to customize the notifications for each app - you can set the tone, switch vibration and the LED alerts on/off based on the account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 packs a Snapdragon 4 chipset with a 1.2GHz dual-core processor and 2GB of RAM. The BB 10 OS has been tailor-made for this hardware (or vice-versa) and everything is fast and fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.1" screen is very responsive and doesn't miss taps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get used to all the swipe gestures, BB 10 OS can be fast to operate, but the problem is getting there in the first place. It's a problem we think Windows 8 has too - without an obvious UI element (e.g. a button), a user will have to interact with invisible things that only come to the fore when you do the right gesture. BlackBerry will have a hard task of educating its users about these not-so-obvious gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the swipe down for quick toggles -or- app options (which may be elsewhere) wasn't confusing enough, the Hub makes it even more confusing. But we'll get to that later on in the Messaging section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, once we got used to those, the gestures get pretty intuitive. So much so in fact that we found ourselves swiping up on other phones, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Balance for corporate users<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Balance requires BlackBerry Enterprise Services to run, but once enabled it will split the apps on the phone into two - personal and work apps. Files created within work apps are AES256-encrypted and not accessible by personal apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between work and personal apps is done by swiping down in the app drawer and picking one of the two modes. The separation between work and personal files however means that you might have to download apps twice if you want to use them both for work and play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're using your own personal BlackBerry Q5 for work, the IT department can set up what apps will install automatically on the device and what email accounts will be added. They can remotely wipe the work data in Balance too (when you leave the company or lose your phone), but personal data remains intact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Voice commands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice commands are all the rage these days, everybody's got them and so does BlackBerry. It's not smart like Google Voice Search or a character like Siri, but the Voice Command app on the BlackBerry Q5 is still fairly usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can ask it to call someone, send them an email or text or BBM, schedule an appointment or leave yourself a note. Other options include searching the phone or the Internet and you can update your social networking accounts too - tweet, post a new Facebook status or LinkedIn status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app cannot answer questions or tell jokes, which are two of the most commonly used extra features of voice assistants. More importantly, it can't change settings (like toggling Wi-Fi on/off) or launch apps (there isn't even any integration with the native BB10 maps application).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerrys were the phone of choice for business users and they have to deal with tons of messages - so the interface has to be very efficient. And the new BlackBerry Hub is as efficient as they come. Perhaps only Windows Phone is close when it comes to unified messaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hub is pretty simple at first glance - a list of messages with an icon that indicates the service (SMS, BBM, email, Twitter or Facebook, PIN, but also calls and voicemails) and also flags messages read or unread (color icons are for unread messages, monochrome icons are for read messages). Messages are indexed by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you start scrolling the list of messages, the bottom bar temporarily disappears to give more screen real estate to the messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tap on a message to read it and you can respond to that message from the same screen too. That's great, because you don't have to worry about where a message came from, you just type a response and it will be sent back via the proper channel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the list of messages is too much of a mess, there's Search or you can swipe right to reveal a list of all services that feed messages into the Hub. You can then filter messages by service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's where the whole swiping business starts to get a little confusing. First, the Hub can also show you your agenda - swipe down to view it. But make sure the swipe starts from inside the screen (think "pull down to refresh" on iPhone). If you start from above the screen, the gesture will bring up the quick toggles instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not the end of it either - a right swipe leads you to the list of all services piped into Hub, a swipe left (or tap on the right side of the screen) brings you back to Hub. BUT if you start the swipe from the just outside the right side of the screen, you might end up in the task switcher pane instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Confused yet? There's a more refined way to filter Hub - the down arrow in the top right corner. Using this interface, you can search for individual folders (e.g. Inbox, Outbox, Missed calls, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a menu button in the lower-right corner of Hub, which brings out some handy options like Scroll to top (or bottom), search, compose, refresh, select multiple. You already have Search and Compose buttons at the bottom of the screen, but the others can be useful too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message management skills of the Hub don't end there - a long press on a message brings out a long list of options on the right. You can "drag" a message to one of these options in the same gesture or lift your finger and tap the option you like, whatever seems easier. The three vertical dots button expands the pane with options to include labels, not just icons - you'll need that at first, until you learn what icons stand for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More than one message can be selected here, but if you select messages from different sources, only the options that apply are displayed (e.g. you can mark both emails and tweets as "unread", but you can't tag tweets, only emails). The multi-select can be used for mass delete, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messaging is handled by the BlackBerry Hub - the Text Messages shortcut in the app drawer just leads to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're covering texting in more detail because it's supposed to be a primary use for one of the rare phones with a hardware QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages are organized into threads and use speech bubble layout. Both threads and individual messages can be managed by using the long press gesture. You can name a conversation thread, which will help you find it easier later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is no different than on other OSes. The text input area is quite small - it starts off as a single line and grows to only four, so composing longer texts can become a bit awkward. There's no character or message part counters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multimedia and other data (contact info, appointment even generic files) can be attached to the message, turning it into MMS. There's an option to attach a location (either your current location or point on a map) to the message, which is great for giving directions. More than one item can be attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Messenger is one of the hottest features on BB phones. At the base level, BBM can do text and voice chats (over your mobile data connection or Wi-Fi). You can attach multimedia content to a BBM message, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Q5 runs the latest OS, which also adds BBM Video - video calling with a twist. The twist, as you might know, is that instead of footage from the front-facing camera, the phone shares its own screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way the other party sees just what you see - a great way to show someone how to do something, walk them through a document or anything else you can think of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry will be porting the BlackBerry Messenger to Android and iOS, which surely means a huge expansion of its user base (but it would no longer be an exclusive feature).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 has no hardware call buttons, so the quickest way to call someone is to start typing their name or phone number on the keyboard and tap on the contact when the Search feature finds it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get to the dialer, tap the Phone shortcut in the bottom left corner (it's visible on all homescreen panes but the Hub). The dialer has three tabs - Calls, Contacts and Dial pad. We were a little disappointed to find out that you can't swipe between those three (after all, you can swipe between almost anything else).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer has been pushed to third place because it's not very useful - you have a powerful hardware QWERTY keyboard and your contacts are just a few quick clicks away. Furthermore the virtual dialer has no smart dial, you have to enter the number manually. There is a feature called "Smart dialing" but it's not the usual "search as you type" thing. Instead, it only automatically applies country and area codes to the numbers you dial (which is useful in roaming).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice option for those still using cellphone holsters is the option to automatically answer and hang up when taking the Q5 out of the holster and putting it back in again. Leave it to BlackBerry owners to still use holsters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, you're better off using the Contacts tab. It's a list of contacts sorted alphabetically. There's a search field - you don't need to look for it, just start typing with your hardware keyboard and the Search will do its job. A tap on a contact expands into a list of all assigned phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log features three shortcuts on top - Voice Mail plus three contact numbers. You can add more quick-dial numbers here, but the more you add, the further down the actual call log gets pushed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log itself displays either all calls or just missed calls (there's a toggle). Calls are grouped together to save space, e.g. two outgoing calls to the same contact are displayed as one item with a call counter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook looks a lot like the Contacts tab of the phone app, it also has a search field and it is also automatically activated when you start typing with the keyboard. Tapping on a contact here brings you to the contact info, which is split into three tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first tab is details - this is where all the phone numbers, email accounts, URLs, birthday and other info (including Facebook friends and Twitter followers count) are listed. If the same contact uses multiple services, you can link the entries and have everything in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is Updates. All social networking updates are listed here chronologically, along with automatically generated entries under the Company News heading. If you've entered a company name (or the phone can guess it from the social networking accounts associated with this contact), the phone will search the web for new relevant content and give you a four line preview. A neat feature for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab is Activity, a list of phone calls and messages between you and the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like in the Hub, you can swipe right to view a list of all services that provide contacts - your phone, the SIM card in it, BBM and BBM Video, Gmail, Twitter, you name it. You can use this to browse contacts coming from a specific service only or go into the settings to hide contacts from services you don't need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another trick from Hub is the long press - this gives you an easy access to several options straight in the contact lists. It's especially quick if you do it as one gesture (press and hold on a contact then move your finger to the option and release).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 has a louder ringer than the Q10, which combined with vibration you shouldn't be missing any calls. You can read about how the loudspeaker test is done here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File Manager with Dropbox and Box integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The File Manager is there for more advanced file browsing needs. It shows the internal and external storage as either a grid or list of files and folders. You can sort them by name, date, type and size in either ascending or descending order and if you still can't find what you need, there's the search feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 10 imposes a strict structure at the root level of the internal storage - folders are predefined and you can't change them. Inside those folders and on the external storage (microSD card), you're free to organize folders as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files and folders can be moved, copied and deleted in bulk, renamed or even zipped up into a single file and then unzipped (sending multiple files is easier if they are in a single file).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch between the internal and external storage, you do the same swipe right gesture used to filter items in the Hub and Contacts apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is cloud-enabled too, you can add Box and Dropbox accounts. They are treated almost the same way as a microSD card, so copying files between phone and cloud storage is seamless. There's no search option here (but you can still sort folders).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding those cloud accounts happens through external apps (Box and Connect to Dropbox), which is a bit clunky. These apps show the time of the last sync, your storage usage and have a toggle to disable syncing over mobile data (great if you don't have a solid data plan). The Box app also has toggles to automatically upload photos and videos to the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One potential problem with this app is that it only supports one account from each service. To be fair, so do the official desktop clients for these services. Still, it's worth noting if you're one of the few people who keep multiple accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you switch away from the Manager, its active frame changes to show memory usage on the various storage locations, giving you handy at-a-glance info.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Easy to use image gallery with powerful options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery app has a simple three-tab interface. The first is Recent and it displays recently added and recently viewed images (each list gets half of the screen, but you can tap the down arrow to expand them). The second tab is for photos shot with the BlackBerry Q5 and the third is for albums, which shows all folders with images on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple images can be selected at once for mass delete and mass share. There are also options to edit the image, start a slideshow or use DLNA to push images to a compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing individual images gives you the same options. You can move between images by swiping the current image past the edge left or right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Edit option in the gallery app is pretty powerful. The Transform tab in the editor can rotate and flip the image and there's a free transform tool as well if you want to crop out a specific part of the image. Then there's Enhance with the standard image tweaking options available (brightness, contrast, sharpness, noise reduction and so on), each with a slider for adjustments. There's a simple Auto-enhance option if you don't want to waste time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final two tabs are Artistic and Styles, which pretty much do the same thing - add Instagram-like effects to the image (everyone's favorite Lomo, Sepia and Aged photo effects). There's a cool animation that shows the effect sliding up on the image, giving you a second to preview the current and the new look side by side.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player is quite capable, the screen is not fit for video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 comes with a surprisingly capable video player. Its interface is very similar to that of the image gallery. It has three tabs - Recent, Camera and Library (which shows all video files stored on the phone) - and can display items either as a list or a grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search for a video, mass delete videos, share them or push them over DLNA to a compatible player. The Q5 doesn't have an HDMI port like the Q10, so you have to make do with DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video handled all the popular file formats but MKV and 1080p videos easily. Video Codec support is pretty great too - DivX, XviD and h.264 are ready to go - but audio codec support is limited: DTS, DD or AC3 audio failed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some competing smartphones don't support much else than MP4 videos with MP3/AAC audio, so this is good showing by the business phone. We do wish there was subtitle support though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 video player cannot edit video like it could on the Q10, but the Story Maker app is still here. It lets you pick multiple videos and photos and puts together a slideshow with a soundtrack of your choice. There are several different preset styles, which add an effect over the whole video (vintage, bleach pass, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go back and add/remove items, rearrange them and run them through the image or video editor if they need to be tweaked. By default, Story Maker saves the final videos in 720p resolution (the 1080p option has been removed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 might be a powerful video tool, but its square and small screen is not suitable for enjoying video watching. You can surely use the fit to screen options, but you'll lose 1/3 of a 16:9 video. Still, the BlackBerry Q5 wasn't made for entertainment, so we can't consider this a major drawback.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Snappy music player with no equalizers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The UI of the BlackBerry Q5 music player is pretty similar to the image gallery and video player. It has three tabs, the first of which displays recently added and recently played music. The second organizes the music library by Artist, Album or Genre and the third one displays all the playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface is pretty simple with big album art in the middle, surrounded by playback controls (including shuffle and repeat buttons). If you tap on the album art (or drag it down) you get the current playlist so you can easily jump between songs (swiping left and right between songs doesn't work). After a while, the playback controls fade and leave the whole screen to the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no playback controls on the lockscreen or the toggle dropdown a la Android, but the middle button of the hardware volume controls acts as play/pause.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, when changing the volume while there's a track playing, the little window with the volume level indicator does have playback controls and track info and album art. It's an odd place to put them and you have to hit a volume key each time you want to use them - we much prefer using the hardware keys for the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is DLNA-enabled, just like the gallery and video players. There's no equalizer though, it is the one major feature we missed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nicely smooth audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite its lower standing in the pecking order the BlackBerry Q5 easily matched and even slightly surpassed the audio output of its Q10 premium sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you use the smartphone with an active external amplifier you get excellent scores all over the place. The frequency response was spot-on and there was no detectable distortion. The signal to noise ratio and the dynamic range are great too and the only thing not perfect is the only average volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a moderate increase in stereo crosstalk when you plug in a pair of headphones, but the good news is none of the other readings are affected. Volume levels remain average, but the overall performance is perfectly solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera has potential, oversaturated colors ruin the results<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 comes with an 5MP main camera with an LED flash and a secondary 2MP camera. Both cameras can shoot HD video, 1080p for the main camera and 720p for the front-facing one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface looks pretty familiar at first - not too different than an Android camera - but much like the rest of the interface, the camera app has some handy tricks up its sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 offers three shooting models - Stills, Video and Time shift, the mode toggle is in the bottom right corner. Next to that is the Menu key, which offers several settings including a front/back camera switch, flash mode and aspect ratio (1:1, 4:3 or 16:9, there's no resolution setting).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here are the Scene mode toggle (Auto, Action, Whiteboard, Night, Beach or Snow) and the Shooting mode toggle. The still camera can just snap pics, do digital image stabilization or enable burst shot. Burst shot photos are snapped at full 5MP resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get some more settings for the camera if you swipe down - pick a default storage and toggle geo-tagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos are taken by just tapping the screen. You can use the volume rocker or the Space key as well, but we found no way to focus reliably If burst shot is enabled, then the camera will snap pics in quick succession while you have your finger on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had issues with the autofocus - many of the shots we took were out of focus. Most often the focus was just slightly off, but sometimes it was very wide of the mark and resulted in blurry images. The Q5 erroneously focused close by even though all the objects in the scene were far away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available but you have to drat the focus point, not just tap on the screen. Digital zoom is here too, it's activated through pinch zooming, but we would advise against using it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 camera UI has two handy shortcuts. A thumbnail of the last photo you've taken is in the lower left corner and you can tap it to go to the gallery. Better still, you can swipe it to enlarge that photo for a quick view of how it turned out, and it will be minimized again when you lift your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second shortcut appears in the upper left corner when flash mode is not set to auto. Tap the shortcut to get back to auto flash mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also has a feature called Time Shift - an increasingly popular and very cool trick that is making its way to a number of smartphones recently. It snaps several photos in quick succession with just one tap at the screen and automatically selects the best one. It also detects faces in the photo (which can take several seconds, depending on how many faces there are). Once that's done, Time Shift allows you to tweak the photo - pick a different photo from the 11 that were captured and for each individual face that was detected, you also get to choose from 11 snaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 is the first 5MP shooter of the new generation BlackBerries. Like the Q10, it oversaturates colors, but the Q5 has taken it to ridiculous amounts. As a result, all the images appear as if painted rather than shot and the noise level has increased unnecessarily. The saturation isn't balanced either, the color channels are boosted differently, which throws off the white balance (some photos had a heavy tint).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get over the saturation, the camera isn't really that bad for a 5MP shooter. There's decent amounts of fine detail for the most part, but post processing lets down the Q5 once again - noise reduction seems to be adaptive as some areas of the image exhibit heavy smudging (mostly shadows and high-detail areas), while other don't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you put the photos through an image processing app and tone down the saturation will result in okay looking shots, but the extra noise is forever sealed in the JPEG and we really don't want to do any post processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried the HDR mode, but it seemed to make the focus issue worse. The alignment between the two images with different exposure isn't perfect either and the results are pretty disastrous.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>5MP shooters are getting rare these days, but there are still plenty you can compare the BlackBerry Q5 against. The Q10 is also there with an 8MP camera. The third chart will give you a good idea of just how much the Q5 oversaturates colors.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video is the camera's saving grace<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Switching the camera to video mode doesn't affect the user interface, it just changes the options available from the Menu key. You can still enable digital image stabilization and pick from the preset scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During recording, you can move the focus point around (again by dragging, not tapping) and you can toggle the video light on and off. There's no way to capture photos during video recording though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main camera can shoot 1080p or 720p videos (720p is picked by default), while the front-facing camera can do only 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos are stored in MP4 files with 16Mbps total bitrate. Stereo sound is recorded at 192Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Q5 camera makes back some lost points. The clips produced are smooth at a consistent 30fps and while we've seen more detail out of 5MP / 1080p shooters and colors are once again oversaturated, there's no visible noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample video recorded with the BlackBerry Q5 that we uploaded to YouTube. You can also download this sample (0:07s, 13.8MB) that hasn't gone through YouTube compression.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 1080p video recording prowess of the BlackBerry Q5 makes it equal to its higher-end sibling, the Q10, in terms of video capture, not to mention every high-end phone out there. Our Video quality compare tool pits it against all of them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 covers the whole connectivity spectrum with five different versions. All of them have quad-band 2G GSM, quad-band 3G GSM (DC-HSPA+) and LTE support, but there are some key differences in the supported 3G and LTE bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 with Low Energy mode and a microUSB port for wired data connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board, allowing easy exchange of data. You can use the dedicated Smart Tags app to create tags (e.g. a tag with contact info), which you can send to another NFC-enabled phone. The app also handles reading tags and storing the data for when you're on the receiving end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 can create and read QR codes too, which is great for communicating with phones that don't have NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're here, we have to go over BlackBerry Link - the PC Suite for the Q5. The phone has the install file, just plug it in and install the app. Luckily, you don't need it for the USB data connection to work, you can simply enable mass storage mode from the settings and simply drag and drop files on your storage card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PC Link has its advantages though - once everything is installed, the phone storage will appear as a drive on your computer. You don't even need the USB cable, the phone will appear as a network drive once it's on the same Wi-Fi network as the computer (you can disable this if you like).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Link can schedule phone backups and automatically sync content (both docs and multimedia). That's great with the Wi-Fi option - it will seamlessly sync your docs at work and then your music at home, you don't need to do anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is great, but needing the app to install the right drivers is annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Link only supports dragging files from one place in the app to another (but you can use the computer's file browser option and save yourself the trouble).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we added the folder with the documents and dragged them over via Link, but while doing so we were amazed to see how long it took the app to scan a folder with only four docs inside. Scanning the phone's storage isn't blazing fast either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To top it all off, BlackBerry Link crashed a couple of times. iTunes and Zune are not the most faved apps around the office, and a buggy Link was the last thing we wanted to see from BlackBerry. Okay, we got this off our chest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in the end, mass storage is the best way to go about transferring files to your Q10 even if it only grants access to the microSD card and not the internal storage. With some polishing Link might prove to be a superior alternative - just not right now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser has clean UI, keeps Flash alive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 has a WebKit-based browser with full Flash support. The 3.1" screen isn't the best thing to browse on, but it does the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is pretty straightforward. The first thing you see is the New tab interface, which shows thumbnails of recently visited sites. It's a bit annoying that these can't be deleted. There's no Incognito/Private mode either, so be careful what sites you hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the main UI is pretty Windows Phone-like - the web page takes the whole screen, except for a line at the bottom (it even covers the status bar at the top of the screen). The line at the bottom holds a Tab switcher button, Back button, URL field and a Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tab switcher button brings up a list of currently open tabs, along with Bookmarks, History and a New tab shortcut. The current page you're browsing is pushed to the right to reveal all those. Instead of tapping the Tab switcher button, you can swipe to the right but the gesture needs to begin at the bottom where the Tab button is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can be a short swipe - just enough for the option icons to show up and get docked on the left side of the screen. That seems like a handy way to keep those options and tabs always at hand, but they hide as soon as you tap elsewhere - a missed opportunity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the browser is very fast and elaborate web sites are rendered without a hitch. Pinch zooming is smooth and there's double-tap to zoom too, but no text reflow. From the Menu button you get access to several more options, including Find on page and Share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool option has the browser remember which tabs were open, so the tabs will still be there even if you close the browser and open it again later (similar to desktop browsers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting option is Reader - it strips out the site's interface and leaves only the content, making it much easier to read on a phone's screen. It doesn't work very well with multi-page articles though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of these features are accessible with keyboard shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 has full Flash support - it's among the last active platforms that do. The dual-core Krait processor had no problem playing YouTube videos at 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry bragged about how good their browser is, so we ran a few benchmarks on it. Unfortunately, SunSpider 1.0 ran into an issue that didn't allow it to complete. The BrowserMark score is lower than what the Q10 managed, which was to be expected as the BlackBerry Q5 chipset is downclocked.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured office package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 comes with a full-blown Office document editor - you wouldn't expect any less, would you? It's called DocsToGo and can both view and create Word and Excel documents. It can edit PowerPoint presentations too, but cannot create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Word editor has all the text formatting features you'll need - everything from the standard bold, italic, underline through text justification, text and background color, font and text size, super and sub scripts, to list and paragraph styling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel editor works with multiple sheets, cell formatting and formulas, though we would have appreciated a formula auto-suggestion of some sort. We're no Excel gurus so typing out the formulas by hand out of memory was a real challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint presentations can be edited too, but only for small tweaks - you can't create new presentations from scratch or even add new slides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adobe Reader is on board for viewing PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 also came with an app called PrintToGo, which despite its name does not print documents. Quite the opposite in fact - it aims to replace printing on paper altogether. It does this by showing up as a printer on your computer. Then, all you need to send files to your phone is... print them to this virtual printer device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that's great for the Q5, but we think there is a lack of a cloud solution. Sure, you can sync your docs through Dropbox or Box, but Windows Phone has cloud integration with Microsoft's Office 365 and SkyDrive services and Android has Google Docs. These services handle both cloud storage of files and editing them online in the browser too, something we would have appreciated on the BlackBerry Q5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the time of writing, there are no official apps for Office, SkyDrive or Drive integration, though there are third party apps that do support them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer is a big part of every business phone and BlackBerry OS 10 has a worthy calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 calendar app uses a dedicated sidebar for navigation between the different view modes. To bring the sidebar up front you can use the virtual shortcut at the bottom left corner or just swipe to the right. There are six view modes - Agenda (a list of all events), People (events sorted by who's attending them), Day, Week and Month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each event has a reminder and can change your status for the duration of the event (Busy, Out of office, etc.). Viewing an event shows you three tabs - event details, invitees (invitations are sent over email) and emails related to that event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the calendar is good at scheduling things, it's not that great at keeping notes and other info you might need. This is where Remember steps in. You can add items to Remember from the app itself or just flag something in the BlackBerry Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each entry can be assigned to a folder (and folders can be color coded). Entries start off pretty simple - a subject and some additional notes, plus a message if the entry was added by flagging something in the Hub. From here you can add due date info, attach a photo, a voice note or any file. You can tag entries, but there's no easy way to sort entries by tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app features the same clock as the Bedside mode on the lockscreen. Notifications for incoming calls can be disabled in Bedside mode, for when you really need your sleep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch to a digital watch face if you prefer. You only get one alarm, you'll have to use calendar reminders if you need more. The alarm can have a repeat pattern and a customizable snooze time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app also has a World clock, stopwatch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 also has a Calculator app. It's slightly more advanced than most stock calculators with memory, square root and brackets visible by default. Results from your calculations go on a strip of "paper" that gets ripped off when you hit clear. Swiping the virtual numpad brings out the advanced functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also has unit converter and tip calculator modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather app pulls info from AccuWeather and shows the forecast for today and the next four days. You can add multiple cities and see an hourly forecast too. The app switches between a bright blue and black backgrounds depending on whether it's day or night in the selected city.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 comes with a full array of social networking apps out of the box, as the company has finally realized that social networking is important for both regular folk and businesses these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook app shows you your wall by default but you can easily check friend requests, messages and notifications. Posting a new status, image and checking in are equally easy. You can access more from the menu button in the top left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're wondering why the app doesn't use the standard BB OS 10 menus, it's because it just encapsulates Facebook's mobile site. Still, it works well enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the same with the Twitter app. It displays your timeline by default, but you can also use search, see what's trending and so on. Posting new tweets is easy and you can snap a new photo right within the app itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LinkedIn is a native app that allows you to post, look for connections, check your inbox and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Foursquare is a native app too. It lets you check what your friends are doing, search for cool new places and see how you're doing (your stats, badges and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry 10 comes with its own map application with map data sourced from TomTom and TeleCommunications Systems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app only features regular maps - no satellite images or street view. It can show traffic information, but there's no public transport or pedestrian navigation support. The database of places and venues isn't nearly as rich as that of Google Maps and the maps load pretty slowly too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, map coverage outside the US is spotty, but at least the search function has been improved. It looks for places near the location you're viewing (e.g. if you search "London" first then "Times Square", you get lots of Times Squares in the UK, but not the one in the US).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps application does have voice-guided navigation though. It requires an Internet connection. You can tweak the route planning algorithm by telling it to look for the Fastest, Simplest or Shortest routes and to avoid highways, toll roads, carpool lanes or ferries. Night mode can be enabled, disabled or set to activate automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add favorite places (Home and Work get special treatment) to find your way faster. If a contact from your address book has location info, you can quickly navigate there too. But you can't pick a point on the map and get a route to there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, our experience with BB OS 10's Map application is improving bit by bit, but it's still a long way from catching up to Google Maps, in terms of map data and speed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry World has all the apps, music and movies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry World app is your gateway to over 100,000 apps for your BlackBerry Q5. While not as many apps as Android and iOS have (or even Windows Phone), many of the major names are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>World is not too different from the Google Play Store. It shows featured apps on top of the screen, then two featured categories. Below that are Trending apps &amp; games, Top paid games and Top paid apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse just games or just apps, which also reveals the Top free items of that category. Speaking of categories, both apps and games are sorted into genre categories, if you're looking for a specific type of app/game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps and games usually come with at least a few screenshots and a description. You can also read user reviews, complete with a star rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned that BlackBerry World has a respectable number of apps for a new app store, but a good portion of those apps are Android ports (BlackBerry was handing $100 to devs who port their Android app to World).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, BlackBerry OS 10.1 didn't update the Android version and apps still run in Android 2.3. Android 4.1 is coming at some point, possibly with BB OS 10.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Running apps through an emulator is not an ideal solution, but it's the only way for a newly launched app store to quickly get a respectable number of titles. If the BB10 lineup does well, we are sure many developers will release native versions of their apps sooner rather than later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like Google's Play Store, the BlackBerry World offers more than just apps - you can buy music, movies and TV shows from here. You can just rent them too. No HDMI port means the only way to play movies and TV shows from the Q5 is DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Q5 also offers a Games center, where you can track, share and compare your games progress with your friends.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With BlackBerry charging a ridiculous amount of money on the Q10 - it's hard to find under $600 / ?490 SIM-free. Seriously, the first BB10 QWERTY handset costs more than a Z10, and any competing flagship, so one would think it's an opportunity the Q5 just can't miss. The BlackBerry Q5 is almost the same phone, but with saner pricing of under $400 / ?340 (still pretty steep, a Z10 is $440 / ?380).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Q5 has the same screen size and resolution, though it's an LCD instead of AMOLED (give the quality, we have no complaints here). It uses the same Snapdragon chipset with dual-core Krait, but it's downclocked. At least the Q5 has the full 2GB of RAM. There's fast HSPA+ and LTE too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we get to the QWERTY keyboard, the Q5's raison d'etre, and we found it lacking. It wasn't as good as the Q10's keyboard, actually we'd rather have the Z10's on-screen keyboard - when you get used to it, it's really fast and comfortable to type on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has potential but until BlackBerry fixes the autofocus and the post-processing (or at least gives us the option to tone down the extra-strong saturation), we'd call it below average, even for a 5MP shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we're not thrilled by the looks either - the BlackBerry Q5 is not an awful-looking package but we've seen more attractive Curves for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q10 may be overpriced, but it fixes a lot of the issues of the Q5. Most importantly the hardware QWERTY is just better and if you're looking for a QWERTY-packing device that's what you'll want to hear. Not that you'll mind premium looks, an AMOLED screen, faster chipset, a better 8MP camera and microHDMI port. Here's hoping BlackBerry reconsider the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Q10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z10, supposedly the flagship in the lineup, is not that much more expensive than the Q5. And it has a bigger and better screen, faster chipset, better camera and an on-screen keyboard, which really is that good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Z10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're going to give up the QWERTY keyboard (let's face it, it's a relic of the past), you might as well go with Microsoft. The Redmond-based company is using its piles of cash and Windows + Office install base to push Windows Phone forward. And with an integrated Office suite and cloud services it has a compelling solution. Windows Phone has yet to capture a significant part of market, but then again so does BlackBerry 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ S has a large 4.8" 720p Super AMOLED screen with good chipset and camera and it's a steal - it costs around $320 / ?210 (we even found it as low as $280).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 has optical image stabilization and will soon get the same camera app as the Lumia 1020, not to mention the free offline navigation with worldwide coverage (it's good too, nothing like BlackBerry Maps). It goes for $400 / ?280.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 8X is a bit low on memory (16GB non-expandable) but for $320 / ?220 it brings HTC design and Beats Audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Ativ S I8750 ? Nokia Lumia 920 ? HTC Windows Phone 8X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>QWERTY on Android is all but gone. If you're in the US, however, there are still a few options - the Samsung Galaxy Stratosphere II I415 for Verizon, Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G T699 for T-Mobile, Motorola Photon Q 4G LTE and LG Mach LS860 for Sprint (what's with US carriers and stupid names?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically they have 4" WVGA screens (the Motorola has 4.3" qHD), landscape slide-out QWERTY, dual-core Krait processor, they run at least Android 4.0 ICS and have LTE connectivity (except for the T-Mo phone, which only has 42Mbps HSPA+).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are last year's phones, so they can usually be found pretty cheap SIM-free and free on contract. And keep in mind your beloved BBM is coming to Android soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung Galaxy Stratosphere II I415 ? Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G T699 ? Motorola Photon Q 4G LTE XT897 ? LG Mach LS860</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 looks like the classic work phone - it's not fancy, not even pretty, but it gets the job done, plain and simple. Considering where the market is heading though, a Z5 would've made more sense. You know, an affordable full-touch phone to probably try and compete with Android and Windows Phone in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>People would often spend a small fortune to make a statement and be different - the Q10 is the phone for them. The Q5 obviously struggles to match Android and Microsoft prices even without the premium vibe of its bigger sibling. With QWERTY messengers reduced to an even smaller niche, it would've made sense for BlackBerry to make it an exclusive, premium niche. Once bitter rival Nokia had to make an even tougher decision, when it killed the other major player in the QWERTY field - Symbian.</paragraph>
