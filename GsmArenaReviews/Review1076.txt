			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Back up against the wall, Nokia looks to the launch of the first Windows Phone 8 smartphones as a make or break moment. It?s not essential for the Lumia 820 and Lumia 920 to become bestsellers, but it?s absolutely vital that they convince users of Microsoft?s mobile platform's potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android and iOS made short work of Windows Phone 7 and had it relegated to an also-ran. Now, one thing Nokia simply cannot afford is let history repeat itself. However, the Nokia Lumia 820 is, in a way, the luckier of the two global Nokia flagships. It will compete in a lower price bracket than the Lumia 920, safely out of the way of iconic devices like the Galaxy S III, the One X and the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, the Nokia Lumia 820 is not without its advantages - even over the almighty flagship 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its premium sibling, the Nokia Lumia 820 kindly offers a microSD card slot for cheap memory expansion, a user-replaceable battery and exchangeable covers. What?s more, it even has a counter-argument against the advanced PureMotion HD+ display of the Lumia 920 - and it's good-ol' AMOLED. We won?t get tired of saying that Windows Phone?s Modern UI feel most at home on screens of infinite contrast such as the one on the Lumia 820.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The spec sheet isn't likely to make geeks do backflips, but the level of flexibility, combined with the more attractive price tag, might earn the Nokia Lumia 820 the popular vote. And as we said ? it?s all about gaining traction for the Windows Phone 8 army now. Cashing in can wait for a few more months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll have a better idea of where the Lumia 820 stands by the time we are done with the review. Join us after the break for our traditional unboxing and hardware checkup.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package covers the basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 820 ships in a very similar box to what the first gen of Finnish Windows Phone smartphones used to have. Sadly, there isn't much to get excited about inside - a USB cable, an A/C adapter and a pair of earphones is all you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 820 has a memory card slot but there's no microSD card in the bundle. There?re no spare covers either ? you?ll have to get those yourself. Most high-end smartphones don?t offer anything more than that anyway, so it will be unfair to the Lumia 820 to deduct points here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 820 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 820 is one extra solid piece of gear - not too tall but strong and physical. The heavily built smartphone measures 123.8 x 68.5 x 9.9 mm, which is by no means the compact alternative of the flagship Lumia 920. The cheaper, less sophisticated option perhaps, but not compact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest, the Lumia 820 is rather generously sized for a 4.3-incher. The Motorola RAZR M, for example, is 1.6mm slimmer and almost 8mm narrower, while still packing a larger battery. Of course, the Nokia Lumia 820 has a user-removable back panel and a slightly larger screen (due to the different aspect) to show for it, but that?s hardly enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 160g weight is another thing that might be held against the Lumia 820 - that?s 27g more than a Galaxy S III, which boasts a much bigger screen. And while the extra heft certainly contributes to a solid, reliable feel, it?s something you should definitely consider. The Lumia 820 isn't a device you'd simply slip in a pocket and forget it's there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If there?s one area where Nokia is still going strong, despite all recent trouble, it?s the design of their smartphones. The Lumia 820 has its body entirely made of plastic, but that doesn?t take anything away from its clean, smooth looks. It?s not as exciting as the Lumia 920, but it?s certainly one that you wouldn?t mind being seen with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In some strange way it resembles an HTC phone - in every good way possible. Hard to put a finger on, but there're certain similarities to an HD 2, or a Desire HD. A bit ironic actually, considering the allegations that HTC have borrowed the design of their Windows Phone 8 smartphones from Nokia's Lumia range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choice of materials is excellent and the build quality is impeccable. The metal accent around the camera lens at the back is the only thing that doesn?t quite work perfectly. Overall, the Nokia Lumia 820 looks way better than most mid-range smartphones out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, given that practicality is also a function of the design, we might even be tempted to give the nod to this approach over the Lumia 920?s unibody, which doesn?t play nice with microSD card slots and removable batteries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've always said that AMOLED and the Windows Phone OS are a match made in heaven. The 4.3" screen of the Lumia 820 is taken straight from the former flagship, Lumia 900, and is quick to impress with excellent contrast and sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no PenTile matrix to worry about here, but the sharpness of the screen is obviously not as good as on those 720p displays. The Lumia 820 makes up for that with ultra wide viewing angles and, overall, there aren?t too many better displays at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the Nokia Lumia 820 results from our display tests. You can find more about what we test and how over here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the screen you will find a discreet earpiece, the ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are the three touch-sensitive buttons for getting around the Windows Phone 8 UI. The microphone pinhole is also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is absolutely nothing on the phone's left side but things get a lot busier on the right. The volume rocker is there, along with the power/lock key and a dedicated camera button. The latter would launch the camera even if the phone is locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is the only thing of interest on the Nokia Lumia 820's top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the bottom of the phone, we find the microUSB port and the single speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device is where the 8MP camera lens and dual LED flash can be found. The Carl Zeiss certified lens is set within a chrome plate that's a rather subtle accent on our black test unit's battery cover. We're not so sure about the contrast that will make it pop on a bright red or yellow exchangeable cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To open the Nokia Lumia 820 battery cover you have to force a finger nail in the thin gap and carefully undo the stops and pull the cover from around the phone's inner body. It?s a bit harder compared to most other solutions, but the upside is there're almost no visible gaps, which benefits the overall looks of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s good news and bad news under the hood. The bad news is that despite the ample available space Nokia only managed to fit a 1650 mAh battery in here. That?s still rated to last for up to 330 hours of stand-by or 8 hours of talk time on 3G networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our dedicated battery test, the Lumia 820 achieved an overall endurance score of 40h. This means that you?ll have to charge the smartphone every 40 hours if you use it for an hour of talking, an hour of web browsing and an hour of video playback per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Nokia Lumia 820 battery test scorecard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news here is the microSD card slot, which lets you increase the 8GB of in built storage on the Lumia 820 up to five-fold. microSD cards are going for pennies these days, so you won?t need to pay the premium manufacturers charge for smartphones with more internal storage out of the box either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 820 is comfortable to use and single-handed operation is relatively easy. As we said, it could have been narrower (and lighter for that matter), but having all the controls on one side certainly helps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone?s curved sides allow it to fit perfectly in your hand. The matte finish works well to improve grip and the handset looks like it will last for quite a while.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Improved user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 is meant to look the same across all devices but makers still have a way to customize the experience and stand out against the competition. Nokia has more leeway than other makers thanks to its deal with Microsoft, but it also has the most riding on the platform - Nokia doesn't have Android to fall back on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, WP8 on a Nokia Lumia is noticeably different from what you get from competing makers thanks to a number of exclusive features. We'll cover them one by one, but first here's a look at the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the primary interface looks mostly the same, there are a number of improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. Pushing the volume rocker in either direction will bring the sound switch and music controls on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device or you can just press and hold the camera shutter key to unlock the phone and jump straight to the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft added a lot of flexibility and functionality to the lockscreen - the Live Apps service allows apps to add notifications and images on the lockscreen. You can set one app to display big notifications ("detailed status") and up to five more apps get to show more limited info ("quick status").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen wallpaper can also be controlled by apps - one of the installed apps can be set to choose the image (e.g. Bing's beautiful background images or photos from your Facebook account) or you can let the music player change the lockscreen image to the album art of the currently playing track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Modern UI is a vertical grid of Live tiles, which can be reordered the way you like. Almost anything can be pinned to the homescreen - apps, contacts, web pages and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 introduces resizable live tiles - when you tap and hold on a tile, you'll get additional resize button to the unpin one. You can opt between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu). In our mind, the process of resizing live tiles could've been better. In order to switch from big to normal and then small you have to hit the same toggle - it would've made more sense if there were separate ones to make a tile bigger and smaller or resize tiles by dragging like in Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts, but that's oversimplifying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 can do multitasking - well, not true multitasking, but an iOS-like approach instead. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them (e.g. continue playing music). But just like iOS, if an app needs to run in the background (navigation clients, messengers, etc.) it can. The WP offers both kind of multi-tasking and it's up to developers to choose how their apps operate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-tasking interface is the same as in WP7 - to switch between apps you press and hold the Back key. You'll get thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to your running or suspended app. You can't "kill" any of those apps from here - to exit one you must bring it to front and use the Back key to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you start frantically hitting the back key it will start closing all of the open apps, which is very unnatural, especially when you've got an open Internet Explorer, which has to go all the way back to the first loaded page before it closes. Overall, it's best to let the OS manage the apps and not worry about which ones are opened or closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would've liked to see some kind of quick toggles in Windows Phone 8 to spare you the need to go all the way to the settings menu to enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature we feel is missing is a place where you can see all of your notifications from various apps. Live tiles manage to show notifications from each app to some extent, but they don't really have enough room for things like e-mail subject and such, while Android and iOS notification areas do. Microsoft has expressed that it's working on just such a feature and that we should see it in a future update to WP 8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 also can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate or have the phone read text out, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too - Android's got Google Voice Actions, Apple has Siri and there are a number of third party "virtual voice assistants" available. The Windows assistant though is still far behind the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features brought by WP8 is the Kids corner. You can select the apps and the types of media content that goes in and password-protect it, so you can safely share your smartphone with your kids without worrying that they will mess up your settings or access inappropriate content. When activated, the Kids corner is accessible by swiping left of the lockscreen. If you've secured it, your kids won't be able to return to your standard lock and home screen without the password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, however you protect your phone, you can do nothing against accidental (or not) meetings with the floor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft is trying to appeal to business users too - a company can create its own Hub where employees can find news, calendars and other info to help them with their work. Companies can also create their own apps that only employees can install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found that AnTuTu has a Windows Phone 8 version, so we ran it to see how the Lumia 820 stacks up against other platforms. Here are the results:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It looks pretty good, though we're not sure just how much we can trust cross-platform results. Two Krait cores (Lumia 820) coming ahead of four (LG Optimus G) in particular can point to some software issue with the benchmark.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub for contacts and social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the best phone/social book up to date. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email contacts - everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored letter tiles. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate). You can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to make the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is similar but more advanced - it's a private social network of sorts. Rooms allows group chats, but also sharing a private calendar, notes (including to-do lists), photos and videos. The default Room is the Family room and you can easily invite your relatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is that they don't all need WP8 phones to get in - Windows Phone 7 handsets and iPhones can join a room too, though they only get the shared calendar. Android users are left out. Still, Rooms is a great way to keep in touch and get organized, while avoiding the clutter of Facebook and the likes where everyone has too many friends and too many notifications waiting for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations. You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions - "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab displays the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, listed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 820 offered loud and clear in-call sound and we had no issues with signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any calls from being accidentally answered or rejected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 820 scored an average. The loudspeaker isn't the loudest around but missed calls shouldn't be a problem. You can read more about how we do tests here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are only displayed when the conversation moves across platforms to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which service to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you of what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as expected, letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The email client<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conversation view lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages and a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them as read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photos integrates with SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5. You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. Apps can integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't sort individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends and contacts so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll presents your entire collection of photos and videos captured with the device in a 4x5 grid. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or a pinch. We like it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook and the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo automatically. It's a nice feature but one that produces less than stellar results at times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Mix Radio and Music + Videos tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is pushing their own music service called Mix Radioahead on the default Music + Video app. It offers free music streaming (it works out of the box) and has an extensive library of tracks. While it is mostly streaming oriented, you can make tracks available offline in Mix Radio (they remain on the device only temporarily though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Mix Radio competes with services like Pandora too - you can give it a list of artists you like and it will automatically build a playlist to your taste. Nokia takes pride in real people creating the mixes (including celebrity-made mixes) instead of computer algorithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike competing services you can also browse a specific artist and even buy songs to keep if you like. There are plenty of charts (e.g. Top sellers, Best of 2012, Songs for Fall) if you're looking for something new too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's app has several other advantages - it has several equalizer presets (including a custom one) and it has Dolby Headphones enhancements. Also, if you like an artist, the app will help you look for gigs close to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Windows Phone 8 media players are on-board too. They reside together in the Music + Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to or watch podcasts, or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when syncing with Zune. The third section is where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music hub has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Since the GDR2 update, the Lumia 820 now has FM Radio support, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a timeline and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since our last encounter. Now it supports XviD (though we had some issues with this codec), DivX and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is no subtitle support at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is no longer Zune dependent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual items can be pinned to the homescreen - like a song or video</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality has its ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 820 turned out to be the best of the three WP8 smartphones we have tested in the first part of our audio quality test. When connected to an active external amplifier, the Lumia 820 got great scores all over the field and had average volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, there's quite a lot of degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. The intermodulation distortion increases significantly and the stereo crosstalk spikes, too. In this scenario the Nokia Lumia 820 is actually some way off its WP8 competitors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera with many features, OK image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 820 boasts an 8MP camera with interesting sensor design - it snaps photos at 3264 x 2448 resolution in 4:3 mode and 3552 x 2000 in 16:9 mode, only 11% less resolution. Most other cameras simply crop a 4:3 photo into a 16:9 photo and lose a quarter of the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a 26mm wide-angle lens with f/2.2 aperture and a dual-LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, front/back camera toggle, flash mode setting and the Lens button. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness and ISO among others. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key will wake the phone up with a single press and launch the camera app. The Lumia 820 is not the fastest shooter around and it takes it a couple of seconds before a photo is taken. This is more delay than we're used to from modern phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenses is an interesting feature, enhancing the camera functionality without making a mess of third party apps each with its own UI. Lenses are accessible directly from the native camera app (they show up in the list of installed apps too if you want to pin a Lens to the start screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has preloaded the Smart Shoot lens, which is by far the most powerful, and you can also download the Panorama and Cinemagraph lenses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Shoot uses Scalado technology (Nokia owns the company) - it shoots multiple photos and lets you pick which one to save (a sort of burst mode). You can also pick the best face and cycle through each facial expression a person made while the camera was snapping photos. The third option is Erase, which will remove moving objects (e.g. someone walking in front of the landmark you're trying to shoot just as you press the shutter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama does what it says - you press the shutter and then align the camera as instructed (the app will put circles you have to aim for). It's good, but you always shoot right to left (can't switch direction), which is a bit annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cinemagraph create photos that are mostly static, but a part of them is animated, it really brings them to life. You have to hold the phone steady while shooting. When you're done, the Lens will offer two (sometimes three) areas that can be animated and when you pick an area, you can tweak the animation, trim it, and set the loop pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 820 doesn't do too well when it comes to actual image quality. Photos are grainy and noise reduction smears away fine detail. Photos have a yellowish tint, other than that colors are reasonably accurate. Overall, photo quality is average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of Cinemagraphs and a panorama we shot with the Lumia 820 too.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera is better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the still camera's and has plenty of features too. You can change the white balance, sharpness and the video resolution among other things. The LED flash can be made to work as a video light, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 820 shoots 1080p and 720p videos (720p is the default mode). The quality of the videos is good in terms of fine detail. Colors have a slight yellow tint again but the bigger problem is that the continuous autofocus is a bit too sensitive (at least it's quick and mostly unobtrusive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bitrate of the 1080p video was a steady 21 Mbps while the framerate hovered around the 30 fps mark. Audio is recorded in mono (99Kbps, 44.1kHz), which is rather disappointing, given that the smartphone has two microphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With 720p videos the bitrate fell to around 16 Mbps with the same 30 fps framerate. Audio is mono again too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here's a 1080p sample we uploaded to YouTube:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity - everything's covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 820 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, quad-band 3G with HSPA and penta-band 4G LTE connectivity. If you're in range of an LTE network, the 820 will do up to 100Mbps downlink and 50Mbps uplink. If not, HSDPA still offers reasonably good speeds at 42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 2.1. Bluetooth is no longer limited as to what it can do - there's file transfer support now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Mass Storage mode for the internal phone storage and you can upload files without needing to install any software. There is no requirement as to where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to handle a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it to emails, because there is no file manager and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your phone storage, you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 820 also has NFC connectivity, which is used in the Wallet app. Unfortunately, we won't know whether that has any potential to expand beyond its out-of-the-box functionality for at least a few more months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is still useful for file sharing and it works across other platforms with NFC support. Sending a picture with a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, for instance, wasn't a problem and the same goes for web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC comes into play with some accessories too - like the JBL PowerUp speaker that automatically starts playing when you put the Lumia 820 on top of it and will charge it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer is smart, fast and sociable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone 8 brings got a major upgrade, but kept its old looks. Almost everything Microsoft has done on the IE is under the hood and the end result is close to excellent. The Lumia 820 has a big enough screen for comfortable browsing, but the pixel density is average, so text can get fuzzy at low zoom levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar - by default, anything you type that doesn't resolve to an URL will be sent over to the Bing app. You can also pick Google as a search provider, which will open the Google search results page in the browser instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it prompts choosing a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share option is interesting in that you can not only send the page address in a message, but you can share it with your Xbox (if you have it set up). This way you can easily transfer a page from your phone to your TV and continue browsing there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can open more than six tabs simultaneously, eight or ten worked just fine (WP7.x used to have a restriction on the number of tabs).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expected the Nokia Lumia 820 to match the other WP8 phones we've tested in terms of performance in the SunSpider and BrowserMark benchmark tests and it delivered.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Windows Phone 8 has built-in mobile data management tools called Data Sense. Its purpose is twofold - it tracks how much data each app has used and can even help you save data by compressing web pages and images before they are sent to the browser (similar to Opera's Turbo). Data Sense depends on carrier support and doesn't work yet (not even tracking data usage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia is working on the Xpress Browser for Windows Phone, which does the web page compression trick independently of carriers, but that isn't available for the Lumia 820 yet. We're slightly disappointed that Microsoft and Nokia promised stuff that we wanted to try out, only to find out it's not yet available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looking glass button on the Lumia 820 brings you to the new Bing search app. At first glance, it's the same app overall - you type in a query and you get search results from the web and there's a pretty background photo with several translucent squares you can tap to learn interesting facts about the subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing offers more than just web results though - for example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three search features you can quickly reach from the default Bing screen. The first one is Local Scout, which lets you search for various points of interest around you. There's the camera scanner too, which can snap a photo of text, run OCR and translate it into another language - this is the so-called Bing Vision camera lens. The third one is the song recognition feature that gives you track and artist name and takes you to the music store so you can buy the track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also tries to be a bit of a homepage too - you can swipe to the left to browse top videos, locally playing movies and top headlines.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Store for apps, games and music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Store (formerly Phone Marketplace) is still playing catch up with the Apple App Store and the Android Market. The number of apps available is higher than 100,000 and, while that doesn't quite compare to Android and iOS, Microsoft says that 46 out of the top 50 apps are already available for WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps written specifically for Windows Phone 8 won't work on the older versions but all of the older apps will be compatible with the new WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is divided in three main sections - applications, games and music. A fourth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, a few screenshots and permissions. While the list of permissions isn't as prominent as it is on Android, the Store will explicitly ask you about the important stuff (e.g. location info).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (you can list all or free apps only), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia App Recommendations will help you get the best apps right off the bat, including a number of Nokia Lumia-exclusives (things like Nokia Weather Channel, which you might have missed) and categories like Starter pack or Shop til you drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox (previously known as Zune) Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected), just like you would on a Zune player (it's 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the trial option, which is available to many games and apps. You can try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Store but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Store) or the avatar changing app. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps and Drive, other location-based apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia is bringing their own mapping solutions to the table and they are more powerful than the default Bing Maps that other Windows Phones come with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Drive is the premium app - it offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation anywhere in the world. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Drive you can easily plan routes (all offline, unlike the early iterations of this app) and you can tweak various settings for each route - fastest/shortest/economical route can be selected and you can choose whether the app will use or avoid motorways, toll roads, ferries, tunnels, unpaved roads and motor trains. There are icons to remind you of the selected settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive uses big, clear instructions on its screen in addition to the voice prompts, which is ideal for in-car use. You can switch between 2D and 3D mode and switch the color scheme (day, night, auto). There are speed alerts and real-time traffic information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do miss a few options - like setting a starting location other than your current location and downloading maps for an entire continent. Still, Nokia offer quality maps and offline voice-guided navigation out of the box, which puts them ahead of other Windows Phone makers an even other platforms (both Android and iOS require a data connection to plan the route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app also offers walking, driving and public transport navigation but it only shows a list of instructions. It shares data with Drive so you don't have to download the same maps twice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Local Scout app will locate nearby points of interest and it will even show you indoor maps of malls. The app has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from an "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have an exclusive app to help you find things near you too - it's called City Lens and it's an augmented reality app. Basically, it launches the camera and overlays various icons representing the nearby POI (along with distance and star rating), moving as you pan the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch to a traditional list too - you just hold the phone upright and it will switch automatically (it's triggered by the accelerometer). Or if you hold the phone perpendicular to the ground, it will switch to map view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a place will fire up Nokia Maps so you can have a look at the extensive info it offers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great Office experience on mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub has the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness of simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code to make them easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right. Each alarm can have its own name, sound and repeat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's easy to appreciate the Nokia Lumia 820 for its build quality and level of equipment, but when you realize it's just the sensible, mid-range package by the Finns, you may even begin to be impressed. As the Windows Phone platform is growing out of its infancy, the more affordable member of the new Lumia duo has a far wider audience to appeal to and it might just be able to grab that chance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 820 is built to a high standard and its AMOLED screen is well above average. It's a silky smooth performer too and one that has access to the third richest app repository in the business. There's also the free lifetime voice-guided navigation, which adds an extra dimension to the whole package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we see it, this still won't be enough to beat the droid army in terms of productivity, especially considering that the Lumia 820 is priced right about the level of droid flagships such as the HTC One X and the Galaxy S III. However, you'd have to be completely new to the smartphone business to expect WP to magically leapfrog the major platforms overnight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Microsoft needs to do now is present itself as a worthy alternative of Android and iOS, offering a safe exit to anyone willing to experience something new without sacrificing any of the core functionality. From that perspective, the Lumia 820 comes in as a great option. It looks cool but its appeal goes beyond appearance. This smartphone knows a few cool tricks to keep you interested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you still aren't sold and would rather shop around some more, here's what else your money can get you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the Lumia 820 currently costs as much as a Galaxy S III or an HTC One X, both of which offer 720p screens and Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. It's an uneven battle here, but we guess the Lumia 820 won't be in it for long. Its price should settle to a more reasonable level as soon as the availability widens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III ? HTC One X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, the Lumia 820 will end up in the less intimidating company of the Samsung Galaxy Premier, the Sony Xperia S, the HTC One S and the Motorola RAZR M. Those three offer a choice of better screens and superior finish, on top of being more versatile and having better app stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Lumia 820 has a few tricks up its sleeve too - both in terms of features (free Sat Nav, Office package) and aesthetics (the Modern UI is brilliantly simple).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung Galaxy Premier I9260 ? Sony Xperia S ? HTC One S ? Motorola RAZR M XT905</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 might turn out to be the real game changer here. It boasts far superior hardware than the Lumia 820 and after-sale support to match that of the Finns. It also costs as low already as the Lumia 820 is ever likely to drop. However, LG and Google will really have to address the supply shortages if they are to really make an impact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Nexus 4 E960</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Lumia 820 faces some competition within its very own WP camp. However, no two current WP8 smartphones have the same level of equipment. It's arguable whether it's a conscious move to make sure they don't cancel each other out, or a coincidence, but the Nokia Lumia 820 doesn't seem to have a direct rival. It slots in instead between HTC's Windows Phone 8X and Windows Phone 8S. These two are you best options if you are looking to move slightly up or down the WP ladder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Windows Phone 8X ? HTC Windows Phone 8S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 820 is a solid smartphone - a massive update over any of the first generation of Finnish WP devices, it has a better shot at competing with its Android rivals. The Google-powered competition still has a comfortable lead and even the huge leap Microsoft's platform has taken, combined with Nokia's design expertise, isn't enough to overturn the status-quo overnight. On the other hand, things are closer now than they have ever been. The Lumia 820 brings Windows Phone another step closer to the moment when it will no longer be just a fresh looking alternative, but the prime choice for power users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And Apple shouldn't lower its guard either - the Nokia Lumia 820 is a midrange smartphone that was never supposed to threaten the iPhone, but its bigger brother, the Lumia 920 might have a thing or two to say about it.</paragraph>
