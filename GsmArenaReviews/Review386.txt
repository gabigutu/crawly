			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W850 is the next Walkman phone, but this time it comes in the slider form factor. It boasts a large display with QVGA resolution, full 3G capabilities with video calls, a 2 megapixel camera and the latest Walkman 2.0 music player. It's an expensive mobile to start with but hopes are that it's got more than needed to become a bestseller. Our job is to look through it thoroughly and present you some good information about it. In the end, the buying decision is all yours.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first time we saw W850 it was in the popular "Da Vinci code" movie even before the handset itself was announced. The strangest thing was that it was not used as a Walkman music player but purely for it web browser capabilities. We suppose it should say something about the versatility of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to functionality, the Sony Ericsson is almost identical to K800 and as long as the manufacturer is concerned, both would be positioned in the same price class. So good things don't come cheap, as you would see. And W850 is really a nice handset features and performance-wise - it boasts all the treats for the music-loving Walkman die-hard fan. In fact, it comes in two versions, just as K800 does. The only difference between the twins W850 and W830 are the available connectivity options. While W850 comes with GPRS/UMTS networks support along with video calls, just as K800, the Sony Ericsson W830 comes packed with GPRS/EDGE networks support only, just as K790 does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slight difference though is that W850 is now available, while we are still waiting for W830 to hit the market. Anyway, bear in mind that we are talking about identical mobiles and this review holds true for both of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let's get back to our review. The Sony Ericsson W850 is available in two color flavors - one in matt black and one in pearl white. The one we got to test was the dark variant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As regards the retail package, the box should include the Sony Ericsson stereo headset HPM-70, a USB cable and a 1GB Memory Stick Duo Pro card but as we have always said - the contents of the retail package are market and country dependant.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stylish music box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W850 design does not follow the latest trends in slimness, nor does it impress as a lightweight device. It weighs 116 g and when closed, it is as large as K800, being only a tad shorter. In fact its measures of 98 x 47 x 21 mm make it just about the size of Sony Ericsson W800. Despite its weight when held in hand the mobile does not seem heavy at all and is perfectly balanced. The body is made out of matt plastic, which feels very nice to touch. What is more, the display is the only place where you can find traces of fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of construction, we are not very pleased with the slider, because it gave out creaking sounds every time we touched it. Otherwise, the sliding mechanism is firm and steady allowing for the phone to be opened and closed single-handedly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When closed, the greater part of the front panel is taken by the large 2" TFT display. It looks a lot like the one used in K800, and even the speaker grill above the display looks absolutely the same. Never mind, we have always found the design of K800 really stylish, so there is no wrong in copying some elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's worth mentioning that the two elements on both sides of the ear speaker grill are in fact keys, just as in K800/K790. These are called Photo keys and serve as context keys for various functions such as view camera album pictures in fullscreen, view camera album pictures in thumbnail mode or turn on/off the camera LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson W850 when closed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the handset reveals the alphanumeric keypad, which is made out of the same material the body is made of. The styling is great and it is rather comfortable to work with, but more on navigation and keypad is to come later on in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson W850 when opened ? Zooming in on the keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the slider is pretty bare and in fact, it doesn't accommodate any keys at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Left side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Such is the case with the bottom part of the device, which incorporates only an eyelet for neck strip on the right, the Infrared port on the left, and the usual Fast Port in the middle, which is used for charging and for attaching any peripherals such as the earpieces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Bottom part</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the right side of the mobile boasts the camera shutter key and the two volume keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Right side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough though, the usually dull upper part of the handset accommodates the memory card slot beside the on/off key and the light sensor. The memory card format used is the Memory Stick PRO Duo, which is really nice since it would offer full compatibility with Memory stick card that you perhaps already own. Of course, that would hardly be necessary, since W850 is supplied with a 1GB card in the retail package. And if that's just not enough you can always buy a larger capacity card since those are already available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Top part</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the phone has a rather interesting surface texture. It provides for a nice firm grip and doesn't catch any visible fingerprints. What is more, it looks very nice and attractive. The main design elements on the back are the Walkman logo, which in fact hides the loudspeaker grill, the 2 megapixel camera lens, the camera flashlight LED and the self-portrait mirror.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  W850 back panel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the upper part of the phone up reveals another interesting design solution. The back part of the upper panel, which is revealed when the slider is opened, is covered with a metal plate that bears the Walkman logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sliding the phone out</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover is straightforward as always and poses no trouble, while the cover itself is tightly closed. Beneath it lays a standard Li-Polymer Sony Ericsson BST-33 battery with a capacity of 950 mAh. The SIM card bed is right under it and is a standard Sony Ericsson one, meaning that the SIM is easy to put in but a nightmare to pull out with bare hands. According to the manufacturer, the battery should last up to 350 hours of standby mode and up to 7 hours of talk time when used in GSM-only network. The most exciting promise of the manufacturer though is that the battery would allow W850 to play music continuously for the amazing 30 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did spend a few days using the phone in the way a regular user would, spending about 10-15 minutes of talking a day and using almost no other feature and the fully charged battery kept the W850 running only for 3 twenty-four-hour periods in GSM-only network.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A flashy keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad features some really nice features that are worth mentioning along with some really bad solutions. If you've ever wondered what exactly the orange plastic thing just below the display is for, the answer is that in fact it is a shortcut key for starting the Walkman music player. Just above it, right at the display base, there is a metallic edge, on which you can rest your thumb when trying to open or close the slider. Undoubtedly, when doing this you are almost prone to start the music player accidentally. But you can get used to this in the course of time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On both sides of the Walkman key there are a couple of round context keys, which are rather comfortable to work with. Below the Walkman key, you can see the unusual navigation pad and four other keys - the Back key, the Web browser key, the correction C key and finally, the Activity menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now when it comes to user-friendliness, the navigation solution used in W850 is some of the most uncomfortable ones ever seen in a Sony Ericsson mobile and none of the members of our team thinks they might ever get used to it. It's really hard to press without applying a serious amount of pressure. Furthermore, if you have large fingers, you are almost sure to press the Walkman key every second time you try pressing the upwards direction on the navigation keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson W850 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough with all that grudging, let's turn our attention to something really interesting, and that is the Light Effects mode of the keypad. Basically, what it means is that when you turn it on, the backlighting of the whole upper part starts pulsing along the beat of the currently played music file. And it's not just pulsing in its own far-fetched beat, but instead it pulses to the real beat of the music, making for a great visual effect. Speaking of backlighting, it is worth mentioning that the whole keypad glows in even white until you turn on the Walkman music player. This is the moment when the upper part of the keypad starts glowing in orange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, W850 can not measure up to the capabilities of let say Motorola V80 for example which has numerous colorful LEDs combinations and its lights pulse to the beat not only of the currently playing track, but also to the beat of the currently playing music in the room - the so-called Party Lights function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric part of the keypad is a joy to use and it would get you typing with lightning speed in no time when you start using the mobile. The keys are nicely offset and they have a strong, positive feedback when pressed. All that means that you would rarely make any typos in your messages.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The real eye-catcher<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the real eye catcher, that most positively must be the large 2" TFT display capable of displaying 262K colors in a QVGA resolution. The colors are vivid and pleasant. The contrast is nice, too. Thanks to the available light sensor, the display brightness varies according to the available ambient light and respectively gets boosted in bright daylight and gets dimmed in the dark. The only flaw that we might find with the display is that it is a magnet for fingerprints. When it comes to using it under direct sunlight, it scores just the same as K800 - pretty legible, but we've seen better. In fact, currently, maybe Nokia makes the most successful legibility-under-sun-proof displays. But that's just our opinion. There is no way to test that objectively. Speaking of legibility, we've seen a lot worse TFT displays too, so the Sony Ericsson ones score somewhere in the middle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  W850 display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So just to sum up, on our user-friendliness scale Sony Ericsson W850 scores rather low thanks to the highly uncomfortable navigation pad and the constant creaking sounds which one would not expect from a mobile with that price tag. The only things that save the day for the Walkman is the nice and smooth sliding mechanism, the nice matt plastic, the perfect balancing of the weight and the cool Light Effects feature which is the icing on top of a very typing-friendly alphanumeric cake, if you would forgive us the pun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W850 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to using the W850 as a pure mobile phone, the handset manages to please with ease building on several crucial elements. The W850 is probably the phone with the loudest loudspeaker we've heard recently to start with. Believe us, when we assure you that it's highly unlikely to miss an incoming phone call even in the noisiest of streets. The sound during calls is clear, and as expected, the network signal remained at its maximum in the urban area where we do our tests. The vibration strength is pretty sufficient to do its job. You can set the handset to answer your incoming call automatically when you open the slider, but the strangest of it all is that closing it up doesn't end the call. The only reason for that that we could think of is that the Sony Ericsson engineers didn't want the automatic feature to prevent you talking with the phone closed. The same holds true for the automatic key lock. It engages every time you close the slider as long as you close it from standby view. If you happen to close it while you are somewhere in the menu, the key lock doesn't work at all.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Let's cut to the essence<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in W850 is a standard non-smartphone Sony Ericsson user interface. This is the reason why we would use some excerpts from our previous reviews of Sony Ericsson phones. Of course, we would use the screenshots from W850 for illustration and the text would take into account all the interface specifics of this model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice thing is that the phone has a dedicated Flight mode, which can be turned on seamlessly without even turning the phone off. Even if you have to turn it off for some reason, there is an option that the phone asks you whether you want to start it directly into Flight mode. A substantial difference, let say to Nokia flight mode, is that the phone cannot work in Flight mode unless there is a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Turning the phone on</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In active stand-by mode the screen displays information about the network signal, battery strength, current date and time, plus the next alarm that's due to go off. You can choose to display the clock with large semi-transparent numbers, which take up half the screen but blend with the chosen wallpaper very well. A good thing is that you can set the clock to be seen in the upper right angle of the screen even while browsing through the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Standby view: two types of clock</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the navigation pad in any of the four directions can start a given feature or application according to the user preference. In fact when you start using the phone for the first time, the phone reminds you of that option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Create shortcuts to the pad's four ways</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu itself is made of a matrix grid with 4 x 3 animated icons. All sub-menus are in listed view with tiny icons on the left side. The phone reacts and performs fast in every submenu and application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The main menu ? a listed sub menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several repetitions of applications and shortcuts in the menus, which can be confusing for some users. There are several themes that come preinstalled in the phone. They change the color scheme, the wallpaper and the menu icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main menu icons: two of the preinstalled themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the things, that have been developed a lot, is the Activity menu which has a dedicated shortcut key on the keypad. The Now running tab of the menu offers real multi-tasking. In W800 you could only run simultaneously one regular application and one Java application, for example. Now you can run three Java applications in the same time, which allows for a lot more freedom and flexibility in everyday usage. For example, you can open the browser, open an instant messenger client, listen to the radio and play a game, all at the same time. That's a great functionality that is not seen in other non-OS phones of other manufacturers. The rest of the functionality of the Activity menu has remained the same - it offers quick access to recent events, the web menu with integrated Google search and the My Shortcuts menu which contains a list of frequently used features and can be modified to the user preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    All four tabs of the Activity menu</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A new contact has been added<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface is simple and easy to use. As always, the phonebook asks you whether you would like to copy your contacts from the SIM card to the phone's memory. However you can choose either the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be the default for the phonebook. Both lists cannot be displayed simultaneously. Otherwise, a nice option is that you can make the phone to autosave in the SIM card any new contacts that you save in the phone's memory. You can also have the phone back up your phone numbers on the inserted memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Contacts list ? Phonebook options ? Choosing default contacts</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum capacity of the phonebook is 1000 contacts but you can save up to 2500 phone numbers. Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. Contacts are searched by gradual typing of the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Free memory status ? Sorting names</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, there are five possibilities for the phone number: Mobile, Home, Work, Fax and Other. This is the first tab of fields for the new contacts. The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture and a custom ringtone. The fourth goes for Title, Company, Street, City, State, ZIP, Country information. The last, fifth tab, is for additional information and birth date. When you add the birth date, the phone asks you whether you would like to add it to the calendar and put a reminder for it. That's a good feature and we like it that we see it available more and more often in current phones. When you are browsing your phonebook list, switching between different phone numbers and emails for a given contact is possible via pushing the side ways of the joystick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contact details</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls log is divided in four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. The tabs altogether contain up to 30 call records, which are shared between the separate tabs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Message in a bottle<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All messages, except emails, use one Inbox. No matter what kind of message has been received, it goes to the common Inbox. Only email messages have their own separate Inbox. There is a My Friends feature, which works like an instant messaging application and can be used if your network operator supports it. The phone also offers a RSS feeds reader that in fact uses the NetFront web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messaging menu ? RSS feeds</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start typing a message, first you must choose from the three variants: Text message, Picture message or Voice message. There is no point in that as you can easily transform a SMS into a MMS along the way by simply attaching multimedia objects to the message. The editor shows up to 5 lines en bloc. There is a character counter, which activates when you reach 20 characters before the 160 limit. When you pass the limit a "2 SMS" warning sign comes up for a second to alert you that the message will be divided in two parts. Of course, there is the T9 dictionary to assist the typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Write new ? typing a SMS ? available symbols ? copy/paste options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports POP3 and IMAP protocols. It can also manage several accounts simultaneously. You can choose from downloading only headers or headers and text. The phone can automatically check for new emails at a preset interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Email inbox ? reading your welcome email ? changing font size</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>That must be a Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W850 supports MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC+, WAV, WMA, M4A and MIDI file formats. The Walkman media player is version 2.0 and features improved interface. It has several equalizer presets including the proprietary Mega Bass. It can be set to run in background so you can do other things with the phone while listening to music. When in background mode, there is an indication of the name of the song and artist of the track currently playing in the top part of the screen. The control of the player is intuitive and really easy to use. It even displays the album cover during playback if there is one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Music player menu ? Tracks submenu ? player options ? Mega Bass preset</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are really pleased with the improved user interface. The sound is nice, too. We were even pleasantly surprised with the performance of the external loudspeaker when it comes to listening to music. The mid and high tones sound great and there are even some low ones. There is a certain crack sound when playing music at the highest volume level though. The only music phone we've seen recently to sound better through its external loudspeaker is the Sony Ericsson W950, but then again it doesn't play music as loud as W850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Playing a track ? Sending a file from within the player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of W850 is nice and offers the option to watch videos in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Playing a video: comparing two scenes in portrait and landscape mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio has a memory for 20 preset stations and supports RDS. It also features the TrackID option which records several seconds from the song you are listening to at the moment, connects to the Gracenote servers and should hopefully identify it for you. So if you happen to hear a great song on the radio you can always get the name and artist and even buy it directly online.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Exploring the insides<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have used other Sony Ericsson handsets you won't be surprised by the W850 file manager because there are no significant improvements here. On the other hand if you are still new to SE phones, well let me tell you that they have one of the best non-OS file managers. It allows you to mark files (single or multiple), copy them, move them, and also create and delete folders as you please. There are three tabs of file lists - one for the phone memory files, one for the memory stick files and one mutual for all files. By selecting a given tab you can filter the file list you wish to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The mutual tab ? available memory space</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing your pictures is as easy as ever - you could do that in a list view with or without thumbnails while the file names are visible. You can also choose to view your pictures as a grid matrix of thumbnails in 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 grids with no file names visible. The video files can also be browsed as thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    List view ? thumbnails list view ? 5 x 5 grid view? 3 x 3 grid view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the pictures themselves vertically (in portrait mode) just as you would on any other phone or horizontally (in landscape mode) if you prefer. When viewing the pictures one by one the phone preloads a lower quality preview in order to allow you fast browsing Once you find a picture, you would like to see in its full glory you should stop browsing for a second and the phone would load it with its normal quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing the pictures in landscape mode is much more natural</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even more, up to 32x. Zooming is performed by small incrementing steps. That allows greater control but is kind of irritating since you have to go through several stages before you zoom in enough to check the details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Zooming in: 1x; 2x; 8x; 32x</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interesting thing about the file browser is the Timeline view, which allows you to filter the pictures according to the month they have been taken in. After you specify the month, you could even choose the exact date. That sort of image filtering is offered by computer picture browsers and digital cameras. The Timeline sorting is seen more and more often lately in the recent Sony Ericsson phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Viewing options ? applying a monthly filter ? applying a daily filter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While browsing pictures you can easily do a little bit of editing on them or send them as MMS and email or via Bluetooth and Infrared. You can even upload the selected image to an online blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Available options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you intend to do detailed editing of the picture, the PhotoDJ application is at your disposal. With its help you can easily adjust levels, light balance, brightness and contrast, remove unwanted red-eye effect, apply some color effects to the picture such as negative and sepia, or you can add a frame or a text to the picture.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Regular 2 megapixels<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2 megapixel camera of W850 does its job satisfactory without any bells and whistles. The quality of the pictures taken is comparable to that of pictures taken with K750 and W800 but of course you should bear in mind the lack of autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen better quality cameras from Sony Ericsson, not to mention the lack of autofocus. The camera offers night mode, self-timer, panorama, frames, and burst shooting modes. It also features white balance correction. Several color effects are available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Some camera menu options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shooting is performed in landscape mode by using the camera shortcut button as a shutter key. Of course, you can take a picture in portrait mode too, but the camera menu is meant to be used in landscape mode. Once you've taken a picture with the phone you can immediately blog it on the Internet and thus share it with your friends. The camera options are in a menu that we have seen on all recent phones by Sony Ericsson so if you've had one, you would feel perfectly at home here. Sony Ericsson W850 has no dedicated macro mode, everything closer than say 80 cm from the lens will be out of focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>                Sony Ericsson W850 sample photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sorry, no macro mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with W850 are captured at a low QCIF resolution. You can choose if you would like to limit the video duration in order to fit it on a MMS message or whether you would like to make unlimited recordings. The options for the video camera are pretty much the same as those for the still camera with very minor differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson W850 video sample, 130KB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should also mention the video calls camera on the front of W850 since after all we are reviewing a 3G phone here that is capable of making video calls. We are pleasantly surprised by the functionality that this tiny VGA camera offers. The other party's video feed is viewed in a large frame in the middle of the screen while you see your own image in the very same time in a small frame in the lower left corner. There is also a possibility to view your own image mirror-like, meaning that the image gets reversed and looks as if you are staring at yourself in a mirror. It's much more natural that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also digitally zoom your image at a 2x degree or choose to replace your live video feed with a picture of your taste or with a live feed from the main camera. You can also do that during an actual video call. The options don't end here. You can further on control the exposure compensation of the camera or even switch it into a night mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 3 different video quality modes: Smooth, Sharp and Normal. Smooth delivers a smoother picture flow while Sharp provides more detailed images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Regular setup ? replacing the two pictures</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wired or not<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides 3G and GPRS for fast data transfers, video calls and streaming content support, the handset offers the usual connectivity capabilities such as the USB support and the Infrared port. The handset supports OMA DRM 2.0, which makes it compatible with almost all online music shops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we tested, the integrated HTML Access NetFront Internet browser is at a good level and it does its job more than all right. It has a lot of options - you can view the pages fullscreen with no menus showing and you can even browse your Web pages in landscape mode. It has WAP and picture modes. It supports content created for HTML 4.01, xHTML 1.0, CSS and Java script, WAP 2.0. The supported security protocols are SSL/TLS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Smart-fit function of the browser manages well with fitting the web content into the screen, but usually distorts the page layout and design too much to be really useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, the first appearance of W850 was in the movie "Da Vinci Code", where it was used for searching something with Google, so we decided to put the browser through its paces when it comes to Googling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Integrated Google search form ? Portrait mode ? Landscape mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature is that the browser supports zooming in and out of the Web pages of up to 200%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Zooming in on 140% ? Zooming in on 200%</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we cannot miss the opportunity to take a peek at GSMArena.com through the integrated browser since that has become in some way our in-house way of testing and comparing mobile Web browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Browsing GSMArena.com</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset supports Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP profile, which means that you could use a stereo Bluetooth headset with it and that is something you don't see in every phone nowadays. Another notable thing about the excellent Bluetooth support is the Human Interface Device (HID) profile which allows the phone to be used as a remote control for PC and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Further on, the phone could be used as a Bluetooth modem for Internet access of a PC or a mobile computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The integrated "Remote control" application</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has support for local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC while the remote synchronization is with remote servers. The USB connectivity of the phone has two modes - one for file transfers and one for USB Internet - to put it simply, the second one is for using the phone as a modem. A great feature that we see in every new Sony Ericsson phone nowadays is the capability to update the firmware version of the phone over-the-air, meaning you can download the new version through the phone itself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mixing fun and work<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This phone offers many time organizing features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Alarms, Calculator, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Applications and Code memo. The Calendar offers monthly and weekly view. As we have mentioned above, when you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone asks you if you wish to add it in the calendar too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Organizer menu ? Calendar monthly view ? Calendar weekly view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Reminders can be put as Subjects. Notes are written as messages; there even is the T9 to assist writing. There are five alarms available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat it on chosen days of the week or everyday. Furthermore, you can add text and a picture to the alarm as well as set its behavior in case the time that the alarm is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Voice recorder doesn't have any limit in the duration of the recordings since all the free memory is available for the purposes of the application. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one, which you have probably already seen. It offers the basic functions with no bells and whistles.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>An interesting option is to use the flash LED for more practical purposes - for example, as a flashlight in the dark. You can even set it to flash repeatedly the SOS signal.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As far as the additional applications are concerned, an interesting and funny one is the FaceWarp application, which is used for manipulating portrait shots by adding funny faces and grimaces.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Some other applications include the MusicDJ, VideoDJ and the Music Mate. VideoDJ is for making video clips from scratch or for editing existing recording using special transition effects and by adding background music. It can be a very amusing application. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Music Mate application is designed for those aspiring to become musicians. It offers a guitar chords database, a piano pitch and a metronome. You can use the database to check the finger composition for any guitar chord, as well as listen to how it sounds.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gaming frenzy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are several preinstalled games on the phone. The first one is Juiced, the famous racing car game. The second one is QuadraPop, which is a Tetris-like game, which can be rather amusing if you are in the right mood. Then comes a river rafting game, in which you should take your boat through the river obstacles. And finally, the Treasure towers game, which is a classic jump'n'run title with nice graphics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are really pleased with the first attempt of Sony Ericsson at sliders. W850 is a nice handset offering loud and clear music reproduction and a rich retail package. When it comes to music you would hardly be disappointed since the Walkman 2.0 music player, the stereo Bluetooth support, and the 3.5 mm audio jack make this baby among the best of non-OS music phones. In the same time, it offers rich functionality, which won't disappoint the tech buffs. If you are willing to get over the bad ergonomics of the navigation pad, the Sony Ericsson W850 might just be your next Walkman phone.</paragraph>
