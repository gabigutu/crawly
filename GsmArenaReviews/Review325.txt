			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K530 is a decent looking mid-range handset. It will mostly be favored by those of conservative taste. The new addition to the K series offers 3G support video calling and good entertainment features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K530 was among the models Sony Ericsson presented in June. A mid-tier handset of decent equipment, it will appeal to conservative users with its classic neat exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson K610, which spawned the K530</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Loveable at first sight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Regardless of the lesser number in the model ID, we're looking at the Sony Ericsson K610 next of kin. The changes in design and functional equipment are almost insignificant. The good thing about K530 is that it's gotten rid of the cheapo look of its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Standing at 102 x 46 x 14 mm and weighing 92 g, the neat bar has near perfect oblong shape with rounded edges. It's all made of plastic but that doesn't seem to upset the solid and robust feel of the handset. Even hard pressure on the casing won't result in alarming creaks. Our test unit was the Warm Silver variety, which did complement the refined exterior of the device. The other available color version is Thunder Black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side lining of the front panel starts to recede right above the keypad, making the screen unit project from the casing. The resulting asymmetrical side view of the handset is a very likeable choice of design. The right side of the handset hosts the shutter key and the volume rocker. On the left, you'll find the Memory Stick Micro card slot, hidden beneath its protective cap. Topside is the minute power button; the classic Fast port connector and the neck-strip eyelet are at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Almost half of the neat back panel is taken by the black battery cover with the manufacturer logo badged on it. The only adornment rearside is a dimple-patterned crosswise strip. Alongside the loudspeaker grill and the external antenna connector, you'll also spot the 2 MP camera lens. It is, sadly, rather unprotected and will require extra care handling the phone and a lot of cleaning. Cost reduction went another step further and we're disappointed to not have at least a LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the easy-to-remove cover is the 950 mAh Li-Po battery. It is said to provide 540 minutes of talk time or 395 hours in stand-by. Video calling time is up to two hours. The SIM card is placed under the battery. Taking it out proved quite a trial.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Cascading keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad comes off quite well, consistent with the neat and reliable feel of the handset. Controls and alphanumeric keys are put together in an unbroken layout. The middle-column keys are notched out at the sides for better touch orientation. Bulging at the bottom, each key has a slight tilt, making the rows of alphanumeric buttons tangibly terraced. It's really a very user-friendly keypad offering great touch orientation, although some may frown at the keys being too tightly packed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pivotal navigation element is the D-pad. Its confirming center is ample and sufficiently elevated from its surroundings to ensure reliable keypresses. The couple of soft keys follow, along with the usual Back and Clear keys. The last two controls are the Activity Menu key and Internet key. All control keys are easy to operate, and the keypad is backlit in strong and even white.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No indication of missed calls, again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We just can't speak highly of the Sony Ericsson K530 display. The manufacturer has chosen to integrate a low resolution screen of 176 x 220 pixels. Topped with the unenviable 31 x 39 mm surface, it really pulls off a rather grainy, coarse imaging. The screen is enclosed in a black frame, which it makes it look bigger than it actually is. QVGA resolution would've surely suited this screen better. It displays 262K colors of high saturation. Brightness levels can be set from within the menu. Above the display is the minute secondary camera for video calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer has yet again abstained from displaying the digital clock permanently in power-saving mode. The screen will go completely blank after a certain time, so you'll need to power it back up to check for missed events. The illuminated digital clock will appear on screen by pressing the volume rocker. Why a little LED notification of missed events is missing is beyond us. Seems like most users, us included, would've welcomed such a perk.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: playing on the same string<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in K530 differs in no way from the rest of the handsets by the Swedish-Japanese maker. The status icons and shortcuts on the display are the good old stuff. The different size options for the digital clock are the only interesting thing. Users will likely welcome the possibility to use animated wallpapers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Stand-by display with big and small watch</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: Some screenshots have been borrowed from Sony Ericsson K550, in which the menu and user interface are in practice identical with K530.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a grid of 12 color icons and, again, is teeming with animations, which you can't turn off. The preinstalled themes don't alter the menu icons this time around. Deeper menu levels are displayed with text, enhanced by a small icon at the beginning of every row. A pleasing detail is the displaying of current time all across the menu system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Standard main menu ? submenus feature a highlighting tab for selected items</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Menu is accessed through the Confirming center of the navigation key, or the right soft key. The left selection key opens Recent calls. The directions of the navigation key can be assigned shortcuts to selected applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shortcuts to frequently used functions can be placed under the My Shortcuts tab of the Activity Menu too, which allows multitasking applications. The rest of the Activity Menu tabs are New Events, Running Apps and Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Activity menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K530 can be set to prompt you every time you switch it on whether you would like to start it into flight mode with all transceivers disabled. The inconvenience here is that the flight mode too requires an inserted SIM.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To us, the camera of the Sony Ericsson K530 was a disappointment. The handset doesn't belong to the Cyber-shot elite and is equipped with a common-or-garden 2 MP camera without autofocus and lens cover. It could've at least been given a LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp; Camera viewfinder and settings pop-up menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K530 is held horizontally when taking pictures, like an ordinary digicam. The shutter key is placed on the right-hand side. The maximum picture size is 1600 x 1200 pixels. The pictures fail to impress with quality. The high compression takes its toll and photos suffer a considerable loss of detail. In pictures of grass for example, pixelation is quite discernible. Colors come out well however. Of course, problems with macro shots are inevitable given the lack of auto focus or of a dedicated macro switch. The camera settings are accessible from the toolbar at the bottom of the viewfinder, the available options for each feature appear as a popup list. Inside the camera menu you can select picture size, white balance, exposure compensation, picture quality, self-release timer, night mode, shutter sound, color effects, picture frames, and burst mode. There's a panorama shooting mode for combining three shots into one wide picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.2x digital zoom is available only with picture size set to VGA. Pictures can contain info on the time and date of taking, and allow white balance correction. They are saved in the phone or on memory card. Pictures are easy to send via Bluetooth, email or MMS. Sending a picture to a blog and direct printing on a PictBridge compatible printer are other available options. The phone memory is the thrifty 16 MB. Users will have to consider buying a memory card, since none is shipped with the handset. Sample pictures taken with Sony Ericsson K530:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Applying exposure compensation</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Night picture with night mode off and on</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw no improvements in the video recording. The K530 captures video in 3GP format; recording length is unlimited and depends on the available memory only. Users will have to put up with the dismal resolution of 176 x 144 pixels. When shooting video, digital zoom and exposure compensation are enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> File manager and photo gallery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture gallery for viewing your shots is under File manager. Depending on the user preference, 4 or 9 pictures are displayed in thumbnail view, or a list of photos with details about the time they were taken. A handy option is the Timeline view allowing you to browse your pictures chronologically. User can opt for fullscreen view or use the slideshow function.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: copy-paste, no tweak<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No novelties are to be expected in telephony. The phonebook capacity is 1000 contacts and up to 2500 phone numbers. Contacts can be assigned different details: up to five phone numbers, three emails, a web address, postal address, a note, birthday, ringtone, thumbnail or a video recording, which is played during an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Phonebook ? editing a contact ? searching ? phonebook menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are listed by first or last name. Using phone memory or SIM is user-configurable. Displaying contacts from both memory locations simultaneously continues to be impossible. Contacts are gradual-typing searchable. The built-in handsfree, call recorder and voice dialing are sure to be appreciated. Sony Ericsson K530 is tri-band enabled (900/1800/1900 MHz). Following in the footsteps of its forerunner K610, it also features UMTS support (2100 MHz) and video calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Call log</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing profiles let you set ringing volume and filter incoming calls. Choosing the incoming call and SMS alerts is traditionally outside the ringing profiles. Apart from the preinstalled 40-tone polyphonic ringtones, any MP3, WMA, AAC or AMR file can be set as an incoming call alert. The same applies to message alerts. Ringing profiles are quick to access and switched between using the On/Off button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: all walks of life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No news can be good news. All-round messaging functionality is on hand: text and multimedia messages, an email client, RSS feed reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Messages menu ? SMS and MMS editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text messages you compose or read display in 8 lines on the display. Regretfully, the SMS editor gives no options regarding font size. The T9 dictionary is there too. A long SMS you typed can break down to up to 10 parts. Chunks of text can be easily inserted in a multimedia message. Character counter displays only when you're 10 characters from the maximum character count. EMS support is also there, small images can be embedded in the text. All the user-available memory is at hand for storing received messages. The user can opt between all new events displaying in the Activity menu or in a separate window. The MMS editor, as seen here, first appeared in the Sony Ericsson K800. Underneath the compose window there's a taskbar, which is used for inserting images, photos, videos or sounds. It also allows you to directly launch the camera or voice recorder. Inserted objects are viewed on the display, the MMS preview mode provides a very convenient control. Maximum MMS size is 300 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Email client and RSS-feed reader</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client allows setting up several accounts, but sadly can't handle them simultaneously. Choice of email alerts, automatic mail check and downloading message headers only are all available for the user to set. No worries sending full-res photos as attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RSS reader is also part of the Messages menu. There are several bookmarked channels, but the list is fully user-configurable. Getting them organized in groups is however impossible. Updates can be manual or automatic at a preset time. Viewing feeds is quick and friendly, clicking on a message launches the internet browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tells the weather, reads a book<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before we get to the organizing functions, let us mention now preinstalled applications. AccuWeather provides weather updates and up to 3-day forecasts for specific locations. The service is free, but charges for the data transfers may apply with your carrier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K530 features the Audible application, allowing downloads of digital audiobooks. You may choose between over 35,000 titles from the Audible.com database. The service requires registration and membership fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the basics, the calendar offers a monthly, weekly and daily view. There's only one type of entry: appointment. Each appointment can be assigned a subject, start time, end time, location, description, reminder at a preset time, as well as a daily, weekly or monthly repeat option. The week can be set to start on any day. The downer here is that custom sound alerts are impossible to set. The preinstalled reminder sounds are very short and dull.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Organizer menu ? calendar and alarm clock</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Tasks and a Notes function are also present in the organizer. Tasks can be assigned reminders but can't be assigned priority. You can also make and save notes. Both notes and tasks can be sent. The alarm clock is quite elaborate. It is easy to set up to 5 alarms with independent repeat patterns. Additionally, each alarm can be assigned a description to be displayed at a selected time. Under organizer you'll also find a stopwatch, timer and calculator. In the Entertainment section is where the voice recorder can be found, along with an application allowing you to use your handset as a remote control via Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Funny fellow<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Entertainment is entrusted to the music player, the built-in FM radio and Java games. The music player is quoted to support MP3, WMA, AAC, AAC+ and eAAC+ formats. Tracks can be filtered by artists or listed all together. Creation of playlists is enabled. The player can run in the background, and features Loop and Shuffle modes, as well as stereo enhancement and equalizer settings. The equalizer offers presets and manual setting options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entertainment menu ? music player and FM radio</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music can be enjoyed on the loudspeaker, or on the headphones you get in the standard package. The headset is the usual standard unit we've gotten used to with the Walkman series handsets. They perform commendably and can be used as a handsfree too, thanks to the wired remote and microphone in the middle of the cable. The A2DP-enabled Bluetooth makes wireless stereo headphones an available option, tpo. You can also opt for the recently announced HGE-100 headset with integrated GPS receiver, which make for a really intriguing accessory. The Sony Ericsson K530 is the first handset to be released with support for this headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entertainment is enhanced by an FM radio with RDS functionality. The phone will automatically scan the FM frequency band and store the 20 stations with the strongest signal in the locality. You'll have to name them yourself though. Unfortunately, the radio features no equalizer, mono reception is available besides stereo though. Radio can be minimized, and can play on the handset's speaker, though the headset should be plugged in. It will probably be with the radio that the TrackID application will be most used for instant recognition of currently playing tracks. As we've outlined before, charges for the data transfers apply.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;TrackID function ? video player </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player works with 3GP and MP4 formats. Video recordings can be viewed full-screen. Two Java games come preinstalled. One of them is about solving detective cases, the other is the well-known 3D tennis, now tweaked up to allow multi-player mode via Bluetooth. Already standard inclusion features for Sony Ericsson, the MusicDJ, PhotoDJ &#x438; VideoDJ applications are also at hand in the K530, allowing users to play with pictures and video recordings, and create custom polyphonic ringtones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>jBenchmark test results:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Without EDGE, again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical of the Swedish-Japanese maker, EDGE is consistently pushed down by UMTS. There are still enough users around who will prefer the slower rates for the better coverage. So, in K530 you'll have to make do with the ageing GPRS class 10. Close range transfers are handled by Bluetooth and the Fast port connector. Once the phone's been connected to PC, you'll be prompted to choose between Phone mode, File Transfer and Print for printing pictures via PictBridge. Thanks to the USB Mass Storage support no driver installation is necessary. In File Transfer mode however the phone is unusable and can't receive calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NetFront internet browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web access is ensured through WAP and the NetFront browser. The latter is elaborate enough and offers a wide range of options, including landscape view of web pages. The impossibility to minimize it is the only shortfall of the browser we identified.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization of contacts and calendar with MS Outlook goes without saying. The needed software is available on the included CD. There is also a QuickTime player for the videos recorded with the phone, and the Disc2Phone computer software for transferring music from CDs or PC to your phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Not much of an effort<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>That's about how things are at the Sony Ericsson developing center. Designers are called upon to improve looks, developers are tweaking up the firmwar&#x435;, but somehow the user interface and functions tend to be ignored. It's not the fault of K530 only. It's safe to say, most of the new releases suffer the same weakness. It's been quite some time since we last saw a real innovation, except in strictly high-end handsets. The same, of course, holds true about Nokia. Recurring criticisms seem to meet with indifference. Sony Ericsson K530 is very similar to the K610 we tested a little over a year ago. Save for the better exterior, the few novelties are the FM radio, A2DP-enabled Bluetooth and Track ID. Will the few improvements justify the price tag?</paragraph>
