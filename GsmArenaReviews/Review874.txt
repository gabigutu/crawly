			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Three generations on, the Notes are gadgets that people can't seem to get enough of so a new, less expensive, version must be good news for everyone. Well, except perhaps the Note II. Anyway, what was rumored as a Lite version of the Galaxy Note 3, seems to match the description with lower screen and camera resolution, but a brand new chipset with six cores operating simultaneously, sees the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo step out the shadow of its premium namesake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo is not a mini version per se - with a Duos version in tow, it's more like a new branch in the Note family tree. A fork down the road that shouldn't have been a surprise - Samsung would be fools to not try and capitalize on a popular and successful line of devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A six-core CPU based on ARM's big.LITTLE architecture, an 8MP camera with 1080p video and a SuperAMOLED screen are still solid credentials if you're not going to compete at the very top of the league. The S-Pen is of course a prominent part of the deal. Granted, the screen resolution is down but 720p isn't too bad. The screen is decently sharp, while promising to place less strain on the battery and keeping cost down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another downgrade that's hard not to notice is 4K video recording - the Note 3 Neo does 1080p at most but, then again it's clearly targeting users who wouldn't spend over the odds just to get the latest tech - and that's the kind unlikely to have a 4K TV at home anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the spesc certainly arenn't bad for a handset that was known as Lite back in Rumorland. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo's spec sheet promises to bring all the Note 3 productivity and most of its multimedia goodness at a more affordable price and in a form factor that's a little easier to handle. You'll be missing on a few bangs and whistles but there are plenty remaining.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ready to move on? The physical starts right after the break. We'll look at the Galaxy Note 3 Neo's exterior and controls, and see if the new screen is really that much of a step back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Galaxy Note 3 Neo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises in box the Galaxy Note 3 Neo ships in: a powerful 2A charger, a USB cable and a headset are all waiting for you inside. A bunch of spare tips along with the metal tool needed for replacing them complete the list of accessories.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you put the original Note 3 and the Neo next to each other the size differences are negligible. The Note 3 Neo's screen diagonal is a fraction of an inch shorter, which results in a tad smaller footprint compared to the original Note 3. At 148.4 x 77.4 x 8.6 mm, the Neo is just 3.5mm shorter, about 2mm narrower, and 5.5g lighter. Overall though, at this size the weight and thickness differences are hard to spot when the two are side by side, let alone feel when you handle just one of them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new member of the lineup looks exactly like the original too - it has the same faux-leather battery cover, complete with the stitching. The S-Pen compartment is in the same place at the bottom as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the regular Note 3, the Galaxy Note 3 Neo is entirely made of plastic, which on the rear cover has been designed to look and feel like leather with almost real stiches. The illusion isn't as good here as the new back is a bit harder which takes away some of the feel. The good news is it will still handle damage very well and even survive a few drops - no trickery there. The frame around the screen has the familiar brushed texture and, this time around, Samsung went for a similar finish on the sides - instead of the grooves on the Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Almost the same size and weight as the original, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo is near impossible to operate with one hand. Samsung has of course tried to make up for it with the familiar set of layout optimizations and has even supplied a dedicated one-hand mode. What that does is reduce the interface so that it only takes a part of the screen so you can reach for the furthest angle. You get very precise control over the size of the window and also get to pick which corner it occupies so it can actually be useful at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bottom line though, if you are getting the Neo hoping for more comfortable single-hand operation in everuday full-screen mode, don't set your hopes too high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pull the S-Pen out of its compartment, several shortcuts pop up on the screen, so the stylus can often be the fastest way to perform certain tasks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the 5.5" display you'll spot the earpiece, a 2MP front-facing camera capable of 1080p video recording, the proximity sensor, and the ambient light sensor. There is no motion sensor, which means no Air Gestures on the Note 3 Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, we find the typical Samsung three button layout consisting of a physical Home button with capacitive Back and Menu keys each side. As usual the home button has an aluminum frame for a subtle accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Galaxy Note 3 Neo has a bunch of familiar controls placed exactly where we found them on the Note 3. There's the power/lock button on the right hand side on which the thumb nicely rests and the volume rocker on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top features another mic and the 3.5mm audio jack, plus the IR blaster that Samsung has been putting on lots of Galaxy devices lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom has the microUSB 2.0 port for connectivity and charging purposes, the primary microphone, the loudspeaker grille and the S-Pen compartment. The Galaxy Note 3 Neo will do without microUSB 3.0, which is obviously flagship-grade equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The faux-leather finish has made its way into the entire new tablet lineup. We like it way more than any glossy alternative. The Note 3 Neo's back features the 8MP camera lens and a single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pop the back cover open to reveal the 3,100mAh battery (just 100 mAh less capacity compared to the Galaxy Note 3) along with the microSIM and microSD card slots. The slots are stacked on top of each other like they are on the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom slot holds the microSIM card, which is blocked by the battery, while the top slot is for the microSD card, which can be removed even with the battery in place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo is just 0.2" smaller than the Galaxy Note 3's, keeps the Super AMOLED matrix but takes the resolution down to 720 x 1280. The 267ppi is below Retina quality, but we can confirm the screen still looks pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The matrix has the full number of sub-pixels in the same unorthodox arrangement as the screen on the Samsung Galaxy Note II. This means that the screen is exactly as sharp as the ppi number suggests with no PenTile to bring down the perceivable sharpness further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The display matrix under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that, much like the other recent Samsung smartphones, the Galaxy Note 3 Neo comes with four different screen mode presets, so you can tune the saturation to your liking. You can either go for the full AMOLED bang or opt for realistic color representation. This really is the best of both worlds and we can't imagine anyone being unhappy with the presets available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED panel on the Galaxy Note 3 Neo isn't the brightest around, but unless you plan to use the screen as a torch (and you better stick to the LED flash for that), that's hardly a big deal. The surface over the display is pretty low on reflections, so contrast remains high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under direct sunlight the Galaxy Note 3 Note is able to retain excellent contrast and stay legible even in the most brightly lit environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 Neo battery has the reasonably big capacity of 3,100mAh, just 100mAh less than the original Note 3 phablet. This is the first time we see in action Samsung's hexa-core Exynos 5260 chipset though, so we didn't know what to expect. Fortunately Note 3 Neo's battery life turned out to be great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lightweight Cortex-A7 cores and the energy-efficient Super AMOLED HD screen surely helped the Note 3 Neo to achieve indeed an impressive result even though it isn't on par with the Note 3 flagship. The endurance rating of 74 hours means the Galaxy Note 3 Neo should manage just over three days on a single charge if used for one hour each of calls, web browsing and video playback daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find the complete test breakdown over here in our blog.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Pen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Pen is the signatory feature of any Note device, phablet or tablet, and the on the Galaxy Note 3 Neo is basically identical to the one found on the regular Galaxy Note 3. It can be placed back into its compartment either side up, the button facing up or down. The stylus is made of matte plastic, with a finely grooved top part. Its sides are flattened for better grip, while the button is positioned on one of those flat sides and is easy to reach.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Neo runs on Android 4.3 Jelly Bean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo comes with the same Android 4.3/TouchWiz combo as the one the Galaxy Note 3 launched with. We'd be surprised if Samsung didn't release an Android 4.4 KitKat update shortly after the launch, given that the original Note 3 has been enjoying it for a few weeks now, but there's no official confirmation of that just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes our usual demo video to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the lockscreen, which supports widgets and shortcuts. You can assign either a live wallpaper, a static one or you can set TripAdvisor to display beautiful images from around the world. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message overlaid on the wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen supports multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in pure Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance, S Health, S Planner and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the greeting message on the lockscreen by altering its text, font and color. You can also disable the personal message altogether and remove the time and date info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is business as usual and hasn't seen any changes. At the top there are five (or eight in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. There are more than five toggles, of course, you can swipe horizontally to get to the others. Or you can tap the expand button, which reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, 21 in total. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can remove this slider to get more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks mostly the same if you're coming from a Galaxy S4 or a Note 3. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub, S Travel, etc. There's wrap around feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode with all homescreen panes visible simultaneously. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button - you can choose a different homescreen as the default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is the same we saw it on the Galaxy S4, S4 mini and Note 3. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders. You can also disable apps straight from the App drawer, which is a good feature because they won't take any RAM or appear unwanted in the Task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also maximize space in the app drawer by stacking apps into folders. You can either drag icons on top of each other in edit mode or you can check multiple app via the create folder option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works the same as on a homescreen - it gives you a glance overview of all panes as thumbnails. You can choose to have your app drawer ordering to custom, alphabetical grid or alphabetical list. There's a dedicated downloaded pane too, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can judge how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 Neo comes with the latest phablet version of the Multi-window multitasking feature, which allows you to have two apps running on your screen at the same time. You can even launch two instances of the same app - i.e. you can have two Internet browser windows next to each other. The two instances thing works only on select apps though - currently My Files, Internet browser and Hangouts are the only one to support it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is are dedicated shortcuts that let you switch the places of the two opened apps and copy stuff from one of the opened apps to the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed there is pretty decent app support for the multi-window service at launch with even more supported apps on the wayYou can move the small arrow that brings up the drawer with the Multi-window apps to make it easier to reach with your thumb. You can also move the whole drawer to the other side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu features the familiar a tabbed interface. On top you get four tabs - Connection, My device, Accounts and More and you can find the relative features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the My device tab. It makes navigating the settings menu much faster and more intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A particularly cool feature that we first saw on the Galaxy Note 3 and continues to live on the Note 3 Neo is the one-hand operation. It can minimize the whole interface with a simple double swipe and you are effectively making the Note 3 Neo use only a corner of its screen for its UI. The volume buttons are also brought to the tip of your fingers so you can operate the handset as if it was a 4" (or slightly more - custom resizing is available) rather than 5.5" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's a really useful feature and will be appreciated by all those that love the huge screen and its excellent multimedia performance, but need to be able to operate their smartphones with one hand frequently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you are on your default homescreen pane, a tap on the Home key will bring you to the Flipboard-like My Magazine full-screen app. It aggregates articles from a pre-defined set of sources - it supports popular topics such as sports, movies, food, music, games, science, etc. plus top picks of your social network accounts and S-App personal content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is very responsive, everything happens instantaneously and there is no lag to be spotted whatsoever.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S-Pen, Motion gestures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now let's talk about the S-Pen features. The Note 3 Neo has every S-Pen-enabled app that came pre-installed on the original Note 3. Once you pull the S-Pen out, as usual the OS will pop up the Air Command menu. The menu is available everywhere throughout the UI too, you just need to press the side button on the S-Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Air Command menu is a virtual ring with five shortcuts - Action Memo, Scrap Booker, Screen Write, S Finder and Pen Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Memo lets you write stuff and then use it to initiate an action - i.e. add a contact name and number to your phonebook, or check out an address on Google Maps. You just need to mark a part of the text and send it to one of the supporting apps. The handwriting recognition works impressively fast and accurately - it handles just about everything you throw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrap Booker lets you add pieces of your screen to... well, a Scrapbook. You don't need to take a full screenshot - just mark the stuff you need. The Scrap Booker will automatically extract pictures and text from the selected area and will save them to one of your Scrapbook categories. You can then add an optional memo to every scrapbook entry you create.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen Write allows you to start writing on the display no matter what screen you are on. You can either use a clean sheet or use a snapshot of the screen you are currently using. It's the best tool for taking quick memos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Search is a local search that'll browse through all the content on your Note 3 Neo with preset filters. It can search in all S-Pen content you've added (including notes, scrapbook pages, etc.), messages, multimedia, settings, phonebook, even the internet. Naturally, all handwritten stuff is an easy job for the S-Search. You can even search for symbols you've drawn with the S-Pen. That last one seems to work quite slowly, however, and unless you actually use the scrapbook quite a lot you probably won't need it that often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last element of the Air Command menu is Pen Window. It lets you launch a mini window with one of the supported apps by drawing a rectangle on the screen. The Galaxy Note 3 Neo will then fit the floating app in said rectangle (correcting the aspect, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video showing how these new Air Commands work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Note is an application that allows you to create and customize notebooks. There is a total of 9 preset notebooks to choose from but you can also create your own custom look from images in your gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After you're done creating a notebook you can go ahead and fill it with notes, drawings, images on which you can draw or doodle, etc. The app gives you a nice little preview of the notes inside a notebook when you swipe it down in the main window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside a note you can choose from a variety of pens and brushes, adjust the color and thickness of the line, insert text in a number of fonts, make the text bold or italic, etc. You can create custom shapes, have an undo and redo option and choose to delete whole lines or just parts of the content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can insert just about anything into a note - voice memos, images, video, charts or illustrations, maps, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrapbook lets you keep any content you browse through on the Note 3 Neo's screen. You need to select anything on the screen of the Note 3 Neo by pressing the S Pen button and the software highlights it and gives you a prompt to send it to Scrapbook via an image. Air Command also gives you a shortcut to Scrapbook and lets you highlight anything on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add notes to a scrapped image as well as tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app lets you import images from your phone or SD card storage and sync with your Samsung account but to our disappointment won't let you sync your scraps and tags to Evernote, Springpad, Google Keep, or any other third party app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo comes with a number of other advanced motion-driven features, but makes do without the air gestures introduced with the original Note 3. Those only had limited application, so they won't be missed too badly in everyday usage, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air View is here though and lets you learn more about images, emails and folders by hovering your finger or the S Pen over them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is called information preview (e.g. SMS text, calendar entry text and so on). It also works for previewing videos just by pointing to a spot in the timeline, and it lets you checking out the next track in the music player by hovering over the next button (available with the previous button too). There's also the use for for previewing folders, speed dial contacts, and magnifying links in web pages. Air view detects fingers or the S Pen around 3cm away from the screen, so there's no danger of accidentally tapping the screen when you wanted to use Air View instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Smart Stay and Smart Rotate features are enabled too. Stay prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face (great for reading) and Rotate uses the orientation of your face rather than accelerometer info to decide how to rotate the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Scroll is yet another feature that leverages on the front-facing camera - it allows you to scroll up and down by tilting the phone or by tilting your head. It's a bit hard to get used to it initially, but once you do it's rather useful for certain scenarios - particularly when your other hand is busy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final Samsung-exclusive feature is dubbed Smart Pause. While watching a video, it uses the front-facing camera to track your face and will automatically pause the video when you look away. Look back and the screen and the playback continues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are a number of motion gestures, which are not exactly new. There's direct call (dial the contact currently displayed on the screen by lifting the phone up to your ear), smart alert (makes the phone vibrate when you pick it up if there are missed events), zooming and panning in the gallery, a shake of the phone to refresh the list of Bluetooth devices and muting alarms or pausing music playback by putting the phone face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pause the music player by putting your palm on the screen. A palm swipe takes a screenshot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo is the first device we meet running on the hexa-core Exynos 5260 chipset. It has two Cortex-A15 @ 1.7GHz and four Cortex-A7 @ 1.3GHz at disposal. Unlike previous Exynos chipsets, the one here supports HMP, which means that it can run all six cores simultaneously. The Note 3 Neo is running Android 4.3 Jelly Bean rather than 4.4 KitKat, which may hurt it a bit, but on the other hand, since it has a lower-res 720p screen, so the Mali-T624 will have an easier job. We'll see how that works out in the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we start with the CPU. The Galaxy Note 3 Neo single-core performance isn't as impressive as we would have hoped for, but the relatively low clockscpeed is probably to blame here.

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo has shown great potential in performance and even though it isn't the greatest performer we've met, it's still has a lot power under the hood and with the 720p easing the stress on the GPU, it's smooth sailing for the majority of time. And the web browser experience is really impressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 Neo comes with a couple of virtual assistants, one of which is the company's own S Voice. That one can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even tell you a joke.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual phone and it has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy Note 3 Neo to answer a call, snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, gives you the weather forecast for your city and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is. Reminders are also available in Google Now since one of the most recent updates.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The phonebook on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo packs an incredibly wide range of features. The four tabs on top are still present and provide access to the Phone app, Groups, Contacts and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has kept the swipes in the phonebook, enabling quick dialing (right swipe) or sending a text message (left swipe), which are really handy on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contacts feature, upon a tap on the contact picture, shows a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, text, email or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all the details available. There are two tabs here - the first one is the About tab, which shows the person's photo on top. If configured, the right tab displays their latest updates from social networks or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. You can use the back button to go to the full contact list, or tap in the top left corner, just like in vanilla Android. The top right corner has shortcuts to contact editing and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the phone book finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt you to join them. Furthermore, there are a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like the previous version of TouchWiz, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reject list blocks certain numbers from calling you. It works great with preset numbers and you can also bar unknown numbers. There are third party blacklist apps in the Play Store but it's nice to have this out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a specific vibration pattern as an incoming call alert, just like you would select a custom a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too. You can also assign a custom vibration to specific contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the Galaxy Note 3 Note is really something. It's feature set is almost overwhelming at times, but its interfaces is simple enough so you can only use the features you need. Once you find your feet around you will appreciate having cool extras like call barring, which stock and most other forms of Android lack.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo offers top notch quality and very decent. Earpiece volume is great and voice quality was excellent with Samsung's in-call equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone app on the Galaxy Note 3 Neo looks the same as on the Note 3. Smart Dial is available and works as advertised - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Direct Call is here too and lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts or reading/composing a message. If you use quick dial but forgot which contact is assigned to which number, you can use Air View as a quick reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too and taken care of by the newly added S Voice, which activates on a double tap of the home button. All you need to say is "Hi Galaxy" and speak your command (e.g. "call Dexter"). It takes a while to process voice commands but it has more uses than other voice-recognition apps for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off when you hold it next to your ear during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo through our loudspeaker test and were pleased with the results. It's quite loud and even managed to get extremely close to the HTC One's dual front speakers. You can find more about the testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward and hasn't been fiddled with too much in the latest TouchWiz version. The user interface is simple: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard of the Galaxy Note 3 Neo is mostly the same as on the Galaxy Note 3. It displays an additional row above the letters for numbers - kind of like a full-fledged computer keyboard does and we found that to be really convenient and a great way to leverage on the huge screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a built-in Swipe-like mode which tracks your finger and guesses the word you're trying to type. This feature works great but has limited language support for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool option is the floating keyboard that takes up less space on the screen and can be moved around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're not too keen on on-screen keyboard, you can utilize the power of the S-Pen and use it for text input. Samsung has integrated a feature across the entire user interface, which enables any text field to accept handwriting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hovering with the S-Pen on any text field displays a handwriting icon; tap it, and use the S-Pen to write a message or put down a phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use S Voice to dictate your message or use Google's built-in voice recognition software if you don't feel like typing. Since this is a Jelly Bean device, you can also use voice typing without a data network connection, as long as you have downloaded the necessary language packs in advance. Samsung also provides the option to change the default input method.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has left a lot of room for customizing your messaging experience. You can choose from different bubbles and background and can use the volume button to increase or decrease the font in conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However you don't get the option to choose your own colors for either the conversation bubble which we would've liked to see. The background can be changed according to your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're composing a new message you can use the Translate option to translate it into another language. The same goes for messages you've received. This feature probably won't see much use but it's there you ever need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What might see more use, is the Direct call feature. When you are reading a message from someone, you can automatically call them back by just lifting the phone up to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the dialer, the Messaging app has built-in blacklist. You can block some numbers (or all unknown numbers) and even add specific phrases to be blocked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has grown handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen but is mostly unchanged. It supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a specific message will archive it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Email app can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email app supports Air view, which upon a hover over an email gives you a peek into said email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper-left corner you'll find a context menu prompt, which lists all your folders. It's not accessible through a swipe from the side so you'll need to tap the mail icon each time you want to gain access to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone landscape activates the split view - the left side of the screen shows the list of emails, while the right side shows a message.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is alive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Note 3 Neo has the same layout as the one on the Galaxy Note 3. It can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails. Air view works in the gallery as well. You can hover your finger above an image and you'll get a bigger thumbnail preview of the image or you can use it to peek inside folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that albums' stack of photos but a swipe to the right will reveal a bar on the left with all the albums. This means you can change albums without going through the gallery homescreen every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a press and hold on a picture the gallery gives you the option to select multiple images, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo is a joy. The screen is ample and the Super AMOLED can give you colors punchier than anything else on the market. If you know what "color profile" is you can enable the Adobe RGB screen mode for accurate color rendering, if not you can just enjoy the vibrant colors of the default setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily retouch photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also make a memo on top of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The My Files app hasn't changed a great deal - it is an efficient and simple to use file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy Note 3 Neo is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC and Wave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album and Playlist criteria but there's also Folder support (which is more often found on third party players) - it's quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on many of the Galaxy Note 3 Neo competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options - a timescroll of the song, play/pause and back/forth controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo has a couple of features that will improve your listening experience further. One is Smart Sound, which equalizes the volume between tracks. The other is Adapt Sound - it plays a series of beeps (both high and low frequency) and asks if you can hear them. This way the phone can map the capacities of your specific headset and fine-tune its output for optimal sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the calibration is complete, the Galaxy Note 3 Neo shows you the kind of gain you're receiving by keeping Adapt Sound on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player lacks DivX and AC3 codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player, found on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo, has the last watched video on top for quick access. Under it there are three tabs - personal (showing you the videos on your local storage), Download (which lets into the Videos store) and Nearby devices, which shows the PCs and players on your local Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is here, showing you previews of your library so you can easily locate a specific video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too. The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the large, high-res screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chapter preview detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hovering your finger over the timescroll lets you preview part of the video in a small thumbnail - just like YouTube videos do when you hover the mouse of your computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is here too - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video are move it around, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo audio output is every bit as impressive as that of its more premium namesake. The phablet aced the first part of our test, posting perfect scores top to bottom. The volume levels were about average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's next to no degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. Outside of the little extra stereo crosstalk, the Note 3 Neo is as perfect as in the first test. And its volume levels are even better for the scenario, making this a great overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo comes with an 8 MP camera sensor good for photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixels in its native 4:3 aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is well familiar to all Samsung users at this point. A single viewfinder handles both still and video capture, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution as, if you're shooting full resolution 8MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The majority of the settings is located in the top left corner. Still, there a number of interesting options here like the setting for the volume rocker to act as a still shutter key, a video shutter key or a zoom lever. The HDR mode (Rich Tone) can be set to save a normal and an HDR photo or just the HDR one. Another interesting option is contextual file names - the Galaxy Note 3 Neo will name photos with your location (the GPS needs to be on for this to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the cooler settings are found in two places. The first is the Mode button under the shutter keys. It brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each mode comes with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops he text but is faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other one is the arrow at the bottom of the screen, which brings up a row of color effects. Each effect gets a live preview, so you can see what the particular scene will look like with it. There's a download button so you can grab more effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the shooting modes we've seen on previous Samsung phones like Best Photo and Best Face, which snap multiple photos and let you pick the best one (in the case of Best Face, you can tweak each face in the photo individually). Beauty Shot does some automatic beauty touch up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we get into the more interesting shots. Eraser helps you remove moving objects (e.g. tourist waling into your shot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drama mode takes a moving object and clones it several times. Note that the resolution for this mode drops to 1080p. Another way to capture moving objects is Cine Photo, which creates cinemagrams. The result is an animated GIF file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound &amp; shot captures a photo and records ambient sound. It sounds pretty cool - for example, you can hear the sea gulls in a beach photo or the roaring of car engines if you're at a race - but we had problems sharing the shot. All the Galaxy Note 3 Neo would send is the still image, a JPEG, and the sound remains on the phone. Shame that Samsung didn't use the standard Audio note feature of JPEG photos for this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One important shooting mode that's not found in the carousel is double shot. It snaps a photo with both the front and the back cameras, so the person holding the phone can be in the shot too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now to the most important part - image quality. The samples have a lot of detail in them even in less than perfect weather, noise is kept well under control. White balance is pretty accurate and colors are pretty pleasing - striking good balance between natural and punchy. These are in fact some of the best 8MP snaps we've taken in a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR stills come out great as well. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo does well to develop the highlights that would otherwise be clipped, while shadows are only improved slightly, so contrast is still great and images don't look too flat or unrealistic. HDR images have an excellent amount of fine detail, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panoramas on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo can go as high as around 10 MP but only if you shoot in portrait mode as the images come out just over 1200 pixel tall, while in landscape panorama shooting you're getting an average of around 600 pixel height, which isn't ideal. 

 In either mode you can shoot images around 8000 pixel wide. The stitching is seamless and the software uses the gyroscope and accelerometer to guide you and warn you if you're going too fast or moving off the right line.

			<subsectionTitle>Photo comparison tool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo is more than capable of carrying its own weight in our Photo Comparison tool. You can see it does pretty well against the other top notch 8MP snappers and even trades punches with some of the 13MP cameras out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo in our photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent 1080p videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo is capable or recording 1080p@30 fps videos. The clips have a bitrate of around 17 Mbps, audio is captured at 124 Kbps with a sampling rate of 48 kHz with 2 channels (read stereo). You can also capture 6MP images during video recording. Here is a sample of such snapped picture:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The detail levels in the videos are very high, while colors are pretty good and the framerate very consistent. Contrast and white balance are great too for some impressive footage overall. It's not quite as great as the 4K produced by the Note 3, but the Neo does pretty well in its own league.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 1080p video we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched 1080p @ 30fps (10 seconds, 22MB) video sample taken straight off the Galaxy Note 3 Neo.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison tool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo enters our video comparison too. There are plenty of 1080p camcorders you can compare it, but it has proven to be among the best with great detail, colors, contrast and white balance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo has an impressively long list of connectivity features. Let's start off with the basics - quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G. The 3G connectivity is backed by HSDPA (42Mbps downlink, 5.76Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 3 Neo has an LTE-A-enabled version too, which uses the Exynos 5460 chipset (the Qualcomm MSM8228 comes without 4G). The LTE-A speeds are 150Mbps down and 50Mbps up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers a/b/g/n as well as the latest ac standard, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA are part of the package, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third-generation phablet also has Bluetooth 4.0 LE. It incorporates Bluetooth 3.0, but also includes the efficient Low Energy mode. It also supports the high-quality Apt-X audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo lets you share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the devices back-to-back. You'd need two S Beam-enabled devices to get this to work. You can share with other NFC devices as well, but the functionality is limited to what is provided by the stock Android Beam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AllShare allows you wirelessly stream all sorts of multimedia content to your connected stereo or HDTV. You can also mirror your mobile device screen to the bigger HDTV via Wi-Fi Direct and the widely supported Miracast protocol - that would even allow you to play mobile games on the biggest screen in your living room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Link (previously known as AllShare Play) automatically syncs all the multimedia content on your device to Samsung servers so it's backed up and also available for watching/listening on your other Samsung devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL-enabled microUSB 2.0 port, which lets it output content to an external screen by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. Sadly, there isn't one included in the retail box so you would have to buy it separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MHL port has yet another feature - it enables USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (there isn't one in the box) but this one is fairly straightforward - you plug it into the Galaxy Note and plug a standard USB cable on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB keyboards and mice are also supported - a mouse cursor appears on the screen of the phablet and you can use it to do all sorts of stuff around the interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hassle-free web browsing experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser hardly has changed, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo has the hardware specs to propel it to great heights of user experience. The Super AMOLED display with great colors makes reading a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air view, Smart scroll and Smart stay all work in the browser, the first of which lets you simply hover your finger over a web element and it will act as if a mouse cursor was over it instead, which is great for websites not optimized for mobile devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for plug-ins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. The brightness and colors option gives you four different presets to adjust the display according to your preferences. Automatic brightness is an option, too, and works only within the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome also comes pre-installed and offers pretty much the same web browsing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Office Viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 Neo gives you only the Polaris Office viewer functionality, rather than the full-fledged editor. The viewer does not show up in your app drawer, but instead only opens when you select the relevant document from the My Files app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, you can view most document types, including PowerPoint, Word, Excel as well as PDF. We suspect Samsung will make sure a full-fledged editor is available for download from the Samsung Apps by the time the smartphone goes on sale, but even if it doesn't there's plenty of alternatives in the Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Planner fills the role of your calendar app, and can be viewed by Day, Week, Month or Year, or by a list of all your upcoming tasks or events. The small squares for each date give only limited info on the events for the day, but thanks to Air View you can point to a day to read the full description of events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. There's also a World clock, stopwatch, and timer. They are easy to work with and can come in handy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo features a wide array of advanced features and applications that really make it stand apart from other flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the coolest apps is called Group Play. It shares various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room, but unlike DLNA it's interactive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One use case is to play a music track on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo and use multiple phones as speakers. You can pick the role of each phone (e.g. left channel, right) all the way up to surround sound. This way you can control the music from one phone but use the loudspeakers of all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the other phones will need to support Group Play - the phones communicate over Wi-Fi (your Galaxy Note 3 Neo becomes a hotspot that others connect to) and the pairing is done via NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More useful are the options to share a picture or a document - you can have the same picture appear on everyone's phone and you can draw over it if you need to highlight a certain element of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, perhaps the coolest feature of Group Play is that it allows for multiplayer games to be played on several phones simultaneously. Of course, only supported games work - there was a poker and puzzle games preloaded on our unit with Asphalt7 and Gun Bros offered as other games that support Group Play multiplayer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi Vision on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo allows you to stack up several devices and get a bigger resulting screen area for your content. If your friends rock a Galaxy Note 3 Neo you can team up and create a cool video watching experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Samsung Link, another way to share content between devices. Unlike Group Play, Samsung Link is intended for personal use. You can link the phone to a computer that is synced with Dropbox, SkyDrive or SugarSync and remotely access content on that device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator will help travelers - it can translate between two languages using either typed text or by using speech recognition. It can read out the resulting translation too, if you don't think your Korean accent can cut it. S Translator supports all the widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and, of course, Korean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung WatchON is the primary app used with the built-in IR emitter on the top of the phone. The app starts out by asking your zip code and pulls up a number of TV service providers in that area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is so that the app can show you a TV guide with shows currently on or upcoming on the channels offered by the service provider. You can read a description of the show, check out its popularity in up/down votes (and vote yourself, of course) and comments. You can also set reminders for shows you want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the key element of the app is the IR remote control functionality. The app can control TVs, DVD and Blu-ray players, streaming media players and air conditioners. Devices are organized by rooms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really liked about the app is that it knows some home setups are messy - some let you change channels with the TV remote, others require you to use the set-top box remote for that. Same for the audio, you might be using the TV to output the sound or an AV receiver. The app will ask about your setup and present a unified remote control interface even if you have multiple hardware remotes to control all the devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, S Health is Samsung's home-brewed health and fitness tracking application. It starts off by getting you to create a profile which includes all your vital statistics, such as age/weight/gender and level of activity, plus your calorie consumption goals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides a pleasant interface which gives you an at-a-glance look at your progress, as well as walking, exercise, and fitness trackers, plus you surrounding environmental influences, such as temperature. S Health also supports a number of optional accessories, which enables it to give even more detailed info on your status.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation is where GPS comes in handy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in couple of minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. The barometer, however, can speed up GPS locks even without a data connection. We gotta say, we didn't experience any issues with the GPS performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (or larger) than most dedicated SatNav units, with excellent sunlight legibility and plenty of storage, money spent towards satellite navigation should go to buying a good app rather than a separate SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 Neo comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play is where the Android apps are<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps. From music / video players, to file managers and various tools, you'll always see something worth a try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has naturally included its own Apps store. It features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far lower number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo is more than adequately powered and has a solid screen, which took the cut in resolution amazingly well. The S-Pen and the software built around it place the Neo among the productivity leaders on the market. The sort of experience that Muti-Window enables and the extra dimension added by the stylus (proper Wacom-tech at that) make this a combo that rivals will have a hard time matching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 Neo does pretty well in the multimedia department too. The 720p screen may not be the sharpest around, but there's nothing quite like the punch of AMOLED. And a camera that only sounded good on paper, turned out excellent in real life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's most impressive about the latest Samsung phablet though, and that's a feat it shares with most of its Note siblings to this day, is its lack of glaring gaps. As hard as we tried, we weren't able to put a finger on a single aspect of its performance that was compromised beyond repair in an attempt to meet budget. Okay, portability really isn't spectacular, but that's all you can expect with a screen this big. If anything, Samsung did a good job of keeping the bezels as slim as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yet, for all the praise we didn't spare, we can't wholeheartedly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo over its Galaxy Note 3 sibling. With early rumors putting its price at just about ?50 less, we don't see much value-for-money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because, while the AMOLED and S-Pen give it an edge over most competitors, the Neo has nothing on the Galaxy Note 3 except for the fact that it's a bit smaller. But those few millimeters come at the price of half the screen resolution, 16GB of internal storage, 4K video recording, and 5MP of still camera resolution. Not to mention that the chipset, while hardly a slouch, is not quite as good as Snapdragon 800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, if the Galaxy Note 3 Neo is to be a sensible purchase, it should be aiming for the ?350-?400 price bracket. The savings of ?100 will make more people consider living without the premium features listed above and the Neo will be standing in the ring against opponents it can beat. Case in point:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro has a higher resolution (but not higher quality) camera, and a great 1080p screen, but it's over a year old now and it's stuck on a pretty old Android release. Overall, where you stand on TouchWiz and the S Pen will probably decide this close battle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus G Pro E985</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo N1 is a closer match in terms of looks, but with no expandable storage it almost leaves you no choice but splash ?480 on the 32GB version. And while its 1080p screen is gorgeous, it can hardly justify that sort of difference over the Note 3 Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo N1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are even more phablets with 1080p screens in the market, but those are mostly in the premium segment. The Nokia Lumia 1520 is great, but comes with a price tag to match, while the HTC One Max is let down by its camera. The Acer Liquid S2 is in the mix as well, but good luck finding it in most markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Lumia 1520 ? HTC One Max ? Acer Liquid S2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, all thing considered, if Samsung does get the pricing right, it has the chance of bringing the phablet to a spot where it will be virtually free of competition. Aim too high, however, and they'll end up with a device, which has no reason to exist besides a test case for the new hexa-core Exynos chipset.</paragraph>
