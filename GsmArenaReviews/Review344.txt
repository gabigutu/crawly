			<paragraph>The new ultra-slim Samsung captivates with its graceful silhouette, to unveil a multitude of functions!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Early this summer Samsung launched their new Ultra Edition II series, which was featured at this year's 3GSM congress. Slim shape is the underlying trait of all models in the bunch, but they represent different form factors. Along with the Samsung U100, the Ultra Edition II includes the U300, U600, and U700. The first review we did was of the leading member of the group - the Samsung U700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultra Edition II by Samsung:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 (which is short for Samsung SGH-U100) is the successor of Samsung X820. By the way, Samsung U100 is also dubbed Ultra 5.9, to underscore the staggering 5.9 millimeters the device measures in thickness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>True Lightweight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of design, Samsung U100 is a true chip off the old block. When placed next to each other, the two handsets have a lot in common. The keypad is where difference is most obvious: that of the Samsung U100 is fully level with the surrounding surface, in line with the latest trends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung SGH-U100 gets to be appreciated little by little. You'll be interested before you know it, but hardly at first sight. Having used it awhile though, you'll marvel at its size and weight. The height and the width of the phone are nothing to cheer about, but its slimness is stunning - the blistering 5.9 mm! Samsung U100 is a millimeter thinner than the Samsung X820 and is the thinnest handset currently in the wild. It is 106mm high and 50mm wide. It weighs the astounding 57 grams so be warned: you'll be tapping your pocket ever too often to make sure your phone is still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung does a little cheating, though. There's a strip at the top of the phone, where the camera is located. The strip stands out a millimeter from the rest of the body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side trimming of the phone is solid, sapphire-blue plastic. The rest of the casing is also plastic with fiberglass reinforcement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel is accentuated by a decorative chromium element next to the earpiece. The in-call earpiece also serves as a speaker to play all sounds of the phone. The display beneath the speaker is horizontally orientated.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A tricky keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keypad layout is the standard for all Samsung models. However, the keypad is so flat, almost dead level with the surrounding surface, that it's likely to cause typing errors. The hardest nut to crack though is the really minute Confirm Key inside the D-pad. All due criticism aside, the display performs nicely and we liked the consistently quick response of the phone. The backlighting is superb; it's homogenous and powerful enough; key symbols are clearly visible in the dark. Energy- saving is enabled, as the backlighting is configurable to turn on at particular times of the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few controls are placed at the sides of the handset. The top and bottom are completely bare of connectors or buttons. On the left side is the dual volume key, which controls both the in-call and the keypad tone volume levels. The same key can also reject or mute incoming calls. On the right is the camera release key, which opens the camera application and serves as a shutter button. Here you'll also find the universal connector combining a USB port, charger socket and an earphone plug. This connector is hidden under a protective cap. A notable downside, the phone is somewhat difficult to use with the earphones plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing at the back, that sticks out a mile, is the jut at the very top. It's home to the camera lens (3.2 mega pixels) on the left and a self-portraits mirror on the right. The battery compartment cover is at the foot of the backplate. The handset is powered by a 690 mAh Li-Ion battery. It's quoted by Samsung at 4.5 hours of call-time and 300 hours of stand-by. In reality, we were forced to charge the phone every other day, using it as follows: a few SMS a day, several 5-minute calls a day, and a half-hour connection to a PC via Bluetooth each night. The battery is fully charged in approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: ergonomics by Samsung<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 sports a horizontal TFT display with resolution of 220 x 176 pixels. Even though QVGA would have suited this display far better, it is still pretty good and worth a compliment. It features excellent colors (262K) of impressive brightness, saturation and contrast. The only problem here is the poor legibility in bright sun, but it gets partly resolved by the special Sunlight mode. This feature adjusts the color scheme, darkens or lightens certain colors, and brings brightness up a jot higher than the maximum level. Sunlight mode is activated from deep within the Settings menu. Bear in mind that it won't do nice indoors, in twilight or in no light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the essential signal coverage and battery status, other icons may appear on the display to indicate GPRS/EDGE availability, roaming status, ringing profile, keypad lock, music player in use, etc. At the bottom of the display the functions assigned to the context keys are showing. Both color and font style are user-configurable. Any picture or animated image from the phone can be used as background. The phone has four clock layouts to choose from. Samsung's uGo application will update your background image to display a famous landmark of the country you're currently in. So if you're in the Czech Republic you'll be seeing The Old Town Square in Prague, or the Tower in Pisa if you are in Italy. What's more, the entire background image is animated: the sky gets overcast, then the sun comes back out, birds fly by during the day, buildings are illuminated at night, stars shoot across the night sky... There is also an option to set a permanent month view of the calendar to show on the stand-by display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Three visualizations of the stand-by display</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left context key opens the main menu, while the right one accesses the phonebook. The directions of the D-pad can also be assigned optional shortcuts. Only the Up-key is fixed to launch My menu, containing up to four most frequently items. The Confirm key starts the WAP browser in stand-by mode. Again, we find this bizarre and irritating, but Samsung continue to produce their handsets with this inconvenient key setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Main menu: each item has its own color</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; A sample of sub-menus and other setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu can be displayed as a 12-icon grid or as a list. The phone offers two color schemes: a stylish black one, where only the selected icons pop up in color, and a more playful, white one. We find the black version cooler, by far. On the other hand, the white one seems more usable under sunlight. The submenus only display as text and are controlled through the Left and Right keys of the D-pad. If you don't like this minimalist dropdown interface, you can choose to select an entry and access a full-size sub-level. Shortcut keys are available too. The phone responds instantly, except for the activation of the camera, which takes about 4 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;A light graphic theme, a view at the main menu in the form of a list in the second image</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user should be aware of the different function of the Confirm key and the left context key. Both will open an item, but the Confirm Key simply selects, while the left context key also saves your selection to the phone memory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: fit to please the most demanding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual, we kick off with the phonebook. Samsung U100 takes up to 1000 multi-field entries. Each contact can be assigned first and last name, 5 phone numbers, email address, and a note. Moreover, images can be attached to each contact, callers filtered by using different ringtones. Contacts can be organized into groups too, but the groups cannot be used as call filters. Each group can also be assigned a particular image and ringtone. The phone displays all names simultaneously - both those saved in the handset memory and the SIM card. Searching employs gradual typing. The speaker's audio performance is very good, with maximum volume levels sufficient for comfortable use in a noisy environment. Deep inside the menu of Samsung U100 are the Hands-free and the voice recorder options. The voice recorder can be used in calls. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Dialing a number - contacts are searched automatically ? call register ? phonebook menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>When dialing a number, it displays in a variety of font styles: fountain-pen handwriting, drinking-straw scribbling, or in the form of paper notes being pinned to a message board. If the dialed number exists as an entry in the phonebook, Samsung U100 displays a tag with the contact's name. That's a relatively new feature, as it lacked in the previous Ultra series.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Searching a name in the phonebook ? a view of a particular contact ? creating a new contact</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each incoming call can be muted or rejected. The reject-call-with-SMS feature is available. The call register displays up to 30 entries of each type (missed, received, and dialed). It also shows the number of multiple events from one and the same contact. Besides, Samsung U100 can display an itemized list of all incoming, outgoing, and missed calls, recipients of all sent messages and senders of all received messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Context menu for names in the phonebook ? setup options for groups ? speaking </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 doesn't have 3G support; the presales piece we tested was designated for GSM 900/1800/1900 MHz networks. Another significant drawback is the absence of ringing profiles. Ringing profiles boil down to a quiet mode activated by holding the hash key. Incoming call alerts are user-definable. The options are: ringtone only, vibration and then ringtone, ringtone and vibration, or vibration only. Samsung U100 supports 64-channel polyphony, while any MP3 or AAC file can be set as a ringtone. Offline mode is also available, to use aboard airplanes for example. Bear in mind that this last option is illogically positioned deep in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging-friendly in many ways<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 works with all message types. Standard SMS are typed in 4 lines. Characters are counted down from the unusual number of 1836; the number of chunks a longer message breaks down to (up to 12 available) is also shown. The phone offers a T9 editor with rich dictionary. Samsung U100 supports EMS, so tiny black &amp; white images and animations can be inserted in each message; text can be formatted too. The keypad does require practice but, generally, typing should not be a burden. Even so, texting addicts may as well look for alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Message menu ? My messages ? Folder with received messages </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory dedicated to SMS stores up to 1000 messages, shared by all folders. Any sound file in the phone can be set as an incoming-message alert. The assigned tone can further be set to repeat every one or two minutes, until the message is read. The repeated alert option can be deactivated, if needed. MMS can be assigned a different alert to distinguish from SMS. Incoming SMS are displayed in 5 lines. You can switch between messages by pressing the asterisk (*) and the hash (#) keys. In other words, you need not close the SMS you are reading to open another one. An extra feature allows you to set up to 10 numbers, messages from which will be automatically deleted when received and you'd never get to even learn about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading SMS ? typing SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos in full resolution, videos, text, and sounds can all be sent via MMS. Attachment size is limited to 300 KB. Each MMS can contain a number of pages. Received MMS are saved in the same inbox as SMS. MMS from particular numbers can be blocked as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Creating an email message</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client handles multiple accounts and supports POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP with SSL and TLS. Entire messages or message headers only can be downloaded in regular intervals. The phone sends and receives attachments of maximum 300 KB. Messages can be filtered by sender and subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another pleasant function is zooming in on message text by way of the dual key on the side. This function activated by a single press and full zoom-in makes font really enormous.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Planning: day, week, month<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar is the main organizing application. The one in Samsung U100 is as good as in most Samsung mobile devices. It offers a monthly, weekly, and daily view. The week starts on either Monday, or Sunday. The calendar offers three types of events: meeting, anniversary, and task. The calendar stores up to 100 items of each type. All events can be set to alert you in advance; meetings can further be assigned daily, weekly, and monthly repetition. The calendar also has a built-in task manager. Tasks can be displayed separately, assigned a priority, and marked off once accomplished. Synchronization with MS Outlook is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Alarm clock and calendar&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 has 5 alarm clocks; any sound can be used for the alarm, which will go off even with the phone switched off. Day-specific alarms are user-configurable, too. The phone will store 100 text notes of no more than 100 characters. The phone also has a very good calculator, a voice recorder, a world time application, a unit converter, a countdown timer, and a stopwatch with meantimes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; More extras&nbsp;</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera of great agility<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 carries a 3.2 megapixel camera. The maximum available resolution is 2048 × 1536 pixels. The camera interface offers a great set of features: 6 picture size options, 3 quality levels, white balance, exposure compensation, ISO setup, frames, color effects, mosaic-like images, etc. Digital zoom and timed release function is available too. There's no autofocus, though. You can choose between three shutter sounds or turning the shutter sound off. Pictures can be exported via Bluetooth, email, data cable, or printed directly through PictBridge. The camera also records video with maximum resolution is 352 × 288 pixels (CIF) in MP4 format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample images:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all the camera has to offer, though. The phone features a Picture editor full of effects (mist, ancient-looking or negative, solar effect, moonlight, etc.), styles (oil-painting, spot and noise elimination, relief, blueprint, paint-brush, spotlight, magic stylus,), various distortion effects, and a partial rack focus effect. Images can be further edited in terms of brightness, contrast, colors; you may even insert text, clipart, smilies, etc. Samsung U100 is so loaded in terms of photo-editing, that it won't be an overstatement to say it has a mini Photoshop inside. And that is still not all. The last application worth our attention is the so called Stamp. It allows you to merge two pictures into one. The result can be very creative and cute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;The Picture editor helps you modify images straight in the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are superior photo mobiles on the market, but the Samsung U100 takes really good pictures. Leaving the lack of auto focus aside, the most serious downside of the U100 camera is noise. There's not much you can do to improve sharpness and color saturation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Browsing files and pictures (the latter can be visualized in full-screen mode too)</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fun: music, TV, Java<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 features a good music player that allows minimization. Tracks can be arranged in playlists, shuffle &amp; repeat mode are available. The music player works with MP3, AAC, AAC+, and e-AAC+ and WMA. You can enjoy your music on a relatively good loud speaker. A proprietary headset is included in the retail package, but you can also use stereo earphones via A2DP Bluetooth profile. The enclosed earphones will hardly satisfy music freaks, but they will do for regular users. A microphone and a call-control button suggest you could use the included headset to call hands-free too. The Samsung U100 hasn't got a universal connector, meaning you won't be able to use third-party headsets. The phone offers an equalizer with three modes (classic, jazz, and rock), as well as an enhanced stereo function. No FM radio in the U100.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 also plays video records in 3GP and MP4 formats. These can be fast-forwarded and viewed in a full-screen mode (by pressing the hush key). The internal memory count of only 70 MB is a downer for the multimedia functions of this phone and there is no memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone can be connected to TV through a special cable, which you don't get in the standard retail package - a common practice for TV-out enabled Samsung phones. Once a TV connection has been established, you will be able to display the content of the phone on the screen. PAL and NTSC color encoding is available. Sound is played too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six pre-installed games in the phone, but most are in demo versions only. One of the most popular Samsung games is the BobbyCarrot logic game. Freekick is a penalty shootout game, Asphalt is a racing one, Midnight Pool and Mini-golf Las Vegas are also there. Here is more information on Java capabilities:</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data and other<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 has only GPRS and EDGE support, both Class 10. A low-end Ultra Edition II, it lacks UMTS or HSDPA support. There is no Infrared port, either. No wonder given its ultra-slim body. Still, we have Bluetooth v2.0 supporting all possible profiles, including the wildly popular A2DP for listening to music on stereo headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;Internet browser ? setup options for Bluetooth</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung provides the PC Studio software package for data synchronization with PC. Transferring music and images is done via Bluetooth, anyway. You can transfer files to and from the handset via the data cable so you'll hardly ever need to install the above mentioned software. PC Studio is crucial for synchronizing Samsung U100 with Outlook, though.</paragraph>

			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph> Synchronization with a computer</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WAP browser is quite good; it manages both simple Internet pages and the WAP 2.0 protocol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 offers excellent handling of PDF and MS Office (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) files, as well as of most common image formats. Browsing is fast, except for panning and zooming, which seem to take a few extra seconds. Documents can be rotated too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last feature we look at is the so-called intelligent search. It unveils each section of the phone contents step by step, including the stuff stored in the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph> A smart function for searching the entire contents of the phone</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung U100 scores high<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 is the slimmest handset yet. It takes a while to really appreciate its strengths, but its design and construction will surely be worth admiration for quite some time. It has many usable, even if not overwhelming features. As Samsung U100 carries little memory, ringtones seem to be a downer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 scores high on features and usability. You'll get to discover a practical detail day after day. Control is very comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U100 is an interesting alternative to lifestyle phones. It is aimed at users on the lookout for fresh, compact and well-featured handsets at a reasonable price - much like the Samung X820.</paragraph>
