			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>They made a promise and kept it. What can we say ? nice phone this Nokia 5250, but not an N8. Yeah we know, we need to be respectful and professional. But it?s easy to be a jerk to a 100-euro smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Symbian-powered Nokia 5250 is bottom of the smartphone barrel. The low price suggests the feature set is going to be pretty spartan. Which doesn?t mean it?ll fight in the shade. It?s rather going to get into brawls with some pretty basic dumbphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The question here is who?s ready to sacrifice most of the features that make a smartphone, to save a few bucks. Alright some of Nokia?s touchscreen smartphones have been going around for peanuts but the 5250 is the lowest bidder by far. Some of the value-adding options don?t cost that much any more. But the Nokia 5250 encourages exactly the opposite kind of thinking. No budget is too tight and no feature is too important.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being affordable is a big plus for a product and a short but focused spec sheet can be an advantage as well. After all, some people get confused by too many features while others just don?t need them. And they might be glad to have the 5250 around. So, the Nokia 5250 is the right phone for the right person. As indeed every other phone out there is designed to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no Wi-Fi, even 3G is missing from the specs sheet. And you won?t find an inbuilt GPS receiver either. But the bare minimum is covered. You still get quad-band GSM support and stereo Bluetooth and a decent 2.8 touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2 megapixel snapper lacks autofocus, LED flash or geotagging but it can at least shoot VGA videos. There is a great music player, an FM radio with RDS and a reasonably stocked app market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let?s see what?s inside that tiny retail box. And then we?ll take a look at the phone?s build and finish.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 5250 unboxed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 is a no-frills smartphone with a limited set of accessories. There is the mandatory charger, a one-piece 3.5mm headset and the usual leaflets and guides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stylus fans will be glad to see that there's one enclosed with the phone. In fact it tucks inside the phone's body just as you would expect. We fins stylus input old school, but we know many people prefer it - especially with the 5230 smaller screen and not-so-thumbable Symbian UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no microSD memory card whatsoever and not even a USB cable in the retail box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 5250 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Nokia 5250 measures 104 x 49 x 14 mm and weighs 107 grams ? almost the same as the Nokia 5530 XpressMusic. All of Nokia?s current crop of fifty-something touchscreens have similar size and overall styling. When it comes to those, among the things you need to put up with are a disproportionately wide screen bezel and excessive thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 will still fit in a pocket or purse trouble-free. And handling is reasonably comfortable in both portrait and in landscape mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are many similarities between the 5250 and the elderly Nokia 5530 XpressMusic but they will surface once we take a look at software. As far as the design is concerned, there isn?t much that the two phones have in common (save for the size and weight).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 is the ideological successor of the 5800 XpressMusic but the styling is a bit closer to the X6. Chubby but reasonably good looking, the 5250 has a handful of paintjobs to choose from: Dark Grey, Blue, Red, Purple, and White. The glossy black front always stays the same ? the only thing that changes is the color of the back and sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.8? resistive nHD (360 x 640 pixels) display is the smallest touchscreen we?ve seen on a Nokia smartphone. Image quality is good enough though. The screen is vivid and colorful indoors but to work comfortably with text you?ll need a larger font setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is disappointing. Things haven?t changed a bit since the 5530 XpressMusic. And viewing angles could?ve been wider too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 uses a resistive touchscreen as opposed to the capacitive displays in devices like Nokia X6 or the recently unveiled Nokia C6-01 and C7. We have no issues with its sensitivity though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, are the earpiece and the proximity sensor. There is no ambient light sensor to optimize the screen brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to them is the trademark touch-sensitive Media key which opens a drop down menu of shortcuts to media and web.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call and End keys, each side of a Menu key, are the main hardware controls under the display. A press-and-hold on the menu key launches the task manager ? in the long-standing Symbian tradition ? to let you easily switch between running applications and to terminate apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the Nokia 5250 is completely bare, save for the lanyard eyelet in the upper corner. And on the right we find the volume rocker, the lock switch and the camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top features the 3.5mm audio jack, the 2.5mm charger plug and the microUSB port (covered with a protective cap). The phone doesn?t support USB charging. The bottom only hosts the stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the rear, we find the camera lens at the top end and the loudspeaker grill all the way across. The 5250 loudspeaker turned quite a performer, by the way, but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the rear cover is the 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery (BL-4U). Quoted at the impressive seven hours and forty minutes of talk time and 450 hours in stand-by mode, along with 24 hours of continuous music playback, it sounds like a set that won?t let you down. We didn?t have the time to properly test it but the small screen and the absence of power-hungry radios such as 3G, Wi-Fi and GPS certainly makes such claims sound credible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover you can also find the SIM card compartment and the microSD card slot. The memory card is hot-swappable but you can only handle the SIM card after removing the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 is inexpensive and that?s all up front ? there isn?t much in the retail package, lots of features are missing and the phone is completely made of plastic. It doesn?t feel cheap though and does what it says on the tin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a matter of fact, we?re pleased with the 5250 build quality ? surprised wouldn?t be too much. The phone is solidly built and there were no wobbles and creaks while reviewing the thing. The Nokia 5250 handles nicely though it could?ve been at least a tad thinner.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s S60 5th ticking inside the Nokia 5250 and Symbian on touchscreen is no news for most of you we guess. It?s been a long list of phones since the 5800 XpressMusic and quite a number of software updates. So, even if the Nokia 5250 is the cheapest of the bunch by far, it takes advantage of some (but not all) of the latest improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is our user interface video for a warm-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kinetic scrolling is one of the things that took some time to get right on Nokia touch phones. In the 5250 however, it is available almost throughout the user interface ? from file and web browsers through gallery to contacts and even the main menu. Finger scrolling has been improved as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the things that didn't make it to the Nokia 5250 is the widget-enabled homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S60 5th is in essence a direct translation of D-pad and soft-key action into touch. Although it has its benefits, the result is hardly the most fluent and intuitive touchscreen interface there is. Accessing items across the interface is nothing like any other touch platform we've tried. On the other hand, the soft-keys work just fine and perhaps even enhance usability compared to other touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the user experience with S60 5th is a mixed bag and what you think of it will entirely depend on your background. If you know your way around S60, you'll be quite at home with the 5250 interface. But if you come from an alternative touchscreen platform you'll find yourself climbing a fairly steep learning curve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening an item in any of the listed submenus requires not one, but two presses - one to select, and another one to confirm the action. Now that's something that you don't normally see in other touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get used to it with time, but the main issue here is that the interface logic is different when you deal with icons instead of lists. When the opened menu uses icons to represent items as opposed to lists, then a single click usually does the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least kinetic scrolling will make you feel way more comfortable than those first 5800 XpressMusic users.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A familiar homescreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure leaves no doubt you're on Symbian turf. Icons are set in a 3 x 4 grid or a list that you can freely reorder. Screen orientation can be set to change automatically thanks to the accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status icons on the Nokia 5250 are located on top of the homescreen, along with the calendar and the clock. A single press on the clock starts the clock application (which is only a click away from setting up an alarm) while tapping on the date opens a drop-down menu where you can either launch the calendar application or change the currently active profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Contacts bar follows right beneath the status icons. Each contact is represented by the contact photo and their first name - and it's possible to have three contacts displayed at a time but the list is scrollable to left and right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact from the Contact bar brings up a screen with contact info (different from what you get if you select the contact from the Contacts list). It has the contact photo, name and phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further down is an area that shows the communication history for that contact ? both calls and messages. And finally, at the bottom there are the top two lines from the contact?s RSS feed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the Contacts bar, it's pretty much standard Active Standby but with fewer slots. The Wi-Fi manager is missing for example ? the Nokia 5250 is not WLAN enabled. Search and Email setup are available, along with email notification showing the number of unread messages, sender and subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The blank area beneath is reserved for the music player and radio mini apps - they get displayed when either is left playing in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very bottom of the homescreen is the custom Shortcuts bar. Both the Contacts and the Shortcuts bars are optional and can be hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media key, placed above the screen on the right, is a shortcut to the Music player, Gallery, Ovi Share, Videos, and the web browser. It's an excellent control that offers quick access to the handset's multimedia features. It's haptic-enabled too so every time you touch it, you'd feel a slight vibration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we didn?t quite like was that it?s not as sensitive as the rest of the screen so it takes a harder press to respond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 features a task manager, which you launched by pressing and holding the Menu key. The task manager itself is identical to what you get on Symbian S60 3.2 devices. Much like in the previous version of the UI, it appears on top of every pop-up menu. To close running applications use the hardware backspace key or press and hold the app's icon to display two virtual buttons: Open and Exit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated hardware switch on the right-hand side of the device will lock/unlock the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A Symbian phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 phonebook has virtually unlimited capacity and its functionality is certainly among the best out there. The Nokia 5250 contacts list has kinetic scrolling enabled and it?s among the better examples to find on a Nokia touch phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and you can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When searching for a contact you make use of a clever dynamic keypad, which shows you only the letters that correspond to actual contacts. Once you type in a first letter, their number decreases, leaving only the ones that actually make up real contacts names. A really convenient tool indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also assign personal ringtones and videos. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors ? accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: no smart-dial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality is good on both ends of calls, the earpiece sound is crisp and there were no reception problems whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only real downside is the still missing smart dialing functionality. Some may argue it's not as essential on a touchscreen but most of the competition has it duly covered. Not to mention WinMo devices have a very elaborate smart dial system that even searches in your Calls log for numbers that are not in your contacts list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is an option with the Nokia 5250 as with almost any other phone. The voice dialing mode is activated once you press and hold the Call key. It is fully speaker-independent and doesn't require pre-recording the names of your contacts. Bear in mind though, that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a contact, the first or the default one gets dialed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, you can silence an incoming call (or an alarm) by simply flipping the handset over. Also, during a call the proximity sensor makes sure the screen turns automatically off when you pick it up to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the hardware screen-lock switch you can not only unlock the phone but also silence it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 scored an Excellent in our traditional loudspeaker test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. They all share a common intuitive editor which by this point should be quite familiar to everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, there to meet almost any emailing needs. The easy setup we found in the latest Nokia handsets is also available with the 5250. If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your username and password to start enjoying email on the go. The phone downloads all the needed settings to get you going straight away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia 5250.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here might just be the right time to mention the input options on Nokia 5250. The handset offers a standard alphanumeric on-screen keypad, which automatically turns into a full QWERTY keyboard when you tilt the handset thanks to the accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia 5250 offers handwriting recognition, which did a rather decent job, recognizing almost all the letters we scribbled in the box. You can improve its performance by taking the handwriting training ? where you actually show the handset how you write each different letter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sluggish image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of Nokia 5250 is nicely touch optimized and there are sweep gestures enabled for flipping through photos displayed fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort images by date, title or size and you can also copy, move and delete them. Sending them via Bluetooth, email, MMS or sharing them online is also available straight from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default view is portrait but you can go to landscape automatically thanks to the built-in accelerometer. A slide show is also available but it doesn't have as many customizable settings as on some Nseries handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also zoom in the photos to see more detail. Zoom is controlled via either the volume rocker or an on-screen touch slider. In all other cases, images are displayed full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery?s problem is speed. Loading a picture takes a couple of seconds even for small images. If you have a large number of photos it might take ages before the thumbnails are generated. Zooming and panning are not that much faster either. On the other hand, kinetic scrolling has been vastly improved. The real nuisance though is that photos in a folder require a double tap to display ? one to select, another to open.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player stays the same<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 music player is pretty functional but its design could use a little freshening up ? it hasn't changed since we first saw it in the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. With user friendliness such a key aspect of full touch phones, it would be nice from Nokia to add some fun to the mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is automatically sorted by artist, album, genre and or composer and searching tracks by gradual typing is available. You can also create your own playlists in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The process of adding tracks to the library is as simple as choosing the refresh option. You won't need to do that if you upload the music via the proprietary PC Suite application. With the huge number of supported formats you will hardly ever come across an audio file that the phone can?t handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is also supported and if you don't like the default sound of the device you can enhance it by applying one of the five equalizer presets. And if they?re still not enough you can set new ones up in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. However, if you haven?t set the Music Player to appear on the standby screen, you will have no way to control it. Your only option would be to go back to the full music player app using the Task manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To begin with, a 2.8-inch screen is hardly the best thing to watch videos on. The lack of DivX and XviD codec support on the Nokia 5250 doesn?t help either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can use the Ovi PC Suite built-in application that automatically converts all kinds of video files to the format and resolution your phone supports. The automatic converter though seems to compress the videos too much, even at the highest quality setting, and they look over-pixelated but so far it's the easiest way of getting compatible video content to your handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player itself only works in fullscreen landscape mode but, since anything else would have made the widescreen display useless, this is understandable. When in fullscreen, a tap on the screen shows the controls which are normally hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the RealPlayer, you can not only watch the videos saved in the phone's memory or in the memory card but also to stream Internet video content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia 5250 has a neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you're on the go, the 5250 should take care of staying tuned to your selected radio station.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio output of the Nokia 5250 is quite good, the handset passing our traditional test with flying colors. It won't amaze you with loudness, but, considering the clean output both with and without headphones,we are willing to let that go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't matter if you are using headphones or if you have pluged the 5250 in an active amplifier - the frequency response is great with deviations only detectable in lab conditions. The same holds true for the noise level and the dynamic range as well as the total harmonic distortion. Intermodulation distortion and stereo crosstalk increase when headphones come into play, but they still remain perfectly tolerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can compare it to some of the other handsets we have tested so far.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor 2 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5250 has a 2 MP camera for a maximum image resolution of 1600x1200 pixels. There?s no auto focus or LED flash. Hardly the photography enthusiast?s dream, is it? Well, its performance isn?t anything to write home about either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI can be quite confusing with all settings squeezed in a shared menu, which is no match for what some other manufacturers offer on their full-touch handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the range of settings on the Nokia 5250 is extensive enough: from manual white balance and ISO to exposure compensation, sharpness and contrast. Various effects are also at hand, labeled color tones and there is also geo-tagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder doesn't take the whole screen ? a bar on the right is reserved for the touch controls. This way you get to see the whole frame rather than having a part of it cropped due to the aspect differences of the display and the sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a settings button that launches a semi-transparent overlay of all available shooting options and an on-screen shutter key. With the lack of auto focus you might as well use that last one just as successfully as the regular shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No great expectations about the image quality turned out to be the right way to approach the Nokia 5250. The amount of resolved detail is pretty low and the contrast of the photos is a mixed bag. And with the noise also pretty high you get the idea that you better use the Nokia 5250 camera for taking contact pics only.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording is definitely the better part of the Nokia 5250 imaging skills. The phone can shoot VGA at 30fps. Quite good, considering the 2 MP still shots. The relatively high compression results in lots of artifacts, but you still might consider the videos as ok, especially for an entry-level smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in MPEG-4 format and can have automatic or manual white balance. The other available settings are night mode, exposure and color effects.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Poor connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 is quite cheap in terms of connectivity. Wi-Fi and GPS are missing and ? if you don?t have a data plan ? you?ll be better off buying a Nokia 5530 XpressMusic instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go for the 5250 however, you will be disappointed to find network data speed is limited to GPRS and EDGE. We guess all those features are sacrificed for a nice price tag, but we?re yet to see how things shape for the Nokia 5250.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only good news about the Nokia 5250 is the 3.5mm audio jack and the bundled quality headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity comes down to USB v2.0 and Bluetooth. There?s also a memory card slot, which can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates. Unfortunately, USB charging via the USB port is not possible ? not that there is a USB cable in the retail package anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable web browser hobbled by EDGE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S60 web browser is decently usable, especially now that is also offers kinetic scrolling. There is still quite a lot of work to do before it is able to rival the best in class. The Android and iPhone browsers are miles ahead in terms of user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 browser has very good page rendering and boasts some nice features such as different font sizes (5 options), auto filling of web forms and a password manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in RSS reader will handle your feeds, while the download manager keeps things in order. There's also a popup blocker, but no open-in-a-new-window option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A minimap is available for finding your way around elaborate pages and the Find on page feature is welcome. The visual history is a nice bonus that can help you easily find a page you've visited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now we get to Flash support. Yes, there is Flash support and it?s way better that it was back on the X6. The YouTube videos we?ve tested did well with almost no dropped frames, but the loading time was excruciating. Unfortunately the small screen and resolution won?t allow you to fit the whole YouTube screen in there. But we don?t think you?ll go watching Flash videos over an EDGE connection anyway. The mobile version of YouTube is an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another upgrade over the X6 web browser is the better kinetic scrolling. It now works fine and manages to catch up with most of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double tapping on a block of text zooms it in on screen, but again, the zooming routine treats the whole page as an image and the browser doesn't refit the paragraph text to fill the screen properly (the so-called text-reflow). As a result, when you zoom in you still need to scroll sideways to read it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S60 5th edition organizer is pretty well stocked although its applications are already in need of refreshment - especially on a touchscreen. Some of the apps are starting to look boring and dated, having had the same interface for over 3 years now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The developers are still hesitant to put the touch input of Nokia 5250 to some good use and maybe add some cool new features. They have only gone as far as to touch-optimize the S60 3rd edition apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes ? monthly, weekly, daily and a to-do list, which allows you to check all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are four types of events available for setting up: Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a great unit converter and calculator, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, set-off day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go. This is quite convenient for, say, setting up your wake-up alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, the number of alarms is not limited. Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply turning your phone over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're also clients for Facebook, MySpace, Shazam, Friendster and hi5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Nokia 5250 does not include QuickOffice, but we guess you can download the free viewer from the Ovi Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the Ovi Store, you can choose between several sections ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization, Recommended and of course, My Stuff, which keeps track of the apps you've already installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Ovi Store client is simple. It?s a list with the name and logo of each app (or podcast, or whatever), the category it's in (Entertainment, Utilities, etc), price and a star rating out of three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting an app, displays more details: a description, info on size, user reviews, an option to write your own review or send the description page to a friend, a list of related apps and a Report issue button, which helps you report fraud, spam, abuse, etc., but not bug reports or feature requests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching the Store is quite easy if the Recommended section and the Related apps list don't get you what you're looking for. Our Nokia 5250 came with very little preinstalled content: just a few apps and one game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, since this is Symbian we are talking about, you can also try some of the numerous software sites online. You can download the apps straight on your phone or on your desktop computer to transfer to the handset later. There are handy tools for reading news, handling social networks, weather forecasts, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 is a phone that expects to impress with nothing but its cheap price. It?s hard to think of it as a smartphone really ? there?s so much missing from the package. It?s a Symbian set though and Symbian is the place to go if you?re looking for a budget smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 takes austerity seriously and thinks and acts small. Keeping a low profile did work marvelously for Nokia in their first attempts at touchscreen. The pioneer 5800 XpressMusic had its flaws but the competitive price made it a bestseller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Later on, there were even cheaper phones to succeed it and there were compromises involved all along. It?s always been a matter of choice: Wi-Fi or GPS, 5530 or 5230. Now, the Nokia 5250 doesn?t even give you a choice. It?s the most basic of smartphones, stripped to the bone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And Nokia clearly didn?t think they had removed enough hardware, so they got to work on the software too. You won?t get any Office application or widget-rich homescreen, not even a voice recorder. It?s an entry-level smartphone and they didn?t want to leave any doubt about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the Nokia 5250 sure is cheap but you get to wonder if it?s cheap enough. It?s up against some of its own siblings and quite a number of dumbphones ? some of which have obviously better specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s get the Nokia phones out of the equation first, For nearly the same amount of cash (yes, the 5230 is clearly overpriced right now) you can get the Nokia 5230. Its specs are the same, except it has a bigger screen, integrated GPS and comes with Ovi Maps free turn-by-turn navigation. Makes little sense really ? unless of course these are phones that will never compete on the same markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5230</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further up the ladder ? but not too far ? we find another Symbian sibling. The Nokia 5530 has Wi-Fi connectivity, a 3.2 megapixel autofocus camera with LED flash and a slightly bigger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5530 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An attractive candybar option ? especially if you?re not keen on a touchscreen ? is the Sony Ericsson Elm. It has an excellent 5 megapixel camera, 3G, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity. It?s not a smartphone, we know, but for some it may not be a big deal.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you are into the Android, the LG GT540 Optimus just got upgraded to Android v2.1 Eclair. It will give you a bigger screen, a better camera and a full-connectivity package including Wi-Fi and GPS. The Optimus costs about 30 euro more than the Nokia 5250 (overpriced as it is now).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Nokia 5250 is a true smartphone, but with its limited feature set, it would hardly make a difference. Its smartphone potential is obviously limited. It's Nokia's way of bringing touch phones to the mass market before a wave of S40 touch phones floods the lower market ranks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while it being a smartphone may not be so great, it certainly doesn't hurt. Besides, with the Nokia 5250 you can count on some great build quality, nice audio reproduction and a really loud loudspeaker. And as with most Nokia smartphones, it's going to enjoy proper software support as well. Just wait until the stick it a with a price tag that matches better its feature set.</paragraph>
