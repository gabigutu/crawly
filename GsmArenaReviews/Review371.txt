			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W880 is the newest addition to the Sony Ericsson Walkman line. Nothing uncommon here, we've seen lots of those. The most unusual thing about it though is its form factor - an ultra slim bar-shaped handset with plenty of cool features to offer. Take 3G network support, add a 2 megapixel camera, spice it up with a M2 memory card slot and Bluetooth and finally put it all in the slimmest shell possible and you will get a great result - the Sony Ericsson W880.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The recent trend in mobile devices design is clear - make it as slim as it gets. Sony Ericsson long stood aside from the race for the slimmest mobile phone. Instead they preferred giving priority to their Walkman-branded music phones, cameraphones or both. But that was up until now. Now we are witnessing the incorporation of the famous portable music brand Walkman into one of the slimmest mobile handsets on the market. It comes as no surprise as rumors and leaked photos and info on the new handset have been flooding the Internet for quite some time now. And finally we got it - the Sony Ericsson W880 itself. And it's up to us to see how this slim baby performs on the treadmill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Size comparison with Nokia E70</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The announcement of the Sony Ericsson W880 was just today and we are more than proud to present you with an exclusive GSMArena review for your reading pleasure. Bear in mind that the test handset we got was a stable beta version and it is possible that there might be some minor differences in the final retail version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Sony Ericsson W880 will include 1GB Memory Stick Micro M2 card, a USB cable, and a stereo headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W880 will be available in two color variations - black and silver. The one we got to test was the black version. In fact black is the color of the front panel only - the entire back panel is styled in dark orange - the proprietary Walkman color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the regular Sony Ericsson W880 there will also be a version designated as Sony Ericsson W888. It will be manufactured for the Chinese market and will not include 3G connectivity and video telephony.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Back to basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W880 has a trendy design which manages to please the eye at the very first sight. The front panel is made of brushed aluminum which adds to fashionable looks and provides for a rather solid construction while at the same time the W880 is still lightweight and really slim. It measures 103 x 47 x 9.4 mm and weighs only 71 g. Unlike other slim mobile phones on the market it doesn't compensate for it's ultra slim body with larger body width or body length. The Motorola RAZR for example is rather wide; the Motorola KRZR is rather long, while the mobiles in the Samsung Ultra line are both too long and wide. The only other mobiles with a similar ultra slim form factor are Samsung P310, the LG KG320 and the LG KE820.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson W880</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The central place of the front panel of the Sony Ericsson W880 is taken by the 1.8" 262K colors TFT display with a QVGA resolution. Above it you can see the VGA camera for making video calls and the in-call speaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  VGA camera lens ? in-call speaker grill and etched Walkman logo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below it are the navigation keys which are grouped in three circular patterns. The central circle is the navigation D-pad itself. The left circle is composed of the left soft key, the web browser shortcut key and the Back key, while the right circle features the right soft key, the Activity menu key and the correction C key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W880 keypad ? Central circle ? Left and right keys</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric part of the keypad features great protruding orange keys which are really nice and comfortable to touch. The styling of the keypad is superb and it is rather comfortable to work with, but more on navigation and keypad is to come later on in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Alphanumeric keypad details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the W880 incorporates the shortcut key for starting the Walkman music player, the regular Fast port used for charging and for connecting the headset and the USB cable. Just below it still on the same left side one can see the cap of the Memory Stick Micro M2 memory card slot which offers true hot-swap functionality. The Fast port seems a little bit out of place here, and we would have liked it better if it had a cap on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W880 left side ? Walkman key ? Fast port ? Memory card slot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side on the other hand features the camera shortcut/shutter key and the tiniest slider control we have seen in a mobile phone. It serves as volume control and as zoom control while taking pictures and shooting video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   W880 right side ? Camera key ? Volume control</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the W880 body doesn't feature any keys at all. The On/Off key that usually is placed here and can be used for changing the active ringing profile doesn't exist here. Instead, you should use the correction C key to turn on or of the mobile phone. The situation with the bottom part of the device is pretty much the same - it doesn't feature any controls or special design elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Top and bottom part</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone over reveals its orange back panel. The back panel is made of plastic although it has a metallic paint finish which conceals the plastic base rather successfully. It's nice to touch but its color is too flashy for our tastes. There are two rubber anti-slip studs in the top corners which share the top part of the panel with the camera lens and the loudspeaker. The lower part of the W880 back panel features a strap hole for a neck strip. Unlike the ultra slim Samsung X820 the camera lens here doesn't protrude from the phone's body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Back panel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The central part of the back panel is taken by the battery cover which is easily removed. When removed, it reveals the standard Sony Ericsson BST-33 Li-Polymer battery with a capacity of 950 mAh. The same battery is used by Sony Ericsson W850 for example. According to the manufacturer, the battery should last up to 425 hours of standby mode and up to 6.5 hours of talk time when used in GSM-only network. The most exciting promise of the manufacturer though is that the battery would allow W880 to play music continuously for 18 hours straight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did spend a few days using the phone in the way a moderate user would, spending about 5 minutes in talking a day and using almost no other battery consuming feature and the fully charged battery kept the W880 running for good 3-4 days in 3G network which is a nice achievement for a slim phone like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Removing the battery panel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card bed is not the usual Sony Ericsson one. The slot is positioned in the bottom part of the battery housing and the SIM card is rather easy to get in or out - just the opposite of the situation with the rest of the Sony Ericsson mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The SIM card bed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are very pleased with the construction of the Sony Ericsson W880 - it's been a while since we saw a mobile handset with such a fresh design.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A unique keypad and an enhanced display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of the Sony Ericsson W880 is unique in its own way - the reason for that being that the manufacturer has no other model with a similar keypad. The keys are small and at first they seem really hard to use for a person with large fingers. However it turned out that they pose no problem at all. They provide a positive feedback and the keypad can easily be used at night without even looking at the keys. Thanks to their protruding design but soft response it's a real pleasure to type messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys backlighting has a white color, and although it is not quite even it does its job satisfactorily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The W880 keypad in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the display, our impression is that although it boasts a QVGA (320x240 pixels) resolution it has a far too small diagonal. We would have liked it better if the manufacturer had put a quarter of an inch more into it. Despite that we are quite pleased with the display and its performance under direct sunlight. Legibility under bright light conditions was not the best in previous Sony Ericsson models. They surely were legible but not anywhere close to the displays Nokia uses in their middle to higher range of mobile phones based on the Nokia S40 user interface. The display of the Sony Ericsson W880 seems a bit enhanced over those previous models and is perfectly on par with the Nokia displays.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A joyful call-maker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We did find the Sony Ericsson W880 an enjoyable mobile phone which did very well in all circumstances. The signal strength was at its best even in areas with not that good coverage while the sound during calls was loud and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to loudspeaker volume levels? Let's just say that the W880 is not among the loudest headsets we've seen recently. However you wouldn't have problems with hearing the alert of incoming calls. The medium loudness level is a bit strange, since a great example of a loud mobile phone - possibly one of the loudest we've tested, is in fact the closely related Sony Ericsson W850. The vibration strength of the W880 performs well but it's not among the strongest one either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Dialing a number ? Calling our friend Dexter</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You've seen it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in W880 is a standard non-smartphone Sony Ericsson user interface. This is the reason why we would use some excerpts from our previous reviews of Sony Ericsson phones. Of course, we would use the screenshots from W880 for illustration and the text would take into account all the interface specifics of this model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice thing is that the phone has a dedicated Flight mode, but unlike some other models, it can't be switched to or from without turning the phone off. Once you turn it off, the W880 can ask you whether you want to start it directly into Flight mode. A substantial difference, let say to Nokia flight mode, is that the phone cannot work in Flight mode unless there is a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Turning the phone on</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In active stand-by mode the screen displays information about the network signal, battery strength, current date and time, plus the next alarm that's due to go off. You can choose to display the clock with large semi-transparent numbers, which take up half the screen but blend with the chosen wallpaper very well. A good thing is that you can set the clock to be seen in the upper right angle of the screen even while browsing through the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Standby view: two types of clock</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the navigation pad in any of the four directions can start a given feature or application according to the user preference. In fact when you start using the phone for the first time, you are reminded of that option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Create shortcuts to the pad's four ways</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu itself is made of a matrix grid with 4 x 3 animated icons. All sub-menus are in listed view with tiny icons on the left side. The phone reacts and performs fast and smooth in every submenu and application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The main menu ? a listed sub menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several themes that come preinstalled in the phone. They change the color scheme, the wallpaper and the menu icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Main menu icons: two of the preinstalled themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a special Activity menu which has a dedicated shortcut key on the keypad. The Now running tab of the menu offers real multi-tasking. In W800 you could only run simultaneously one regular application and one Java application, for example. Now you can run three Java applications in the same time, which allows for a lot more freedom and flexibility in everyday usage. For example, you can open the browser, open an instant messenger client, listen to music and play a game, all at the same time. That's a great functionality that is not seen in other non-OS phones of other manufacturers. The rest of the functionality of the Activity menu has remained the same - it offers quick access to recent events, the web menu with integrated Google search and the My Shortcuts menu which contains a list of frequently used features and can be modified to the user preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    All four tabs of the Activity menu</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Contacts: A thousand of them<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface is simple and easy to use. As always, the phonebook asks you whether you would like to copy your contacts from the SIM card to the phone's memory. However you can choose if the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be the default for the phonebook. Both lists cannot be displayed simultaneously. Otherwise, a nice option is that you can make the phone to autosave to the SIM card any new contacts that you save in the phone's memory. You can also have the phone back up your phone numbers on the inserted memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Contacts list ? Phonebook options ? Choosing default contacts</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum capacity of the phonebook is 1000 contacts but you can save up to 2500 phone numbers. Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. Contacts are searched by gradual typing of the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Free memory status ? Sorting names</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, there are five possibilities for the phone number: Mobile, Home, Work, Fax and Other. This is the first tab of fields for the new contacts. The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture and a custom ringtone. The fourth goes for Title, Company, Street, City, State, ZIP, Country information. The last, fifth tab, is for additional information and birth date. When you add the birth date, the phone asks you whether you would like to add it to the calendar and put a reminder for it. That's a good feature and we like it that we see it available more and more often in current phones. While you browse your phonebook list, switching between different phone numbers and emails for a given contact is possible by pushing the side ways of the joystick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contact details</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls log is divided in four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. The tabs altogether contain up to 30 call records, which are shared between the separate tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Calls log</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All messages, except emails, use one Inbox. No matter what kind of message has been received, it goes to the common Inbox. Only email messages have their own separate Inbox. There is a My Friends feature, which works like an instant messaging application and can be used if your network operator supports it. The phone also offers a RSS feeds reader that in fact uses the NetFront web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messaging menu ? RSS feeds</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start typing a message, you must first choose from the three variants: Text message, Picture message, Voice message or Email. There is no point in that as you can easily transform a SMS into a MMS along the way by simply attaching multimedia objects to the message. The editor shows up to 5 lines en bloc. There is a character counter, which activates when you reach 20 characters before the 160 limit. When you pass the limit a "2 SMS" warning sign comes up for a second to alert you that the message will be divided in two parts. Of course, there is the T9 dictionary to assist the typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Write new ? typing a SMS ? insert options ? available symbols </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports POP3 and IMAP protocols. It can also manage several accounts simultaneously. You can choose between downloading only headers or headers and text. The phone can automatically check for new emails at a preset interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Email inbox ? reading your welcome email ? changing font size</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A serious Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W880 supports MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC+, WAV, WMA, M4A and MIDI file formats. The Walkman media player is version 2.0 and features improved interface. We have seen the 2.0 version already in our Sony Ericsson W850 review and we are more than pleased with it. It has several equalizer presets including the proprietary Mega Bass. The player can be set to run in background so you can do other things with the phone while listening to music. When in background mode, there is an indication of the name of the song and artist of the track currently playing in the top part of the screen. The control of the player is intuitive and really easy to use. It even displays the album cover during playback if there is one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    My Music menu ? Artists submenu ? Album submenu ? Album songs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are really pleased with the improved user interface. The sound is nice, too. The only negative side that the W880 has is the performance of the external loudspeaker when it comes to listening to music. It produces only the high and mid tones and there is not even a trace of the lower ones. What is more the sound is a bit hollow and metallic. But that is an inevitable consequence of the ultra slim shell which can only house a really small loudspeaker. Furthermore, there is a certain crack sound when playing music at the highest volume level. The Sony Ericsson W850 loudspeaker performs way better when it comes to loudness, and when it comes to great sound our all time favorite is the Sony Ericsson W950, but then again it doesn't play music as loud as W850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Playing a track</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of W880 is nice and offers the option to watch videos in landscape mode - in the original video size or in fullscreen mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Playing a video: portrait and landscape modes ? original and fit to screen modes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W880 also features the TrackID service which appears as a separate item in the Main Menu. The TrackID application records several seconds from the song you are listening to on let say your home stereo, connects to the Gracenote servers and should hopefully identify it for you. So if you happen to hear a great song on the radio you can always get the name and artist and even buy it directly online.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The well known file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have used other Sony Ericsson handsets you won't be surprised by the W880 file manager because there are no significant improvements here. On the other hand if you are still new to SE phones, well let me tell you that they have one of the best non-OS file managers. It allows you to mark files (single or multiple), copy them, move them, and also create and delete folders as you please. There are three tabs of file lists - one for the phone memory files, one for the memory stick files and one mutual for all files. By selecting a given tab you can filter the file list you wish to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The mutual tab ? available memory space</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing your pictures is as easy as ever - you could do that in a list view with or without thumbnails while the file names are visible. You can also choose to view your pictures as a grid matrix of thumbnails in 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 grids with no file names visible. The video files can also be browsed as thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    List view ? thumbnails list view ? 3 x 3 grid view* 2 x 2 grid view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the pictures themselves vertically (in portrait mode) just as you would on any other phone or horizontally (in landscape mode) if you prefer. When viewing the pictures one by one the phone preloads a lower quality preview in order to allow you fast browsing. Once you find a picture, you would like to see in its full glory you should stop browsing for a second and the phone would load it with its normal quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing the pictures in landscape mode is much more natural</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even more, up to 32x. Zooming is performed by small incrementing steps. That allows greater control but is kind of irritating since you have to go through several stages before you zoom in enough to check the details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Zooming in: 1x; 2x; 8x; 32x</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interesting thing about the file browser is the Timeline view, which allows you to filter the pictures according to the month they have been taken in. After you specify the month, you could even choose the exact date. That sort of image filtering is offered by computer picture browsers and digital cameras. The Timeline sorting is seen more and more often lately in the recent Sony Ericsson phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing options ? applying a monthly filter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While browsing pictures you can easily do a little bit of editing on them or send them as MMS and email or via Bluetooth. You can even upload the selected image to an online blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Available options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to edit some of the pictures you have taken, the PhotoDJ application is at your disposal. With its help you can easily adjust levels, light balance, brightness and contrast, remove unwanted red-eye effect, apply some color effects to the picture such as negative and sepia, or you can add a frame or a text to the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    PhotoDJ image editing application</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A regular Sony Ericsson cam<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2 megapixel camera of W880 does its job satisfactory without any bells and whistles. The quality of the pictures taken is rather the same as the quality of the pictures taken by Sony Ericsson W850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Taking a picture</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen better quality cameras from Sony Ericsson, not to mention the lack of autofocus. The camera offers night mode, self-timer, panorama, frames, and burst shooting modes. It also features white balance correction. Several color effects are available, too. The menu interface has gone through some minor graphics updates and now the menu looks a bit 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Some camera menu options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shooting is performed in landscape mode by using the camera shortcut button as a shutter key. Of course, you can take a picture in portrait mode too, but the camera menu is meant to be used in landscape mode. Once you've taken a picture with the phone you can immediately blog it on the Internet and thus share it with your friends. The camera options are in a menu that we have seen on all recent phones by Sony Ericsson so if you've had one, you would feel perfectly at home here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are very pleased with the performance of the camera - taking pictures doesn't take long even at the highest resolution and quality settings. The shot-to-shot times are great which is usual for the recent Sony Ericsson mobiles. Sony Ericsson W880 has no dedicated macro mode, everything closer than say 80 cm from the lens will be out of focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>                Sample pictures taken with Sony Ericsson W880</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with W880 are captured at a low QCIF resolution. You can choose to limit the video duration in order to fit it on a MMS message or you can make unlimited recordings. The options for the video camera are pretty much the same as those for the still camera with very minor differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W880 sample video</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should also mention the video calls camera on the front of W880 since after all we are reviewing a 3G phone here that is capable of making video calls. We are pleasantly surprised by the functionality that this tiny VGA camera offers. The other party's video feed is viewed in a large frame in the middle of the screen while you see your own image in the very same time in a small frame in the lower left corner. There is also a possibility to view your own image mirror-like, meaning that the image gets reversed and looks as if you are staring at yourself in a mirror. It's much more natural that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also digitally zoom your image at a 2x degree or choose to replace your live video feed with a picture of your taste or with a live feed from the main camera. You can also do that during an actual video call. The options don't end here. You can further on control the exposure compensation of the camera or even switch it into a night mode. There are 3 different video quality modes: Smooth, Sharp and Normal. Smooth delivers a smoother picture flow while Sharp provides more detailed images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Regular setup ? replacing the two pictures</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing can be fun<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides 3G and GPRS for fast data transfers, video calls and streaming content support, the handset offers the usual connectivity capabilities such as the USB support and Bluetooth. The handset supports OMA DRM 2.0, which makes it compatible with almost all online music shops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we tested, the integrated HTML Access NetFront Internet browser is at a good level and it does its job more than all right. It has a lot of options - you can view the pages fullscreen with no menus showing and you can even browse your Web pages in landscape mode. It has WAP and picture modes. It supports content created for HTML 4.01, xHTML 1.0, CSS and Java script, WAP 2.0. The supported security protocols are SSL/TLS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Smart-fit function of the browser manages well with fitting the web content into the screen. Scrolling is fast once the page has loaded completely. Our impression is that the Smart-fit function has got an upgrade and does its job better than on previous Sony Ericsson models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Browsing GSMArena.com with Smart-Fit ? Portrait mode ? Landscape mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's try browsing the same way without the Smart-Fit function switched off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Browsing GSMArena.com with Smart-Fit off</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An added nice feature is that the browser supports zooming in and out of the Web pages of up to 200%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Zooming out on 50% ? Zooming in on 200%</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset supports Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP profile, which means that you could use a stereo Bluetooth headset with it and that is something you don't see in every phone nowadays. Another notable thing about the excellent Bluetooth support is the Human Interface Device (HID) profile which allows the phone to be used as a remote control for PC and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Further on, the phone could be used as a Bluetooth modem for Internet access on a PC or a mobile computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The integrated "Remote" application</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has support for local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC while the remote synchronization is with remote servers. The USB connectivity of the phone has two modes - one for file transfers and one for USB Internet - to put it simply, the second one is for using the phone as a modem. A great feature that we see in every new Sony Ericsson phone nowadays is the capability to update the firmware version of the phone over-the-air, meaning you can download the new version through the phone itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>And it doesn't end there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This phone offers many time organizing features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Alarms, Calculator, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Applications and Code memo. The Calendar offers monthly and weekly view. As we have mentioned above, when you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone asks you if you wish to add it in the calendar too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Organizer menu ? Calendar monthly view ? Calendar weekly view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Reminders can be put as Subjects. Notes are written as messages; there even is the T9 to assist writing. There are five alarms available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat it on chosen days of the week or everyday. Furthermore, you can add text and a picture to the alarm as well as set its behavior in case the time that the alarm is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Alarms menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder doesn't have any limit in the duration of the recordings since all the free memory is available for the purposes of the application. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one, which you have probably already seen. It offers the basic functions with no bells and whistles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Voice recorder ? Calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the additional applications are concerned, the only one available is the World Time. It is Java based and has a nice 3D graphics for finding the needed time zone on a rotating world globe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   World Time</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include the MusicDJ, VideoDJ and the Music Mate. VideoDJ is for making video clips from scratch or for editing existing recording using special transition effects and by adding background music. It can be a very amusing application. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    VideoDJ application: adding text and music ? MusicDJ application</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gaming is on the safe side<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our test W880 had only one game preinstalled - the well-known QuadraPop. It is a Tetris-like game, which can be rather amusing if you are in the right mood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  QuadraPop</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W880 is a great addition to the Sony Ericsson lineup. Furthermore it is a really intriguing addition to the group of the slimmest champion mobile phones in the market. Since most of those doesn't feature 3G support, the W880 will most surely find its market niche and would gain strong popularity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are impressed with the usability of the device, the nice technical specifications, the great music player and the decent battery life. All in all, a great move from Sony Ericsson that would win them a lot of fans. Well, as it seems, the Sony Ericsson W880 was surely worth the commotion and all that months of waiting.</paragraph>
