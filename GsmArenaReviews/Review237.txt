			<paragraph>At a London live, Nokia presented the long-awaited E-series newcomers - Nokia E66 and Nokia E71. The two handsets are Nokia craftsmanship at its highest and high-tech goodies galore: auto focus cameras, Wi-Fi, GPS and the power of the latest Symbian S60 UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E71 packs a full hardware QWERTY keypad and its design feels somewhat Blackberry-esque although it's actually a successor of the Nokia E61i. Nokia E71 brings much more style to the E-series with a girth of mere 10mm. It's impressively compact for its form factor but that in turn has shrinked the display to 2.36 inches (as opposed to the impressive 2.8" screen of E61i).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardwarewise, the E71 offers the latest in smartphone with a built-in GPS receiver, which works with Nokia Maps, 3 megapixel auto focus camera and - of course - HSDPA and Wi-Fi. There is also the microSD card slot to expand the available 110MB memory with up to 8GB worth of additional storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E66 is the same business-grade device as the Nokia E71, without the QWERTY keyboard. It's more compact but screen real estate is not sacrificed at all - the Nokia E66 has a 2.4" QVGA TFT display. Since it also sports a built-in accelerometer, you can also enjoy screen auto rotation, as well as silencing of incoming calls when the device is facing down. Other than that, the specs remain identical, making it an equaly sweet gadget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices also feature an Infrared port (no fooling), as well as a microUSB port and Bluetooth (A2DP and EDR).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email is the highlight in both devices, as they support a wide range of personal and corporate email standards such as Microsoft Exchange, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail, Nokia Intellisync Wireless Email solution, along with System Seven and Visto Mobile. Encryption is also on board, as well as mobile VPN support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E71 and Nokia E66 also come with a new switch mode (in the profiles menu) for switching between personal and work home screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clad in stainless steel and etched graphics (E51-style), the new handsets will be available in grey steel or white steel colors. Both Nokia E71 and Nokia E66 are expected to begin shipping in July and are expected to retail at 350 euro before taxes and subsidies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If that's enough to get you started, hit the jump for real life photos and our first impressions.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The E71 is a remarkably compact phone given it's feature load and form factor. Standing at 10mm thickness, the Nokia E71 is actually the thinnest QWERTY handset. Nokia didn't miss the opportunity to stress that at the unveiling event in London.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you dig deeper and do some comparing, you'll find out that it's the slimmest smartphone ever - regardless of the operating system. What's more, it's the thinnest phone to feature Wi-Fi or a built-in GPS receiver. On top of that, Nokia E71 is powered by a good 1500 mAh battery - now, that's an engineering feat from a company that's never been keen on ultra thin handsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E71 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>But the small size has brought its own drawbacks along - the QWERTY keyboard is small and it can be hard for people with larger fingers to thumb their way across the alphabet. Then, there's the screen - the 2.8" diagonal of the original Nokia E61i looked really impressive back in its day. The Nokia E71 display has shrunk to 2.36", but is still technically what we here call a large display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E71 seems to be using a rather capable processor (369MHz) with very rare interface hiccups only evident in some multimedia applications. But there are also additional resources to help things further - the E71 has got 128MB of RAM (71MB of which are user available). That's triple the amount of available RAM, as compared to the Nokia E61i. So you are basically looking at one fast, lean machine here that will handle all your multi-tasking needs with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The E71 traditionally has an exceptional Nokia display - a trans-reflective unit that deals perfectly with direct sunlight. On a different note, all but the display and keypad is shiny metal all over. That does the beauty trick but leaves a lot to be desired when fingerprints come into play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QVGA screen resolution is a standard one and it's enough - all details and colors look nice and crisp. Plus you get compatibility with almost all existing applications. A larger resolution would have also meant a performance hit, so QVGA is really ok. The landscape orientation of the display also comes in handy when browsing images or web sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In practice, the QWERTY keyboard seems nice overall - keys have excellent tactile feedback and usability hasn't been hurt by the limited size. It's only some key combos that would make you wish you had a good old desktop-sized typewriter at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the D-pad, there are three predefined shortcuts and - typical E-series - they all mean business. The keys lead straight to Calendar, Contacts and Email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of user interface, Nokia E71 runs on the now standard Symbian S60 UI with Feature Pack 1. Feature Pack 2 is actually the latest upgrade of the user interface and it was introduced on all Symbian devices that were announced back in February. So we just can't understand why the downgrade, anyone?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyways, Nokia have added some new features, which are not present in other similar devices. First of all, it's the ultra easy email setup. If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your email address and password to start enjoying emailing-on-the-go. Nokia E71 takes care of downloading all the relevant settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, there's a special Mode Switcher, which practically toggles between two homescreen setups - one for work and one for leisure for example. The Calendar application has also received a face lift - now it offers a much streamlined view of what's on and what's ahead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the improved web browser, which by the way is the market leader anyway. It has received full Flash support (Flash Lite 3), as well as seamless secure Intranet support via the mobile VPN client that's also set up on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's a new feature, you might know as Remote Wipe. It's not a new feature per se, but up until now it was usually reserved for corporate scenarios. Now it's available to everyone. In case your Nokia E71 gets stolen or lost, you should simply send a coded SMS message. It gets locked down and after three unsuccessful attempts of unlocking it, it wipes itself clean of all personal or sensitive info. You might not get your Nokia E71 back, but at least nobody will get your personal data either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So that's about it - we've had a really short rendezvous with the Nokia E71 but we hope to see more of it at the office in the near future. For the time being, enjoy the live photos and hit the next bumpy jumpy for our scoop of Nokia E66.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Nokia E66 builds on the successful Nokia E65. The E66 is functionally identical to Nokia E71, which we covered in more detail. It's powered by the same 369MHz processor and has the same amount of RAM: 128MB, of which 71MB are available to the user. So again, the E66 is one nippy smartphone, which handles admirably.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E66 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E66 comes in a different form factor as compared to the E71, but retains all the signature fineries of the E-series. The excellent design, metallic body and rich feature load make it a sound alternative of the E71 and still those two won't be running against each other - they are simply targeted at consumer groups with different needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E66 has only one feature over the Nokia E71 and that's the built-in accelerometer. It's actually not that much of an advantage - it's more like compensation for the fact that the E66 portrait oriented display is not as good as the E71 one in web browsing, image browsing or reading Office documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accelerometer is used for automatic change of the screen orientation as well as silencing an incoming call by simply turning it face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Softwarewise, the Nokia E66 has the same advantages and drawbacks as the E71 - it's limited to the S60 Feature Pack 1 for some unknown reason but features a number of innovations such as the easy email setup, the Mode Switcher, the enhanced Calendar and the improved web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we wrap it up with the latest Nokia offerings - the E71 and E66. A welcome break from the N-series looks, those two devices seem to inspire with quality finish and excellent materials and, most of all, eye-pleasing design. We are looking forward to some quality time with them in the comfort of our office.</paragraph>
