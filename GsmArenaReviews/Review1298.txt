			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A brand new OS, more speed, a facelift and a high-res touchscreen, the latest of the Bold messengers is listening for the roar of the crowd. There's no going back to the old rational and composed self - give it danger, thrills and excitement. The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is stronger, faster, better. No ordinary messenger, it's the bearer of good news.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although on a second thought, a snappy 1.2GHz processor, the new BlackBerry OS 7.0 with Liquid graphics and a super crisp VGA touchscreen are no good news for the competition. Nor is HD video, dual-band Wi-Fi and NFC support. And all that comes on top of the standard BlackBerry package. The solid build quality and corporate grade email and data security go without saying. The sharp precision of the trackpad and a responsive capacitive touchscreen balance each other in a device that's convincingly comfortable to handle. Add a standard-setting QWERTY keyboard, and you have a phone which puts you in charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, the Bold Touch 9900 is bigger than the preceding 9700 Bold series. It's actually more of a return to the BlackBerry 9000 styling, with a larger screen and body. And since this is a touch phone we're talking about, the increased display real estate is welcome. Especially considering that the main competition recently had a major boost in resolution. With BlackBerry and Eseries now on par at VGA, the Bold Touch 9900 gets ahead of the Nokia E6 with 2.8" against 2.44" of screen diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So much for size. We're eager to see about speed and performance too. RIM did get creative with the finish too this time, but did they cross any kind of line? Our traditional hardware checkup is coming up. Has the Bold Touch 9900 got what it takes to do well? Follow us on the next page as we unbox and inspect the design, display and controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Rich retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 has everything in the box to get you going. To get the basics out of the way, a charger, headset and a microUSB cable are all provided. But there's more: a leather pouch, cleaning cloth as well as Europe continental and UK plug adapters.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is wider than its predecessor, the Bold 9780, as it has to accommodate a bigger display and battery. At 115 x 66 x 10.5 mm, it looks sharp and slim. The weight of 130g is more than reasonable - a mere 8g more than the Bold 9780.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The added touchscreen is a major novelty on the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900. But the looks may fool you. It's a typical RIM messenger, conservative elegance and quality in a traditionally understated, professional design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front looks almost equally split between the 2.8" touchscreen and the keys (navigation controls and the QWERTY keyboard). The back was a surprise, something we weren't prepared for in a BlackBerry. The smooth edges are cut in comfortable holding shape and the soft rubbery finish gives good grip. It's the actual battery cover that splits our team's opinions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fiberglass plate did look a bit out of touch with a supposedly conservative, professional styling. Having the handset around for a good few days helped - it's obviously an acquired taste. But there are still members of our team who find it a lot more questionable than leather. It's an unusual combination. Some will appreciate the bold styling, while others might find it inconsistent with the business messenger image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don?t have as many doubts about the brushed metal frame running along the sides of the handset. It can be traced all the way back to the Bold 9000, but looks a lot better on a slim phone like the Bold Touch 9900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 has the looks to match that newly acquired skill, though obviously some will prefer the old Bold styling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent keyboard and display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To cast all doubt aside, the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 gives us another great display. It's a 2.8" TFT capacitive touchscreen of VGA resolution. Crisp image at 286ppi and good sensitivity, the lack of haptic feedback is the only thing to complain about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is excellent, to solidify the good impression recent BlackBerry smartphones have made. Viewing angles are about average - there's some contrast loss and color shifting when you look at it from extreme angles, but everything remains legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also did our traditional brightness test. Here is how the BlackBerry Bold Touch scores alongside other devices. You can learn more about the test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, to the next most important thing here - the QWERTY keyboard of the Bold Touch 9900 is very comfortable. The keys, it seems to us, are just the right bit softer than on previous Bold editions. This gives you speed without compromising the press feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are small but ergonomic and carefully sculpted for great tactility and usability - only users with very large hands may have trouble adapting. The only thing to warn against is one of the metal ridges dividing the rows of keys. The second one from the top does not fit firmly in place and bends when pushed. Nothing to stand in the way of comfortable typing but it raises concerns about the overall durability of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many of the keys (not just the numbers) can be assigned speed dial. There is a dedicated currency symbol key and the usual command shortcuts: * locks the keypad and screen, while # toggles Silent mode on/off. Numbers share keys with some of the letters and you need to press the alt key to use them at times. The good thing is that whenever the context allows it, the switch is automatic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The rest of the controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are four controls around a centrally placed trackpad: the typical BlackBerry combo of Call keys, with Menu and Back buttons. Although you now have a touchscreen at your disposal, the trackpad will be quite busy, giving you the needed accuracy in the browser or when handling text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Large size and solid press, the call and navigation buttons are no trouble to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top, we find the traditional status LED, proximity sensor and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset is in charge of connectivity, with a 3.5mm audio jack and the standard microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 features the volume controls and the single convenience key, set by default to serve the camera. It won?t be long though, we think, before you give it a different job. Portrait is the default orientation for taking pictures with the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900, and a shutter key placed low on the side makes no sense. It?s a fixed focus camera too, no half press button needed, so the trackpad and even the keyboard's enter key do just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dedicated pause/mute button is placed between the volume Up and Down keys. The Bold Touch 9900 doesn?t have the trademark invisible keys on top. The top-placed Lock button is well visible this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features no controls or ports. The mouthpiece is right inside the keyboard at the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 5 megapixel camera lens and a LED flash are the main attraction at the back. Below the battery cover is the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1230 mAh Li-Po battery is quoted at up to 307 hours of stand-by or 6 hours and 30 minutes of talk time. In real life, the battery lasted about two days of heavy usage. We were constantly connected to Wi-Fi and the 3G network, shooting the usual amount of stills and videos. There was quite a bit of video and music playback and web browsing too, with about 30 minutes of talks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is the usual solid and credible business handset. Wider and rounder, it doesn?t look as sharp as the previous 97xx generation. There?s a touchscreen in it though and every fraction of an inch counts. The display is bigger at 2.8? and crisper at VGA resolution. All in a slimmer package, so no complaints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re not quite convinced by the fiberglass battery cover but there?s no right and wrong in matters of taste. From an ergonomic point of view, there?s little to criticize. Let?s just say the Convenience key will live up to its name if you don?t use it as a shutter key. The great keyboard is no surprise, the touchscreen looks good and feels right, and nothing beats a trackpad at accuracy-requiring tasks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 7 - trackpad vs. touchscreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Number 7 is the last upgrade of the OS before the switch to QNX. The OS 7 brings very few new features (NFC and HD video are well worth a mention though) and focus should be on the user experience instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new platform is based on a 1.2 GHz processor and more potent graphics hardware, and it?s exactly the higher system requirements that won?t allow older BlackBerry phones to run the new OS 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes our traditional video demo to warm you up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 7 is trying to look like the QNX-based Tablet OS. The UI icons have been updated to mimic the PlayBook, but the rest is pretty much the same - functionality changes are kept to a minimum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status area of the homescreen has virtual buttons in a row, allowing you to quickly toggle the cellular, Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth radios. It gives you quick access too to the alarm clock and settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clicking on the loudspeaker icon underneath lets you change the currently active profile, while the magnifying glass on the other side of the homescreen lets you start a search. BlackBerry OS 7 is voice search enabled, too. Tapping on a small mic icon next to the Search bar will activate it. By the way, on the homescreen you can initiate a search by just typing something on your keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed events - SMS, email or missed calls - can be quickly accessed by pressing the bar between the search and profile icons on the default screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below that is the app tray, which consists of several tabs. You can easily hide that completely or lift up one, two or three rows of it with a swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first of the app launcher tabs holds all icons. For convenience, you can sort some of your apps to the Favorite tab. The most frequently used apps are auto generated in yet another tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also Media and Download (for the apps you have downloaded yourself) sections for even more ways of sorting your apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, there is a trackpad and there is a touchscreen. The trackpad is the usual sharp and precise navigation option. But with lots of clickable elements on the screen you need to scroll through all to reach the one you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pretty much everything you see is clickable in BlackBerry OS 7 and works the way it's supposed to. Sure, there are still small elements such as the homescreen Search and Profiles icons, which are easier to access via the trackpad rather than the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing to note is that, unlike the flat iOS layout, the Bold 9900 has a menu button, so usually there are options that are not visible on the screen. You get used to that pretty quickly though so in the end, the Bold Touch 9900 manages to keep both new and returning users happy. Trackpad and touchscreen complete each other in a natural way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has no changes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 may run a new edition of the OS, but its phonebook is the same as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically by first, last name or company and you can pick which of their recent activities to get displayed when checking out their details. Smart search lets you find a specific contact by typing a part of the name, so navigation is pretty fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like previous BlackBerry devices, the Bold Touch 9900 lets you put your contacts in one of two categories - personal and business and then filter your phonebook accordingly. There is also grouping available and you can create as many custom groups as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In edit mode, the available contact details are neatly organized. You can replicate some of the fields and add custom ones easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has both voice and smart dial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In calls, the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is the usual solid performer. No voice quality drops or reception issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What gives the Bold Touch 9900 some extra points however is the Smart dial feature. Indeed that was our preferred way of locating contacts on the handset - you just press a few keys straight on the homescreen and a list of suggested names is promptly returned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can then select them with the trackpad or tap directly on the contact to initiate a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Dial is also available via the Universal Voice Search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 scored a Very Good mark in our traditional loudspeaker test, so you should have no concerns about missed calls and messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is all fine, but email needs BIS subscription<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 handles has all kinds of messages. You get SMS, MMS and email support out of the box and there are also a few IM apps preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, a BIS account is a must if you are to use email on the Bold 9900. And while we understand the advantages of the BlackBerry internet service, it would have been nice to give users some kind of choice. You know ? you can go for the security we offer or you can use whatever internet plan you have and live without it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we shouldn?t forget that not every carrier worldwide is offering BIS, which reduces the Bold 9900 reach. Still if you do get a subscription you can check out the nicely organized and easily customizable client, which has deservedly earned its name over the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be resized for sending, emails can be flagged and filtered by request, color and status, while folders can be created, edited and deleted on the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editors, which look identical for all types of messages, are pretty simple to use and with a neat interface. There is a counter at the top indicating the remaining characters to 160, and another one showing the number of parts the message will break down into for sending. That one turns into a data counter if you are creating an MMS or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering recipients is as quick and convenient as it gets. You just start typing and smart-dial kicks in, giving you a list of suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Complete with a convenient QWERTY keyboard, the Bold Touch 9900 is great at its main job ? texting. Some visual improvements would've been welcome, but getting the job done is what really matters here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Same ol' music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>RIM have surely refreshed the Music Player icons, but that?s basically all they did. The styling is still pretty conservative, but most of the functionality has been there since BlackBerry OS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s quick search of tracks and automatic sorting by artist, album and genre. Custom playlists are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is on the list of included features too, along with equalizer presets and the single track repeat option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or the main menu. Pausing it by hitting the mute button is also possible, what's missing is an indication of the currently playing song on the home screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With so many better options out there, the Bold Touch 9900 is an easy one to overlook if video-watching is a priority. It would be a mistake. The Bold Touch 9900 does a really great job, so you might want to tick that box on your wish list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape screen is a good start, while the video player itself isn?t bad either. Its styling might not be too impressive, but the functionality is mostly there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are the usual playback controls when you hit a key or tap on the screen, along with a dedicated fit/zoom to screen button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bold Touch 9900 video player is said to support DivX, XviD, H.264/MPEG-4 and WMV videos up to 720p resolution. It did manage to play all of the DivX files we threw at it, WMV, MOV and MP4 files up to 720p were no problem either, but the XviD videos didn?t go that easy. Some of the files were OK, while others where just incompatible. It seems it's a bit rate or audio thing, but we won't count on that XviD support much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance here is decent, which is probably more than most BlackBerry customers will ever need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Average audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We put our BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 unit through our traditional audio quality test, but it didn't quite manage to pass it with flying colors. Not that we expected anything knowing its pedigree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to the line-out (i.e. the active external amplifier) the Bold Touch 9900 has decent signal-to-noise ratio, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk. The distortion levels are decent and the volume levels are excellent. However, the frequency response is far from optimal with the extreme bass frequencies completely cut-off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones are connected, the Bold Touch 9900 stereo crosstalk increases dramatically and volume levels drop quite a lot. At least the distortion levels increase quite slightly, which promotes them from average to good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple, yet powerful gallery inherited from OS 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery hasn't changed since the OS 6, so it should be familiar to all BlackBerry users already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be browsed in grid mode or viewed as a standard list. There?s search by name here too, but we?re not the type that remembers the names of our image files, so we won?t count that as an extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can only be browsed in landscape mode or you can manually rotate them. Unfortunately the Bold Touch 9900 has no built-in accelerometer to provide automatic rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can skip to the next photo without returning to the gallery ? you just flick your finger over the trackpad or do a finger swipe on the screen and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Checking an image?s properties, applying zoom, as well as starting a slide show, are all a menu key click away. Setting one of your images as a homescreen wallpaper is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture browsing is pretty fast and so are zooming and panning. It would have been nice to use the volume rocker as a zoom lever, but the gallery is generally pretty good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A fixed-focus 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 comes with a 5 megapixel camera which is, still the highest resolution you can get from a RIM smartphone. To make it worse, it's a fixed-focus unit so close-range shots (like say documents) are hardly its element.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera comes with the same unattractive interface and relatively low number of customizable settings. What?s even worse is that the bar at the bottom covers a part of the frame, making proper framing a really hard task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key is also pretty uncomfortable, considering that you do most of your shooting with the Bold Touch 9900 in portrait mode. Still you can always use the trackpad or the dedicated virtual key on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geotagging, flash and scenes can be accessed straight in the viewfinder and those are just about the only options you get with the Bold Touch 9900. The only other thing you can customize is image resolution, which is located in the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no settings for exposure compensation, white balance, ISO or anything like that. There is face detection, but that is a dedicated scene, rather than a separate setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is about average (still an achievement, given the RIM history) - there is a good amount of resolved detail and colors are pleasing. Contrast is fine, too, but the noise levels are way above average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go several samples so you can judge the image quality yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. You can see the Bold 9900 is a decent performer but is no match for top cameraphones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is among the first RIM smartphones to come with HD video recording - an achievement it shares with two of the Torches - the 9860 and the 9810. It is capable of shooting 1280x720 videos at 30 fps and can use the LED as video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is pretty high ? the frame rate is good, the resolved detail is adequate, the noise levels tolerable, the colors accurate and the contrast is fine too. Our main grudge is the higher compression levels applied in the processing, but that's to be expected from 3GP videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a 720p video sample from the Bold Touch 9900 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is another we've uploaded to YouTube for your convenience.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is giving you a broad range of connectivity options, as you would expect in a modern day smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming and the quad-band 3G with 14.4Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA gives you the extra speed. The dual-band Wi-Fi is another nice addition with an easily customizable Wi-Fi manager taking care of all the connections. Wi-Fi hotspot is also available. Bluetooth with A2DP support rounds off the list of wireless connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is also equipped with a standard microUSB port that is enabled for both data connections and charging. Once connected, you can sync your data with the BlackBerry Desktop Software. It allows you to sync your iTunes collection, save for the files that have DRM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bold Touch is NFC capable too. You can pair it with other NFC-enabled devices and NFC accessories as well as read NFC tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you have the option to use your microSD memory card slot for file transfers.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good browser, but no Flash support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is one of the best we have seen lately. Despite the smallish display, the browser still does an excellent job and will serve you well. It is fast, responsive, supports multi-touch zooming, text selection, text reflow, mouse cursor, etc. The only thing missing is Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you decide to use the trackpad instead of the touchscreen, you'll get a virtual mouse cursor and automatic panning and scrolling when you reach the end of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple tabs are supported and switching between them is pretty easy - just tap on the tabs key at the top right corner. Page rendering is near perfect, displaying almost every page like on a desktop browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text reflow works like a charm, responding promptly to your double taps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the missing Flash support, the handset provides probably one of the best user experience in browsing the web despite its smallish display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its business ethic, the Bold Touch 9900 has superb time-management capabilities. Its organizer includes a decent set of applications and although some of them are hardly lookers, their usability cannot be called into question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and lets you easily set up customized events. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful but sadly the device fails to provide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with the full version of Quick Office pre-installed allowing it to view all kind of documents (incl. PDF) and edit Word, Excel or Power Point files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter, as well as a voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application has only one alarm slot and fails to impress. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be adjusted from the settings menu. There you can change the alarm tone, snooze time and the volume as well as the vibration intensity. Given the single slot limitation though, getting an alternative alarm clock app from the BlackBerry App World seems like the right thing to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 comes with a stopwatch and a timer. Both are accessed from the clock application and have the standard functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock also offers a bedside mode that turns off the status LED (unless you set it otherwise) and displays a large clock on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a Password Keeper app, Voice Recorder, Memos and Tasks app to store your passwords, voice memos, text memos and tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 comes with Facebook and Twitter applications. You also get the native Social Feeds app that gathers all of your Facebook and Twitter updates in one place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry App World<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry App World is the RIM application distribution solution. Quite well organized, it accepts payment by credit card or Paypal. Some you can get for free of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manage your apps on a computer or directly on the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a basic filtering system as well - it allows you to check out the highest rated free and paid applications, as well as the newest releases. In general there's hardly anything to complain about in terms of interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of applications isn?t as impressive as in the App Store or the Android Market at just over 14500 apps, 3500 games and 12000 themes, and to make it worse only a small fraction of the titles are actually free (though some of the paid apps offer free trials).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Maps also requires a BIS plan<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As one would expect nowadays, the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver and comes with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps preinstalled. Unfortunately it is yet another application that only works with a BlackBerry internet plan activated. And the only navigation option you get is directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get directions you can enter an address straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps also allows you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS, and that rounds off a decent but certainly not spectacular application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, addresses that are included in messages are automatically detected and can be displayed on the map at the expense of a few clicks. The map data has also been updated to include more cities. We can still think of at least several apps with more detailed maps, but let's not get too picky here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>More screen resolution and power than BlackBerry owners know what to do with? Certainly not. It?s more than they?re used to though and that makes the Bold Touch 9900 a very attractive upgrade option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More touchscreen than the typical business user needs? Negative. Touchscreen and QWERTY work together, not against each other, in the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And just to be clear ? we?re not questioning the latest of the Bolds. We?re not playing down its role and potential. We?re simply looking for things that can threaten its relationship with the core user base. Frankly, we can?t find any.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 is not without flaws and RIM are not in denial about the catching up they need to do. What makes it particularly hard is a conservative target audience that they need to be careful not to alienate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1.2GHz processor and more RAM are not just there for the record. The Canadians weren't after a speed boost for its own sake, nor with advanced multimedia or gaming in mind. The goal was uncompromised experience that business users believe they?re entitled to. The HD video recording is a byproduct, one that will be more relevant in the Torch lineup. NFC, on the other hand, more than makes sense in a business phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, touchscreen has been stretching the definition of strictly business phones. It?s inevitable and there?s no better proof than an old arch-rival. Despite having a rather rough ride into touchscreen, Nokia knew they couldn?t afford to leave the Eseries behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We met the Nokia E6 in its Symbian Anna phase and things looked good. A great screen, though a bit smaller, paired with another excellent keyboard. The E6 boasts a better camera and Flash support, and comes reasonably cheaper. It is soon to get the Symbian Belle upgrade and that will make it even better. There?s probably nothing to do about NFC though.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Europe-bound Motorola Pro might want to have a say too, but it?s just taking too long. Wide-ranging email support and advanced security features make it a solid alternative and it?s got an even bigger touchscreen in its favor. Although it was originally meant to launch on Froyo, it would be nice of Motorola to do something about Gingerbread.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy M Pro B7800 is another expected release. With a 1GHz processor and the latest Android, it doesn?t seem underpowered at all. There?s even an optical trackpad to mimic the actual BlackBerry experience.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Android alternatives don?t end there. The Sony Ericsson Xperia Pro and the HTC Desire Z will do too if you don?t mind a year-old package. And how about the HTC ChaCha? No, you?re right. We?re pushing it a bit too far.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>BlackBerries are for users who know what they want in a business phone. And the good thing is RIM is giving them greater choice. If a bigger screen is a must and you don?t want to sacrifice the hardware keyboard, the Torch 9810 is your kind of phone. It is basically a Bold Touch repackaged as a slider with a bigger 3.2? screen. The price tag is almost the same too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>And by the way, for a certain set of users nothing actually beats a BlackBerry except another BlackBerry. RIM know it perfectly well though that complacency is one thing they cannot afford. They?re keen on giving users a choice, building their lineups, leveling out the class divisions and abandoning the strict hierarchy in their portfolio. Bold has always been the royal bloodline. It?s just that it?s now living in a democracy. But the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900 still makes a fine flagship.</paragraph>
