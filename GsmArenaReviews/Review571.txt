			<paragraph>How about this for a rebound after a rather quiet second half of last year? A massive change of game plan sees HTC focus on a few special products instead of trying to create a smartphone for every taste. An outstanding result of this effort, the HTC One X brings so many firsts for both company and industry, that a climb to the top of the food chain may be a walk in the park.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just look at some of the things the One X has put on its resume. The 4-PLUS-1 Tegra 3 makes its smartphone debut here, the awesome polycarbonate body adds that extra solid feel and grip, while the 4.7" second-generation S-LCD of HD resolution on the front is a crystal-clear view to the world of Sense 4.0 and Android 4.0 ICS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's just the HTC One X getting started, check out the complete list below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Previous HTC flagships were often criticized for lacking identity and bringing little improvement in terms of both features and design. This time critics should have little to fret about - the One X is as bold a step forward as it gets. Not only is the processing power more than doubled, but the screen and body of the smartphone itself are immensely better than what the Sensation and Sensation XE had to offer. And let's not forget the camera, which HTC say is the best they have ever made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we're particularly impressed with about the One X is that it's actually more compact than you'd expect from a phone with a 4.7" screen. Not only is it impressively slim, the One X is only marginally larger than the omnipresent Samsung Galaxy S II and that one had a 4.3" screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>There's not much going on inside the eco-friendly box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Starting with the One X, HTC are moving away from the plain paper packaging of its older smartphones in favor of a new kind of foam box with rounded edges, that's wrapped in a paper sleeve made of 100% recyclable and biodegradable materials. The labels were reportedly printed with environmentally friendly soy ink, so the company is obviously trying hard to show that it cares.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the contents of the box are not even nearly as special as its shape and finish. There's a pair of cheapish-looking headphones inside, and the usual charger/data-cable combo. Given the One X has no microSD slot, we couldn't have expected a memory card inside, but there are no Beats headphones either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The supplied headset is pretty basic and it turns out the Beats audio logo on the back of the One X here only stands for the software tweaks, which the smartphone got. The final item in the box is the pin required for extracting the microSIM tray. By the looks of it, the One X's retail package is a step backwards from the one of the Sensation XE.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC One X 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The brilliant use of space is one of the best things about the HTC One X. It's not that the smartphone is tiny, you'd hardly call it a compact set. But at 134.4 x 69.9 x 8.9 mm it's merely 3.8mm wider and less than a cm longer than the Galaxy S II, which only has a 4.3" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basically, you are gaining 0.4" (1.02cm) of extra screen diagonal for very little extra body fat, so HTC deserves credit for that. Keeping the waistline nicely slim is also quite a feat, as large-screen smartphones are quite sensitive to such things.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you look carefully, the HTC One X design isn't too different from that of its predecessors. The lines are basically the same and the elements are distributed in much the same way around the smartphone's body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there's no chance of mistaking that the One X is a generation newer than the Sensation XE. The notably slimmer profile and the polycarbonate unibody really take the general feel up a notch. And that's not even the only benefit of the new material used - the shell of the One X is non-painted much like the one on the Nokia N9 and Lumia 800/900, so it should be able to mask potential scratches quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The low overall weight is another huge advantage of the polycarbonate body. At 130g, the One X is impressively lightweight for its size and that's one of the first things you'll notice when handling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main attraction on the HTC One X front is of course its 4.7" HD Super LCD2. The second generation of Super LCDs is actually a huge step forward from the previous versions and we are not just talking resolution here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X display offers arguably the best image quality of any LCD on the market. Not only is it remarkably sharp (at about 312 ppi, it's virtually impossible to distinguish individual pixels), but also has great contrast and nicely saturated colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see in the table below, the screen is pretty bright as well and its viewing angles are splendid - the icons look almost as if they are painted on the screen. The blacks aren't as deep as those of the AMOLEDs out there, but still great in LCD terms. Sunlight legibility is close behind the market best, which is good enough to not cause any usability issues. Overall, the One X screen has no major weaknesses to speak of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As things currently stand, there are very few smartphones out there who can match the One X for display quality, let alone beat it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, we have the proximity and ambient light sensors to the left of the earpiece and the 720p video call camera on the right. There's a tiny status LED under the earpiece grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen, we find the three controls typical of Android 4.0 ICS which, in the HTC tradition, come in capacitive flavor. The haptic enabled Back, Home and Task switcher keys are well spaced and very responsive. We've been over this already - while ICS dictates on-screen controls, the latest Sense UI requires actual Back and Home buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the HTC One X features the microUSB port, which is used for data transfers, charging and, thanks to its MHL support, TV-out. With an MHL adapter you'll be able to output 1080p content to your HDTV directly from your phone, so purchasing one is probably worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side we find nothing but the super slim volume rocker. With all the fuss HTC made about the One X camera, you would be forgiven for expecting to find a shutter key here, but there is no such thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the 3.5mm audio jack, a microphone pinhole and the Power/Lock key, which is easy enough to hit when needed but still reasonably secure against accidental presses. The microSIM slot is located nearby at the sloping part of the phone's rear body. You need to insert the SIM eject tool located in the retail box or a pin inside the hole next to the slot to access the microSIM tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the HTC One X features the 8MP camera lens and the LED flash right next to it. The camera lens is placed on a bulge and the protective glass may get scratched by surfaces it comes in contact with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other elements at the back are the loudspeaker grille near the bottom and the Beats audio logo right above it. You should keep in mind though that the audio enhancements are only available when you have connected a pair of headphones and not when using the loudspeaker itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was a relief to find out that the HTC One X has none of the death grip issues of its metal-clad predecessors. We suspect that was one of the main reasons why HTC went with polycarbonate this time around. As Nokia made a point about the N9 - a phone with so many antennas simply can't perform properly with a metal unibody.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X is powered by a non-user-replaceable 1800 Li-Ion battery. HTC didn't provide official endurance ratings for it, but our experience showed that it's a pretty decent performer. Despite the large high-res screen we were always able to get a full day of heavy usage without recharging and sometimes even a day and a half.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll be doing a detailed battery test of the HTC One X over the following few days and we'll update the review with the results, so stay tuned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In conclusion, we cannot overstate how impressed we are with the HTC One X's design and build. The smartphone feels really great in hand. The commendable ergonomics and smart use of space go a long way to convince us that a 4.7" smartphone can actually be a popular choice.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense 4.0 on top of Android 4.0 ICS just makes sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X, just like the HTS One S, comes with Android 4.0.3 and Sense 4.0 - both the latest and greatest Google and HTC have to offer. We've already seen those in action on the One S, but One X offers even smoother performance and higher resolution. There are no surprises though, nothing exclusive on the One X that is not present on the One S as well. Still we are going to explore the Android/Sense combo once again for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've already heard about the new screen - it's really awesome and the OS and the Sense UI look even better on its HD resolution than on the One S qHD. The One X offers probably the best smartphone experience up to date - both visual and functional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo video to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC are famous for their deep customizations of the interface of the host OS and the latest version of Sense is no exception, though the Taiwanese have taken user feedback to heart and worked hard to provide a much more unobtrusive experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brilliant lockscreen has been further improved, sealing its position as the most functional, most customizable lockscreen on a smartphone. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, you can drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's not the end of it - the HTC One X comes with eight different lockscreens preinstalled. You can access the others from the Personalize menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get all the old ones - a photo album, Friend Stream, Weather, clock and stocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two new additions though and they're much more functional. The first is called Productivity and lists the latest missed calls, texts, emails and scheduled events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second one is People - you pick a group form your phonebook and a rectangular grid of their contact images will pop up on the lockscreen. Grab one of them and drop them on the ring to view their details. You can have more than one page of contacts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're using the music player, the playback controls show up on the lockscreen (as usual), and you can drag that onto the ring to jump straight into the music player too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you can't download new lockscreens off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have done a lot to streamline the lockscreen and the same goes for the homescreen. Gone is the scrolling indicator arc, gone is the three button dock that wasn't very useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get an auto-hiding indicator of which screen you're on and a brand new dock with five shortcuts - the middle one is locked to the app drawer, while the other four can be customized as you please (you can even put a folder there, if four shortcuts isn't enough).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leap view is still here - tap the home key (while on the default homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out (with an awesome animation) to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes. A small "home" icon indicates the default homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have as many as seven homescreens - and with all the excellent preloaded widgets, you might want to keep all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the biggest complaints was that the Personalize button was just taking up space in the dock at the bottom of the screen. And it was - it has since been moved to the app drawer, but it still offers plenty of customization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary Scenes is one of them - essentially five custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, Play and default). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course, and you can download new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds, but they're a handy feature if you use your One X as both work and personal phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper each and use different colors for various UI elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of horizontal pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetical, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There are Search and Play Store shortcuts along with a menu for some options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom - All apps, Frequent and Downloads. You can rearrange them or remove Frequent and Downloads if you don't need them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Personalize app also has Sound customizations - you can pick a Sound set or individual ringtone, notification and alarm sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding widgets to the homescreen is done in similar fashion to Honeycomb and is one of the less successful changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You press and hold on the homescreen and everything zooms out so that the homescreen panes are visible as thumbnails on the top row of the screen. You tap a homescreen to select it and then select a widget to add to it (or you can just drag the widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a search option to speed things along or you can choose a widget from the dropdown menu and then select which size you like, but that still feels like an extra step.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old setup of picking a widget and then picking the size (if any) seemed simpler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the top of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second "button" is Remove, which deletes the widget as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area no longer has the list of recent apps - it's all available to notifications only. No more tabs and toggles either - you get a Settings shortcut here if you need to power something on or off. There's also a Clear button to dismiss all notification or you can swipe them off one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have remodeled the app switching interface - screenshots are displayed of the running apps, turned slightly to the side. They're ordered horizontally (instead of vertically as is the ICS standard) and you can swipe up to remove them. The not so-good news is that you can only see three of them at a time, even in landscape mode - a waste of screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the old task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update, September 12: We updated the HTC One X to the latest software version available and re-ran the benchmarks. The results have improved noticeably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you already read our HTC One S review you already know what to expect here. The Terga 3 chipset, despite being a quad-core one, is based on the older, Cortex-A9, architecture, so it's not dramatically faster than the latest generation dual-core Krait processors. What's more, on some benchmarks Tegra 3 lagged behind the Snapdragon S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly enough, single-threaded performance wasn't that different as Benchmark Pi shows, but Linpack tested in multi-threaded mode showed that two Krait cores outdo the Tegra 3 quartet. Still, the One X CPU provides plenty of power and chances are you won't be feeling limited by it in the near future.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D graphics department is handled by NVIDIA's own GeForce GPU. On the HD screen of the One X it did 56+ fps, while the Adreno 225 inside the One S does 60 fps on a qHD display, which has just 33% fewer pixels. This means the ULP GeForce GPU does better than the Adreno 225 in terms of pure power.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On SunSpider, the CPU-stressing JavaScript benchmark, the HTC One X posted a blazing fast result, beating all competitors, including the One S. The HTML5 test, BrowserMark, improved quite a bit after the update and now .</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All told, the HTC One X is certainly one of two fastest phones on the market - there's no test in the mobile world it can't pass with flying colors. The dual-core Krait-powered devices might be able to match and at times even outdo it, but you should keep in mind that Nvidia takes good care of its chipsets making quite a few high-quality apps exclusively available to them through its TegraZone store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The One X has HTC's all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it's juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed - you have the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and the fourth one called "Gallery" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transfer app is here to help you switch from your old phone. It supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth. It's an old, but useful trick.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X had no problems with reception and the in-call quality was clear and loud enough. There is no 3G video call support out of the box though, you have to install a third party app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the One X displays your recent calls and the list of favorite contacts underneath. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, Quiet ring on pickup will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC One X fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored an Average mark placing just below the halfway point of our ranking and right alongside its One S sibling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC One X are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's Gtalk, which can connect you to Google's chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered - the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. "drx" matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or about a third in landscape. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the One X boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. While it's still not as good as a hardware one, it's the next best thing - the 4.7" screen has enough real estate for big, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two email clients<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs, but they are hidden by default. You can choose Edit tabs from the menu and pull out the ones you want. You can choose from Favorites, Unread, Marked, Invites and Attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC One X lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery for both offline and online images<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X uses the in-house HTC gallery - a custom app, which stacks photos much like the vanilla Android gallery (it used to display a list of thumbnails). The app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. You can choose to show/hide camera shots, All photos or All videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the Albums dropdown lets you view local albums, albums on a network (DLNA) device or online albums. On the cloud side, you get Facebook, Flickr, Dropbox, Picasa or SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ones you pick one of the "stacks" (each standing for a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. Some photos have an icon indicating it's not a single photo but a burst shot instead. You can later go back and pick the keep or the one to be used as a thumbnail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but you can't copy/paste images across folders - you'd need a proper file manager for that. There are some basic editing tools - crop, rotate and effects (auto enhance, sepia, vintage, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too. Another thing we admire about the HTC gallery is that it displays photos in full resolution, which we believe is a must on a 720p display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the HTC One X is built into the Gallery app - there's no dedicated shortcut inside the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC One X is a huge step forward, compared to what the Sensation XE offered. It comes with a view mode toggle (full screen or best fit) and you can scrub through videos. There's a shortcut that lets you adjust screen brightness and another one to take screenshots of videos. Overall the included options are more than enough and they are all implemented in a nice out-of-the-way manner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X played most files we threw at it - AVI, MP4, MKV - though it did choke on some old XviD AVI videos. Codec support on the video side is excellent - all popular video codecs run at up to 1080p resolution easily. Sound is more problematic and AAC or DTS wouldn't play (that's true for most other phones though, One S included).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of audio, you can choose between Beats Audio, HTC enhancer or No effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitle support is available, though you can't manually pick a subtitle file, so you have to name it the same as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes handy too - the One X can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the MHL port too - if you have the proper adapter, you can hook up your HDTV using an HDMI cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and Beats for all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music app starts off by offering you several shortcuts - music library on the phone, SoundHound track recognition, TuneIn Radio or 7digital. Below is a line that shows a recently played song and further down is the currently playing song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the music library available on the phone you get a dropdown menu to browse it by artist, album, playlist or genre. There's a search tool too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist - you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap the ellipsis to automatically fetch album art for a track or look it up on Google or YouTube. From the Menu you get a Select player option, which is how you can play the song on a DLNA-enabled sound system or over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the phone doesn't come with a Beats headset it supports several of them - iBeats/urBeats, Beats Solo, Beats Pro or Beats Studio. You should pick the correct one as it adjusts the equalizer according to the characteristics of the headset. There's an "Other" option too, but if you're not using Beats you can just pick the one that sounds best to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen shows the album art and name of the song and artist along with playback controls. You can drag this card into the ring to unlock the phone and go straight to the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and they've even integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM radio remains unchanged<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback, which was rather weak on the One X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the headphones or loudspeaker choice you also get Mono sound if the reception is poor. There's no Beats enhancement here though or a playback control card on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have a data connection, you can use 7digital or TuneIn radio instead of relying on your local FM radio stations.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output could be better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After the flawless performance of the HTC One S in our audio quality test, we were hoping its bigger brother will deliver an equally smooth output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the One X certainly started on the wrong foot, producing some pretty poor numbers in when connected to an active external amplifier. In the scenario where the HTC One S was virtually perfect, the One X let quite a lot of distortion creep in. Volume levels are also lower on the X than they used to be on the S, so the overall performance is hardly as impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things weren't perfect when we plugged in a pair of headphones either, even though the degradation wasn't as big as on some other smartphones. The stereo crosstalk takes a dip and the distortion levels increase further, while volume levels are average at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see how the One X did for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera fails to inspire<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels and records 1080p video @ 24fps. There's an LED flash / video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the same for both the still camera and the video camera - no they don't "look alike", the camera just has the UI shared between both functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side features the Effects button, shutter key, camcorder record key and a shortcut to the gallery that shows the last photo taken. On the left is the flash setting toggle, general settings and shot mode (we'll get back to that in a moment).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To snap a photo, you tap the shutter key. To record video you tap the button below - and you can still tap the shutter key to snap a full-res photo, even while recording video. Another cool option is the burst mode, which we mentioned in the gallery - you press and hold on the shutter key and it will snap multiple photos and let you pick which one to keep (you can keep all of them of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a tab on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on). There's also some other cool effects such as shallow depth of field , which lets you blur parts of a photo that fall outside a predefined circular area. It's like having Instagram built right into the camera app UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is pretty cool, but we had one problem with this combined interface - if you want full 8MP resolution still shots, you have to disable the Widescreen option. But then it becomes hard to frame a 16:9 video in the 4:3 view finder. That's made even worse when shooting 720p video. The field of view in that mode is narrower than what the viewfinder shows and framing involves a lot of guesswork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X has touch focus and face detection; geotagging and smile shutter are also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is available too which is good to have on a phone like the One X with no hardware shutter key (the virtual shutter key cannot trigger autofocus either, it does burst mode). On the downside, the continuous autofocus may be way off in some shots - the only way to be certain you have it right is to tap and hold on the spot of the screen where you want the focus to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shot mode button offers some more cool stuff - HDR photos, Panorama (with a gyro horizon), portrait, group portrait, landscape, whiteboard, close-up and, finally, low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Group portrait is quite cool - we've seen something like it before in the Scalado Rewind. It snaps multiple photos and for each face (and the One X can track many faces), the phone automatically picks the one where that person is smiling and didn't blink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC took the camera hardware seriously this time - an f/2.0 aperture and a dedicated image processing chip clearly show they mean business. However the image quality is not quite the best in the 8 MP league - the One X produces rather noisy, if nicely detailed photos. Colors are nice, but tend to be a bit over-saturated at times. Sharpening algorithm is a tad too aggressive, too, resulting in occasional artifacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a bunch of samples for you guys below, check them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera captures images really fast, thanks to the built-in image processing chip. We also liked the fact that images (by default) don't get in the way - once you've snapped a shot it quietly pops-up in the preview box in the bottom right, without instant preview, and you're free to snap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X offers HDR mode too. Here's a comparison of a scene with HDR off and on. The result is okay, but if you don't like the exaggerated HDR look, it might not be your thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped a couple of close-ups with the HTC One X. The focus innately captures macro photos but opting for the dedicated close-up preset does give you an extra millimeter or two to work with. Overall we're pleased with the amount of produced detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC are bragging about the instant photo capture during video recording and we decided to give it a spin. The photos are taken in 16:9 aspect ratio and are in 3264 x 1840 resolution. The idea is that you can snap fast-paced pics while you're recording a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results came out really nice with good detail and motion blur is kept in check. Here are the samples.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X joins the other 8MP shooters in our Photo Compare Tool. The tool's page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first two charts play to the One X strengths and shows it as a good shooter, though still not the best in the 8MP game. The third chart shows good too, but also some artifacts due to the sub-optimal processing of the One X.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording could be better, too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The One X records 1080p or 720p videos at 24fps and it can snap photos while at it. You can also use touch focus and even toggle the video light - that's during recording!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 files and use H.264 encoding. 1080p videos have a rather low bitrate - 10Mbps or less and compression clearly takes its toll on the amount of detail resolved. The colors are a tad oversaturated and while noise is decently low, the One X is hardly the best smartphone for shooting video on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the One X camera boasts stereo audio recording and keeps the framerate close to the promised fps (at least in good light).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p videos captured by the Once X are decent. They only use half the bitrate (makes sense since 720p is about half as many pixels as 1080p). You should keep in mind their field of view is narrower than the 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched sample 1080p@24fps video clip and a 720p@24fps video clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a video uploaded to YouTube for you to enjoy right in your browser. Don't forget to click 1080p on the FullHD video sample and open the video fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also prepped a 720p video sample taken with the One X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X also shoots slow-motion videos but the resolution drops significantly - you get 768x432 at 2.4Mbps bitrate. HTC didn't give an official number, but we measured it at a 3x slo-mo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the HTC One X in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 1080p mobile camcorders. In good light the One X videos tend to be less detailed than those of its competitors (and even the One X). Low light performance is much better though, even if the aggressive noise suppression combined with the high compression rate produces some artifacts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Worry-free connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X packs quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G with HSDPA speeds up to 21Mbps and HSUPA up to 5.76Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already said the death grip problem haunting HTC devices of old is now taken care of and there's nothing to worry about. Wi-Fi reception is strong, as is the cell signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the One X with a PC. The long list of options includes PC Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (the phone becomes a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computer's Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive have large, easy-to-press icons, which comes in handy since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X comes with an MHL port, so if you plug a MHL dongle in, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection. The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV and with the HD resolution of the display, watching on an HDTV is a joyful experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty decent ICS Browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One X comes with the latest version of the Android web browser. Coupled with the HD display and powerful processing power of the One X, the stock ICS web browser performs without hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of its UI is out of sight, leaving the entire screen to the web page. And even when it does appear it consists of a single bar, which holds a back button, a read button and the standard Menu dropdown on the right. The read key aims to show some text-heavy web pages in a distraction-free mode to facilitate reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has also thrown in some extra buttons at the bottom of the screen, which seemed to pop up randomly, which was getting a bit annoying at times. You see sometime those buttons appeared along with the top bar, whereas on other occasions they remained hidden when the top bar was showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those mysteriously behaving buttons let you save a page in your bookmarks or reading list, view bookmarks, saved pages or tabs. You might want to enable Quick controls - they let you tap on any point on the edge of the screen and move your finger to select the desired option from a jog-dial menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner - they can't be swiped off the screen like you do in the app switcher. Incognito tabs are available if you want to browse without leaving traces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Menu options include a toggle to enable/disable Flash and another one to request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another ICS feature has the phone preload search results that it believes are relevant, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the HTC One X has full Flash support and playing Flash videos was a walk in the park. Flash games work like a charm as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer mixes eye-candy with functionality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X features the usual set of organizer applications, with a mobile Office app, capable of both editing and viewing documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word, Excel documents and presentations. There is also a PDF viewer preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can format the style and color of text, as well as justify it, do lists (numbered or bullet points) and that's about it for the Word editor. The Excel editor does support function editing, which some mobile editors don't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also integrates with Dropbox and SkyDrive, which makes syncing documents between your computer and your phone a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation view only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), only one of which you can sync with your computer. You can also easily show/hide the ones you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator on board. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock (also part of the Clock app) is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and zoom in on it freely. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. You also get a stopwatch and a timer in the same app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. You can use the Stocks lockscreen too. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo's weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an HTC-branded flashlight app too - it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Store and HTC Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of wallpapers and sound customizations - ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and HTC Locations show your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X also comes with HTC Locations, an app developed in cooperation with TomTom (software provider) and Route66 (providing the maps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HTC Locations you can download country maps for free, or just cache maps as you browse (the size of the cache is adjustable). Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can even calculate new routes offline, while the Google Maps app only offers rerouting without internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will do voice-guided navigation too, but you'll need a license for that. The One X comes with a trial version worth 30 days of free worldwide navigation. A license for Western Europe will set you back a hefty &#x20ac;40 for a life-time license, the US is $30. Annual and monthly subscriptions are available too. You can also get traffic information and speed camera alerts (&#x20ac;10 for a year for Western Europe, for example). Extra voices are free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better look of what's ahead. It's just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode - at first it seems choppy, but that's only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world). You could use two fingers to rotate the camera manually too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So that's that then - our look at HTC's latest attempt at bringing comprehensive smartphone functionality under one roof is complete and we have to tell you we are pretty impressed with it. The One X is not only surprisingly compact for its screen size and feature set, but also every bit as powerful as the quad-core chipset inside will have you believe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its camera may not be the best in the business and the Sense UI might need some fine tuning, but perfection doesn't really exist in the smartphone game. What's important is that the HTC One X delivers where it really matters, providing as solid user experience as you can hope for and a picture perfect screen, which is a joy to both look at and use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's really easy to recommend the One X to those currently in a search of a cutting-edge smartphone - the specs and design combo it offers can't be matched by any other device currently on the market. We certainly loved the One S for its versatility, but the One X is the proper choice for geeks - Tegra gives you access to exclusive games, the HD display certainly is something and, more importantly, there's more screen estate than on the One S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, you can have both the screen and the Snapdragon S4 chipset in the form of the HTC One XL, though that's yet to come out. AT&amp;T users should be aware that the One X their carrier will offer is actually a version of the XL (confusing, we know).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC One XL ? HTC One X AT&amp;T</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now that we've figured who's who in the One family, it's time to look to other brands for some real HTC One X competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The droid whose name comes up most often when talking One X alternatives is the Samsung Galaxy Note. Packing a larger Super AMOLED screen and extra features which include an S Pen and the Wacom digitizer, the Note has quite a lot going for it. However, it's also notably larger than the One X and thus much harder to slip into your pocket, and also falls a couple of CPU cores short.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note N7000</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own Galaxy Nexus comes as a potential One X rival too, featuring a similarly sized screen of the same resolution (though with a Pentile matrix). Because it's branded from Google, it's also guaranteed a spot in the first wave of any future Android updates. On the other hand, there's no Tegra 3 inside and while trading LCD for AMOLED is normally a no-brainer the display on the Galaxy Nexus is pretty dim, which makes the choice less clear-cut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Nexus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If camera performance is more important to you than the latest and greatest chipset, you might also consider the Sony Xperia S. Not only is the Sony flagship cheaper than the One X, but it also offers 12 megapixel stills of much higher quality. However, the previous-generation Snapdragon, the 4.3" screen and the 10.6mm waistline are hardly going to be the envy of your geek friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems HTC is heading in the right direction after the Taiwanese company altered its strategy. Focusing on fewer high-end products not only allowed for more refined, better polished models, but it probably also helped bring them to market faster. Thanks to that the One X, much like the One S, finds itself in a natural competition-free environment. If HTC plays its marketing and availability cards right, they might manage to turn last year's losses around quite quickly.</paragraph>
