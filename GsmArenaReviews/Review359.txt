			<paragraph>The LG Shine fashion handset was released in two distinct versions. Not long ago we reviewed the KE970 Shine. This time we turn our attention to the LG KU970 ? the 3G version which is to be exclusively sold by Vodafone. They share the same metallic bodies, the same 2 megapixel cameras and the same QVGA TFT display. Other than that software-wise the two Shine handsets are as different as they can be. Be our guest on this tour with the exciting LG KU970 Shine.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Key Features:<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main Disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have followed the LG product line as we do, you would surely make note of the LG Black label series which includes only highly-fashionable handsets. It all started with the LG Chocolate which still remains popular. And as it seems the Korean manufacturer doesn?t have intentions on loosing the speed gained in this market class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Shine is a perfect continuation of the already not so black ?Black label? series. For now the KU970 Shine is a Vodafone exclusive handset which means that guys from Vodafone have left their personal touch making it a unique product in the LG product line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KE970 &amp; KU970 Shine side by side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the LG KU970 Shine looks the same as the one of the LG Chocolate, the only difference being the color combination of the box. The standard kit included is pretty much the same too ? a nice and beautiful LG headset and a data cable. There is no memory card included of course as the KU970 doesn?t have a memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG KE970 Shine and the retail box contents</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sliding along<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KU970 has exactly the same dimensions of 99.8 x 50.6 x 13.8 mm as the KE970 but comes a gram heavier of 120 g. Honestly, the handset doesn?t feel heavy at all and the weight in fact adds for a feel of solidness that is rarely seen in modern mobile phones. Design wise, it?s hard to determine whether it might appeal more to men or women. Truth be told, that due to the mirror finish of the front panel, the most men that saw it commented that it?s probably a handset more suitable for women than for men. Our personal opinion is that the device has a unisex design that should find a wide fan base regardless of the sex.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KU970 has a much more tense spring than the KE970 and it closes with a loud snap. It is possible though that the spring condition is that way because the test KE970 we received has seen a lot of use and abuse before it got to our lab. The device won?t win the slimmest phone prize but yet visually it leaves an impression of a really slim device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The LG KU970 Shine sliding out</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only functional element in the upper part of the front panel is the integrated loudspeaker which is also used as an in-call speaker. Next to it there is a video camera lens used for video calls. Sliding the upper panel reveals the entirely even keypad. As it seems it?s made by a whole metal sheet with the individual keys cut into it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Real-life reflection of the display ? speaker and video camera ? keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The central design piece of the KU970 is without a doubt the navigation scroller and the soft keys. There is more to the LG navigation than what the eye reveals. There are two more keys integrated into each side of the scroller but they are far from obvious. These keys expand the capabilities of the scroller since they allow for side movement in the user interface. The other two soft keys which are positioned further away are contextual keys ? they again are entirely made of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Shine navigation solution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you may have already read in our recent review, the LG KE970 scroller managed to disappoint us from the very beginning. The scrolling navigation was not as responsive as you?d expect it to be ? sometimes a scroll didn?t make any movement in the user interface, sometimes it did more than one. More than often it reacted slower that one would like. The LG KU970 scroller worked much better though so as it seems the functionality is a subject to factory tweaking. Yet. we would have liked it even more responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough on that, let?s return to our description. Much like the KE970, the right side of the LG KU970 Shine is pretty bare and doesn?t feature any control elements. You may spot the neck strap eyehole in the upper part if you pay attention. In much the same way the bottom and upper parts are also bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Right side ? Bottom side ? Top side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is much more interesting as it features the charger/headset port cap, the dual volume key, the MENU shortcut key and the camera shutter key. The MENU shortcut key is the MP3 key we saw in KE970.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Charger/headset port, volume key, MENU key, camera key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the handset around reveals the brushed aluminum back cover and the camera. Looking at it that way, the LG Shine looks like a portable digital camera. Sleek and chic ? those two words can round it up for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG back panel ? camera lens, LED and self-portrait mirror ? the back of the slider</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel covers the whole back side of the handset. When you remove it, the 800mAh Li-Ion battery is revealed as well as the SIM card bed. Just for comparison the battery used in the KE970 was a 750 mAh one. As far as battery life is concerned, we managed to test the KU970 in a 3G network. It managed to do 3.5 days with a moderate usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Removing the back panel ? SIM card bed ? Li-Ion battery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve seen mobiles with displays that have a certain mirror finish but the LG Shine beats them all with its high gloss reflective display surface. As you can see, when the display is off you can hardly see there is a screen out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The glossy LG Shine</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally we were really happy with the design and construction of the LG KU970. The metal body felt good when held in hand and we although the mobile is a bit on the heavy side ? it really is comfortable to use it and carry it in your jeans or shirt pocket.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Using and abusing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Shine display provided for a nice experience ? whether outside or indoors. The legibility remained tolerable under direct sunlight ? something that we didn?t expect having in mind its mirror-like finish. The QVGA resolution is pretty adequate and the images shown on the display had fine and wonderful colors. The brightness levels are user configurable but they provided enough flexibility to allow using the handset with an ease both under strong light and in complete darkness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KE970 Shine display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After commenting on the navigation part of the keypad, let us now concentrate on the alphanumeric part. Typing messages was not the easiest thing to do since there are no tactile differences between neighboring keys. Other than that the individual keys themselves have a nice feedback and typing phone numbers was a pleasant thing to do. It?s got to be noted that as with most sliders, the upper row of the keypad wasn?t easily accessible. The green receiver key proved especially hard to get to. The keys pad has a nice but somewhat uneven blue backlighting as you may see from the pictures taken in total darkness.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ring, ring<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are pretty happy with the LG KU970 Shine when it comes to making and receiving calls. The sound volume is satisfactory and is the same as the one of LG KE970 Shine which comes as no wonder as they have the same hardware. Again much like the KE970 the KU970 doesn?t have a dedicated loud speaker and instead uses the in-call speaker on the front panel for the ringing melodies. Having in mind that dual purpose of the speaker it comes as no surprise that the sound during conversations is really loud and clear. That provides for pleasant conversations even in noisy streets. Both the MIDI and MP3 ringing sound nice and crisp but really lack bass elements.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vodafone interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KU970 Shine doesn?t have much in common with the usual LG user interface. The Vodafone presence is pretty obvious and it is clear that they have tweaked the interface in many ways. Since the user interface of the LG KE970 Shine is among the latest developments of the Korean manufacturer we would use it as a reference when marking the differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen of the handset displays info about the battery status and signal strength. Unlike the KE970, the carrier?s name here cannot be turned off which we regret a lot since we find that a really pleasant feature. In standby the two soft keys correspond to the Music player and the Vodafone Live! shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Standby screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike all the LG GSM phones we have reviewed the LG KU970 has a main menu consisting of a 3 x 4 grid of icons. The graphic icons aren?t different to the ones used in the KE970. Unlike KE970 though the icon are not marked with a number but you still can use the corresponding numeric keys on the keypad as shortcuts for the menu items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The submenus are viewed as a list. Once you open a menu item you can scroll to the other menu items with the navigation roller without the need for returning to the main menu. Here are the nice wallpapers that come preinstalled with the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Some of the preset wallpapers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no themes available for customizing the looks of the interface, but there is the option to change the menu style. Beside the regular 3x3 grid you are given the opportunity to use the list style menu. Unfortunately the highly attractive Arc style we saw in LG KE800 Platinum is not among the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Two possible options: grid style or list style menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In standby each of the four ways of the navigation roller has a predefined shortcut function. If you wish you could visualize the respective assigned functions of the standby screen in order to make your life easier. We found it a preferred option in the first couple of days we used the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the LEFT key takes you to the Messaging menu. Scrolling DOWN naturally takes you to the contacts list. Pressing the RIGHT key opens the Calendar menu and scrolling UP opens a choice of available ringing profiles among which there are three fully customizable ones. What we miss here is the Favorites menu (a list of shortcuts which is user-configurable) which was present on all recent LG GSM phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Standby screen shortcut menu ? Profiles menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a good thing that all the submenu items have numeric shortcuts assigned to them. You can see those in front of every menu item while browsing the menu. The system font used can be changed to a funkier one if you wish. An option like that lacked in other LG phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Numeric shortcut icons in the beginning of each row</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also an interesting option to colorize the phone numbers when dialing. You can choose your favorite color from a preset palette.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is different too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the LG KU970 Shine differs from the KE970?s phonebook in a number of ways. We liked the KE970 phonebook and as you would see there is no reason why not to like the KU970 phonebook too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of 1000 contacts, the KU970 phonebook has available storage space for 500 contacts only but we find that pretty adequate for most people. Unlike KE970, with the KU970 phonebook you can choose whether you wan to see only your phone memory contacts, only your SIM card contacts or both. In KE970, as in all other recent LG GSM mobiles, both lists were displayed simultaneously and there was no option to change that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Phonebook list </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is performed through gradual typing of a name?s characters. In KE970 typing the initial letters of a contact?s name only led to highlighting the searched contact. In KU970 typing even one letter filters the contact lists in order to show you only the contacts which start with that letter ? a much user-friendly solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Searching with several characters</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside all those changes, a significant face lift has received even the graphical way the contact details are presented and edited. Instead unnecessarily large fields, the LG KU970 contact details are presented into a tightly build table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing a contact ? editing a contact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook allows the storing of 5 numbers and 2 emails. Further on the contact can be included into a caller group or can be assigned a picture. You can add several other business details such as company name, company address, etc. You can again add a note to the contact too. It?s good to see that the phonebook has gained a lot in user friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike KE970 now there are no restrictions as regards the size of the pictures that can be assigned to contacts. As usual you can view the contacts along with their respective pictures. It?s a cool, but poses certain inconvenience since the picture hides some characters from the contacts names. A nice innovation in that department though is that with the KU970 the contact image appears with a slide only after you stop at a given contact in the list for a second. Once you continue browsing the images get hidden again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing the contacts with pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign a ringtone to individual contacts as in KE970 Shine. The phone has several preinstalled caller groups which can be customized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Caller groups list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with LG KE970 Shine you can save a second or a third number to an already existing contact directly from the standby screen ? something impossible in the original Chocolate.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nothing special in the call records department. They are available as a separate item in the main menu and also can be accessed by pressing the call (receiver) key. In fact pressing the call key takes you to the general list of all dialed, received and missed calls. If you wish to see the separate registers you have to go to the abovementioned Call History menu item. There is no data counter available as with previous models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Call register menu</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging comes enhanced too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports the sending and receiving of SMS, EMS, MMS and email messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start a new message you are given the option of choosing among a text message or an email. In KE970 we even saw Bluetooth message as an available option but it isn?t one here. If you choose the text type further on you could easily change it by just attaching multimedia content to it and thus turn it into an EMS or MMS. As with KE970 the EMS functionality is not on the level of the original LG Chocolate for some unknown reason. There you could type with highlighted text, set the text alignment, etc. None of those features is available here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messages menu ? typing a test message </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message typing is assisted by T9. Something that isn?t available here is the Auto Draft saving that the KE970 and the other LG mobiles perform - if you have started a new message and all of a sudden you have to cancel its typing, it?s saved automatically as a draft and the next time you decide to start a new message the phone not only stores it for you but automatically opens it for you to continue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports the POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP protocols and as regards sending and receiving text emails it successfully does it job as we managed to found out during the test period. It comes pre-configured for the Vodafone live! email service but new accounts can be added. As regards emails with file attachments a nice development is that it allows sending or downloading messages with attachments of up to 1 MB. In all the previous models the maximum size was only 300KB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All the right stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KU970 has 512MB of integrated memory and no memory card slot. The effectively available memory to the user in fact is around 488MB. The File manager appears as a My files item in the main menu. It includes separate factory preset folders for different multimedia content. In fact these folders are the only one you will see since the file manager doesn?t actually support user-created folders. You can create subfolders you cannot add ones to the root of the My Files. You can mark, copy or move files only within the designated multimedia group. For example you cannot copy image files to the music folder. Then again you can of course copy or move files to the external memory or send them through Bluetooth connection and for all of those options you can rely on multiple marking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> My Files menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KE970 managed to impress us with its office document viewer functionality. It?s a rather innovative feature for a non-OS mobile phone and it?s certainly a first for LG GSM mobile phones. The viewer supports MS Word documents, MS Excel files and PDF files. Unfortunately, no such support was found in KU970 ? it isn?t even capable of opening plain TXT files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally speaking, the file browser of the LG KU970 provides basic functionality. As with LG KE970 you no longer need to view picture files by opening and closing them one by one as it was with the original LG Chocolate phone. You can view pictures fullscreen and you can even see the pictures in their full size while making use of a nice browsing feature. Unfortunately the landscape view functionality that we saw in KE970 lacks here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As in KE970 the thumbnail view browsing of the available pictures has received a speed boost and now it works much more natural. It has got to be pointed out though that the KE970 manages to load the thumbnails quicker than the KU970.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Playing some music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The lack of memory card slot, a flight mode, and playlist support made the music player of the original LG Chocolate rather inadequate. Some of those issues have been taken care of in the LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum. But still, it lacked an option for creating custom playlists ? its player listed all the available MP3 files. The KE970 Shine however now supports user-created playlists and we are pretty happy with it. The only downside is that as with all previous models you can?t sort the tracks according to artist or album but only by file name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the music player of the KU970 is entirely a different story. The device itself doesn?t have a memory card slot (all you have are the 512MB on board) and doesn?t feature a Flight mode ? obviously the lack of those two features alone makes the KU970 inappropriate choice for a music phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the KU970 does support user-created playlists much like the KE970 and the player can run in the background. So we are not pretty clear about where to position the device as to its music orientation. Obviously the people who made it don?t have a clear idea about it either. Vodafone is well known for their disapproval of MP3 maybe due to licensing reasons. They?ve been known to actually strip some Vodafone-branded mobiles of their MP3 support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore the music player doesn?t have any equalizer presets that you can use in order to enhance the player sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound is really nice when you use stock headphones without turning on some special equalizer preset. However, when you use the supplied LG headphones you would definitely feel the lack of the equalizer for tuning in the sound.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Schneider-Kreuznach lens<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we saw the 2 megapixel auto focus camera of the KE970 Shine which we reviewed recently had improved auto focus capability and it didn?t miss most of its intended subjects as it did with the previous model KE800 Platinum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The situation with the KU970 is pretty much the same as with KE970 ? after all the two devices are almost hardware twins. Unusually the KU970 camera performed slightly quicker at taking pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The auto focusing still takes 2 seconds as with KE970 but the saving time has been reduced to only 5 seconds which is a nice achievement ? 2 seconds faster than the KE970.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although that the KU970 doesn?t have a dedicated Macro mode in the camera menu, the device managed to impress us with great results from distances such as 3-5 cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is also equipped with a LED flash which is there to help you in poor light conditions. Unlike the one on KE970 this one can be set to flash out only in the split moment of taking a picture ? much like on a digital camera. Besides that the LG KU970 Shine has a night mode which does it job very well and compared to night modes in similar cameras produces relatively low photo noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG KU970 camera viewfinder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the same as the one of KE970 as regards the graphics. As regards the available options the differences are more than one or two. Besides the already mentioned flash settings, night mode settings and macro mode settings, it is also worth pointing out that unlike KE970, the camera shutter tone of the KU970 cannot be turned off. Further on unlike KE970 you can now switch between still camera and video camera seamlessly without first restarting the camera application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise the camera menu offers all other standard options such as picture resolution, brightness level, the white balance that has several presets according to the available light conditions, and some color effects such as sepia, black &amp; white, negative, etc. Beside the regular Single shot mode the camera can also capture images in Multi shoot mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Various camera settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our photo quality tests LG KU970 Shine produced better results than the identically equipped KE970. The noise levels were low, the colors were close enough to the real colors of the scenes. Our only complaint is the high contrast, which combined with the low dynamic range of the small sensor resulted in over-exposed areas even in correctly exposed photos. You can compare the sample photos of KU970 to the ones produced by KE970.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>            Sample LG KU970 Shine camera photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice upgrade in the camera department is that unlike KE970 which only supports QCIF resolution for video recordings, the KU970 camera can captures video in maximum resolution of 320 x 240 pixels (QVGA). The output format is the usual .3gp (it was MP4 for the KE970). The menu of the video camera is pretty much the same as the one we already described for the still camera with few exceptions. It offers both limited and unlimited recording.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity this time falls behind<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Up until now we?ve been great fans of LG USB cable support ? seamless, quick and easy. You rarely see that in feature mobile phones nowadays. The situation with KU970 is a bit different though. Being sold and tweaked by Vodafone it seems that the direct ?no-divers-needed? USB support has been done with. The test unit we received came with a USB cable but with no software whatsoever so we failed miserably at trying to establish any cable connection between the PC and the mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As much as other connectivity options are concerned, the phone features 3-band GSM/GPRS 900/1800/1900 support plus HSDPA (3.6 Mbits), as well as Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated WAP browser in the previous LG GSM phones we reviewed didn?t have full HTML support and managed to open only simple HTML pages such as Google. It was a regular WAP browser used in older phones and it wasn?t able to open the GSMArena.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser integrated in the KE970 Shine and in the KU970 Shine is on par with the web browsers used in most recent mobile phones which is a big plus for LG. It doesn?t feature zoom and landscape mode, but well, we can live without that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A plus of the KU970 browser over the one of KE970 is only the Rendering mode setting that the KU970 has. What it practically means is that the browser can fit all the content on the mobile screen eliminating the need for horizontal scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But after all you can always install the Opera Mini Browser as an additional Java application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The web browser</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calendar and other tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward ? it offers a monthly view for navigation among the dates. Once you find the date you need, simply enter it and add an event. Finally, the option for the first day of the week is user configurable. There is even a weekly view now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Monthly view ? the new weekly view? daily view ? adding an event</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Memos feature that allows for storing some notes. The Tools menu also stores some other useful applications, though they seem rather standard nowadays. There are the Alarms, the Calculator, the Unit converter, the Sound recorder and the World time clock. Unlike LG KE800 Platinum and LG KE970 which had only 1 alarm, the LG KU970 has 5 of them for your ?alarming? pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator has a different interface as compared to the one in KE970 which had a completely redesigned calculator tailor-made to work seamlessly with the new navigation solution. In terms of functionality it resembles the calculator used in previous LG models. The Unit Converter also has a nice list of units such as Currency, Area, Length, Weight, Temperature, Volume, and Velocity. There is also a World Time application that is rather basic and doesn?t have anything to do with the nice application we saw in KE970.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Calculator ? unit converter ? converting area units ? world time application</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the KE970 Shine, the Voice recorder application of the KU970 has a 1-minute limitation in the duration of the recorded files but again, unlike the KE970 you can choose the audio quality level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The voice recorder</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our test LG KU970 came loaded with games ? as always Vodafone branded mobiles are multimedia-oriented and we would like to put the games in the category of multimedia of course. Unfortunately, all the games are trial editions or are incomplete versions of the original ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never mind, the games we found preinstalled in the KE970 are Brain Genius, PAC MAN, Platinum Solitaire, Puzzle Bobble, Tetris, and Tower Bloxx. We won?t go into details about the games and we would just post you some screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Brain Genius quiz game ? PAC MAN ? Platinum Solitaire ? Puzzle Bobble ? Tetris ? Tower Bloxx</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we saw the LG KU970 is a bit aside from the regular development line of LG GSM phone interface. It resembles the early interface of the Black Label series but with certain upgrades not seen in other handsets. Yet other mobiles by the Korean manufacturer come much better equipped in terms of interface functionality ? a nice example is the KE970 Shine which is probably the most mature product by LG in terms of user interface. We do not consider that to be a drawback of the KU970 however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It managed to surprise us with nice battery life, a nice autofocus camera, and solid construction. There are a number of features that made the device an unsuitable all-in-one multimedia device. The lack of a memory card slot and a Flight mode really state it clear: the LG KU970 is not your next MP3 player. If you are not in desperate need of a fashionable 3G handset, but the really like the KE970 design as much as we do, you would be better off by choosing the non-3G LG KE970 Shine we reviewed not long ago.</paragraph>
