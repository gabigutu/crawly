			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows phone models aren't that many, which makes sense as the platforms has a market share of less than 2%. Among those phone models, the ones which are not made by Microsoft, are few and far between. So the Acer Liquid Jade Primo is a specimen of a rare breed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Jade Primo is a flagship-grade device, up there with Microsoft's own Lumia 950. And just like Microsoft took its time with coming up with a smartphone (okay, two) to fly the Windows 10 banner, Acer has been in no rush to release the Jade Primo - announced at last year's IFA in September, it's yet to make it to the shelves but yes, we've got one early. This might explain why the Primo uses last year's Snapdragon 808 as opposed to the more current Snapdragon 820. Have no worries, Windows 10 has been known to cruise on even Snapdragon 2xx, so we expect nothing but a smooth sailing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Liquid Jade Primo comes with an 5.5-inch AMOLED screen - arguably the best display tech for the Windows black backgrounds. Unlike the high-end Lumias, resolution has been kept at a conservative 1080p, for better or worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get Windows Continuum, a properly-equipped 21MP camera with 4K video, an 8MP front shooter (boo, 5MP Lumias!), Wi-Fi ac, USB Type-C connectivity - pretty much everything but the kitchen sink. Okay, unless you want to swap batteries and unlock with a fingerprint reader - those particular features are a no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plenty of affordable midrange Android smartphones come with a fingerprint scanner, but we're yet to see one on a Windows device, so we're not going to hold a grudge with the Jade Primo on this one. Battery capacity raises eyebrows though, even more so when the Lumia 950 did rather poorly with more juice - we'll see whether Acer will be able to pull off a miracle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, you're not terribly spoiled for options in the higher-end of the Windows Mobile spectrum, and that might help you look past some (or all) of the Jade Primo's shortcomings. Join us on the following pages to see where they hide.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our review sample arrived in a rather unique-looking package. Inside a paper sleeve with a printed pattern which mimics the phone's back panel, you'll find a cardboard box with what looks like a coarsely woven textile finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The box contains an AC adapter, rated at 5.35V/2A, and a thick but short USB Type-A to Type-C cable. The commercially available bundles will also include a headset, we've been told.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Jade Primo 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Jade Primo measures 156.5 x 75.9 x 8.4 mm, which is larger than the Lumia 950 in every direction. And while the 5.5-inch display warrants the increased dimensions over the 5.2-inch 950, the Jade Primo is actually taller and thicker than the 5.7-inch 950 XL. It's barely smaller in footprint than our benchmark in wasteful use of space - the iPhone 6s Plus. Sorry, Apple, you suck at bezels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of weight, the Jade Primo has the scales balanced with the Lumia 950 - both weigh 150 grams. The Acer's slightly larger display coupled with a slightly smaller battery seems to be a logical explanation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Polycarbonate is what the Liquid Jade Primo is made of, despite appearances. The back panel poses for brushed metal, and does a convincing job of it, but it's plastic nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer likes the plughole design for its smartphones' speakers and the Jade Primo has one such circular grille as well. It has to be said though, that the look has been refined since the Liquid Jade and is now less obtrusive and attention-grabbing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera module up top is a more traditional element - a circular bulge to accommodate the f/2.2 lens in front of the 21MP sensor. Right next to it are the dual-tone flash and the secondary mic pinhole. Both the camera and speaker are accented with a shiny silvery ring to match the prominent company logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is nicely curved, which makes it feel comfy in the hand and thinner than it actually is. The finish also makes fingerprints one less thing to worry about - it's nearly impossible to leave a mark on the phone and that's a rarity these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The outer frame is also treated to a shiny paintjob, but on top of that you get tapered strips of black. It looks okay, but it could have just as easily lived without it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is pretty busy. The power button is located just under the midpoint and the volume rocker is above it. Some of us feel like the two should be on separate sides, while others are entirely indifferent on the matter, but the former often found themselves pressing the volume rocker, trying to wake up the Primo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further up we have two separate card trays, bottom one takes a nanoSIM card, the top one takes a second nanoSIM or a microSD card. Why not both, we hear you say, and that's one we've been complaining about for a while, but such is the state of the affairs. On a more positive note, the two trays are different enough for you not to be able to insert them the wrong way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Left side? Nothing to see here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top is home to the 3.5mm jack and nothing else. Other manufacturers put the secondary mic here, but the Primo's is on the back. On the bottom you have the USB Type-C port and the primary mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the front the plughole theme continues with the ear piece, much smaller than the rear-mounted speaker. The 8MP front camera is to its right, while the sensor array is on its other side. There's nothing but Acer's logo on the chin, and both top and bottom bezels feel unnecessarily large.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Jade Primo is equipped with a 5.5-inch FullHD display, and the math results in a 401ppi pixel density. It's an AMOLED panel, which makes the live tiles really pop out on the default black backgrounds. The Diamond Pentile subpixel arrangement is par for the course with such displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Jade Primo posted an okay maximum brightness at 372 nits - AMOLEDs don't typically fly high in this respect. Black pixels are kept unlit, thus contrast is infinite, which can otherwise be classified as excellent. What is rather disastrous is the minimum level of brightness. The Jade Primo's lowest setting results is 70nits, which potentially could be eye-poking in a dark environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an average DeltaE of 5.8, the Jade Primo is a decent performer when it comes to color rendering accuracy, but it's not what you'd call properly calibrated - a value lower than 3 is an indication of that. Still, those are truer colors than Samsung's latest flagships produce in default mode, though admittedly they can achieve truly excellent results in other modes, which however lack here. Unlike on the Lumias, there is no way to tune the color rendering or the screen color temperature on the Jade Primo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AMOLED is typically a great recipe for outdoor visibility and we expected the Jade Primo to ace that test. Indeed it did good, on par with the Lumia 950, but that's not exceptional performance for an AMOLED panel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Liquid Jade Primo is a dual-SIM device, with 2G cellular connectivity on both cards, and 3G/4G on one of them (defined in settings). The second SIM slot is shared with the microSD slot - you can't have both SIMs and a microSD in at the same time. The supported LTE is of Cat. 6 for theoretical speeds of 300Mbps down and 50Mbps up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, Wi-Fi Direct and hotspot support. There's GPS with A-GPS, and Bluetooth 4.0, but no FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best bits about Windows 10 is Continuum - the ability to transform your smartphone into a desktop of sorts just by connecting to an external display and adding peripherals. The Acer Liquid Jade Primo is one of select few smartphones that can do it for the time being - you only have to use the dedicated dock Acer D01, which supposedly will be sold separately. The dock provides power and wired connectivity options, but more on than in the dedicated chapter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Jade Primo battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A rather modest 2,800mAh battery powers the Acer Liquid Jade Primo. The Lumia 950 has a full 3,000mAh worth of juice, for a smaller (admittedly higher-res) display and same chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tests didn't really confirm our initial specsheet-based worries, and one area even delivered a pleasant surprise. You can go ahead and call the Primo's endurance in video playback excellent. Thirteen full hours on a 5.5-inch FullHD display with such a small battery is downright impressive. For reference, the Lumia 950 is good for less than 10 hours in this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surfing the web, the Jade Primo can last you 7 and a half hours, on par with the Lumia 950 - not really record breaking, but a number we could learn to live with. Microsoft's offering does disappointingly in voice calls (8:25h), while the Liquid Jade Primo would keep on going for 14h - not exceptional, more like average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an overall endurance rating of 56h, the Acer Liquid Jade Primo is just average with the notable exception of exemplary video playback longevity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary rating denotes the number of hours the phone will be operational if you are to make an hour of 3G talks, web browsing and video playback per day. Such usage pattern is of course somewhat artificial, but we've established it so our battery results are comparable across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Windows 10 Mobile is virtually the same as on a Lumia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Jade Primo runs on Microsoft's latest Windows 10 Mobile. The company is so committed to making it work, that its CEO once said that if no other manufacturers are willing to make Windows phones, Microsoft itself will. Well, Acer for one, is willing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new OS (well, it should be in a sort of adolescence already) builds upon the established principles of Windows Phone 8, but comes with an entirely new OS core, very similar to the one inside the full-blown desktop Windows 10 and the Xbox One's Windows 10. This is part of Microsoft's strategy of unification among its device lineup and should help developers easily deploy apps across the different devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On phones that means a Live Tile homescreen, the all apps list, the action center with toggles, and a tightly organized settings menu. It's practically the same as on one of Microsoft's own Lumias, perhaps without a few proprietary features. But then, Windows 10 is pretty consistent from one desktop to another, so why should it be any different on mobile?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that Acer omitted is the glance screen, the screen is entirely blank in standby. The lockscreen is business as usual - five apps can show you quick status (notifications), and you have the option to let one app display detailed status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Hello is built into Windows 10, but since the Liquid Jade Primo lacks fingerprint or iris recognition, the only option for sign-in security is a PIN.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 10 Mobile supports only two homescreens, just like Windows Phone 7 and 8. The main screen has all your live tiles, static icons and folders, while the second screen has a scrollable list of apps. You can resize the tiles as usual, pinning a tile is very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tile screen supports two types of backgrounds - behind the tiles (full screen) or on-tiles. Naturally you can choose the tile grid from settings (big or small) and there is a new option for tile transparency, which is really cool if you are using a full-screen wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also change the color scheme of the interface (black and white are available) and pick from a number of possible accent colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Center is what the quick toggles and notification shade are collectively called in Windows. On the Primo you get 5 toggles in a row in three rows total. It works just like on Android OS - you access it by pulling down from the top of the screen, dismiss all notifications key is available. You can expand all toggles as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft likes Apple's way of handling apps running in background - most of the apps are suspended upon hitting the Windows key and will be resumed once you bring them back. There are others, of course, such as Navigation, Cortana and Battery apps, which will continue to run in background unless you specifically kill them. So, any app, which needs to run in background, will do so, while the rest would get suspended.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not the best implementation then, to summon the task manager with a long press on the back key - long presses take time, and it's not very logical to be forced to wait so long for an action that you're supposedly going to be doing constantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Which brings us to one issue we experienced with the Jade Primo - tapping the capacitive navigation keys in their bottom part often doesn't work. You need to hit them squarely, and erring on the upper side results in tapping on a tile. And with the huge bottom bezel you actually tend to be tapping low, rather than high. We never quite got used to that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One-handed mode is another area where Microsoft might have taken a hint from Apple - tap and hold the Win key and your entire UI will drop down at your fingertips.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Cortana digital assistant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's Cortana does what Apple's Siri and Google Now do - it recognizes your voice commands and questions in natural human language and gives you spoken replies and feedback. It shows a very nice summary of your day upon launch (the weather, events and meeting, important news, sports scores), based on your location, search history and predefined interests (in your Notebook, which you can edit any time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana can fully interact with your phone and carry out all kind or commands related to it. Cortana can also track various news topics, makes suggestions for cooking and dinner, plan trips, find places and make reservations, make jokes, among other things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like where Microsoft is heading with Cortana - it may have been around for a short time, but it has already catch up quite impressively.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Continuum<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Continuum is one of Windows 10's headline features, meant to turn your smartphone into a portable PC to do basic tasks on the go. Provided you have a monitor and peripherals handy, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, since it requires some serious computing power, few Windows phones support it. Well, the Acer Liquid Jade Primo is one of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To take advantage of Continuum on the Primo you need its matching dock, model name Acer D01. It's unclear yet whether one will be bundled with the smartphone, or you'll need to get it separately, or maybe some regions will be luckier than others. Either way, we have one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock is made specifically for the Jade Primo and has a design to match it. The brushed metal theme continues with some glossy black plastic thrown in for good measure. On the left side, you have an HDMI port for connection to a monitor and a USB 3.0 port while on the right there are 2x USB 2.0 ports and a dedicated DC input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You need to connect the dock to a monitor, add power, keyboard and mouse and you're good to go. The UI you'll see on the monitor won't just be a 1:1 representation of the handset's screen. Instead, the phone is turned into a makeshift PC. Wireless Bluetooth peripherals work too, but of course, you connect them to the phone, not the dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, it's a Windows Desktop, the same one you see every day on your Windows 10 PC but without the icons and a right click action on the mouse, except in some apps. Upon connection you see your phone's Start screen on the left side of the monitor, but if you open a universal app that will take over the whole width of the monitor. So you'll have no wasted space, and you'll be able to do some work in a much easier way than if you were to glance at a representation of your phone's screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The taskbar is there, Cortana, Task View, and the Start Menu making much more sense now as it's your phone's screen. You can continue using your Primo, while it's connected to the dock, for phone calls and what not. Alternatively, you can use it as a touchpad though we don't see upright trackpads as terribly practical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, all the usual PC keyboard commands work in this mode, so you can use Ctrl+C for copying, Ctrl+V for pasting, and so on. Microsoft says it wants to let smartphones scale up to a full PC-like experience, and they've done a great job out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, is Continuum worth it? Sure, but there are lots of limitations you should be aware of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, you can't install Win32/Win64 desktop apps, just ARM-compatible from the Windows Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you hook all the necessary cables to the dock (the phone, the charger, the HDMI cable, keyboard (optional) and mice (optional), you are ready to go. There is no need of drivers or additional app installations; the Continuum app launches up automatically, and your screen will light up with a Windows desktop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As promised, you can still use your phone while you are using the Continuum screen. You can make calls, check emails or write messages. You can explore photos or shoot with the camera. You can't open the same app twice, though, so if you have Photos open in Continuum and try to open it on your Lumia screen, it will just move to your phone display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no actual desktop to put app shortcuts and files on it. It's just a static picture needed to fill the blank space. Your actual desktop is the Start menu, which doubles your phone's default Start homescreen. All apps pane is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the default apps are Continuum-enabled, but most of the Store app aren't. They need to be updated for Continuum to work, but we hope the devs will do sooner rather than later. The incompatible with Continuum apps are grayed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you are running in Continuum mode, most of the essential shortcuts you are used to in Windows work just fine - copying, paste, explorer (launches the phone's file manager, though), but not Show Desktop as there is no desktop to show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Side by side snapping of windows is not possible, neither is multi-tasking. The apps, which are automatically minimized upon opening another, just go in suspended mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Edge browser, Word, Excel, and One Note ran smooth and looked a lot like their Desktop counterparts. You can indeed do more with Continuum and replace some of your Desktop functionality, but not all of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Edge, for example, you also get right click functionality, as well as middle-button click to open a link in new window or close a tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Continuum works fine and with the expanding app portfolio, it will find its loyal users and probably expand the Windows user base and market share.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Jade Primo comes with a Snapdragon 808 chipset inside, which may not be too impressive in today's Android world of Snapdragon 820's and Exynos 8890's. Among its Windows peers, however, it sits very high up the ladder. Microsoft's Lumia 950 XL packs Qualcomm's top dog from last year (S810), while the plain 950 has the same chip as the Primo. Come summer, the HP Elite X3 will join the race, Snapdragon 820 blazing, but that's a pretty long wait.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 808 is a perfectly capable SoC, though, don't get us wrong. It does a fine job inside both the Lumia 950 and LG G4 from last year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One slight hiccup with measuring benchmark performance on the Liquid Jade Primo is that not all of our usual tests can run on it, the limited app selection on Windows being the culprit. We did subject it to a few runs of Antutu 6, and it did alright. For reference, Acer's phone scores about 60% higher than the Lumia 650 (entry-level Snapdragon S212).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Basemark OS II 2.0 the Primo even manages to beat the Lumia 950, if only barely. The Nexus 5X gets the highest score here from a device with a Snapdragon 808 heart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Graphics performance isn't overly exciting, The Nexus 5X with the same chipset and resolution delivers 16fps vs. the Primo's 12fps in offscreen 1080p rendering, and the difference stretches to 17 vs. 11 fps, then those frames need to be displayed. Both The LG G4 and Moto X Style perform better in the offscreen test though they're hampered by higher resolution in the onscreen run.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and contact management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People Hub hasn't changed much since Windows Phone 8.1. It is the phonebook that you'll find on any Windows device and supports multiple accounts, including social ones, and has multiple pages like the rest of the WP interface. The first page is your contacts list with slightly updated looks, the second one is What's New with all of your friends' social updates (Facebook and Twitter), and Groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the complications are gone for good such as the social updates for each contact and its complete history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cell reception and call quality are very good and we had no receptions issues or unpleasant sound problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Liquid Jade Primo scored a Good rating in our loudspeaker test. While it is indeed pretty loud, it tends to start playback at at a higher level, and then dials it down, perhaps trying to protect the speaker from overload.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality starts off impressively, loses points with headphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Jade Primo did excellently when plugged in an active external amplifier. Matching high volume to perfectly clear output the smartphone really aced this part of the test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there as plugging in a pair of headphones really harmed the stereo quality by introducing plenty of crosstalk and the frequency response became shaky. Some intermodulation distortion crept in and volume dropped to below average levels for a rather disappointing showing on this occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messaging is straightforward with a threaded view of your conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard on the Jade Primo is Windows standard-issue, as well. It lacks a separate number row - you need to tap the symbols key to get those, but it has a virtual joystick for navigation, and supports emojis. It's also resizable, and can be undocked from the bottom to position it wherever you feel like it. Swipe input is supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native email client is the mobile version of Outlook Mail. It looks a lot like its desktop app and works like a charm. It supports multiple accounts, and syncs across all your Windows devices. It is available on Android and iOS as well and we often prefer it over other solutions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first and most notable new app is Photos. It s default view displays your entire collection of pictures minus the screenshots. It is also capable of aggregating all of your OneDrive photos and listing them along with your camera snaps. You can turn on/off the OneDrive picture syncing from settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app offers an Albums view too - it allows you to quickly organize, edit and share multiple pictures or albums with your friends and family via OneDrive links.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is very easy to select, delete and share multiple images. A limited editing option is available as well with support for rotation and crop.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Groove Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Groove Music takes care of your music playing needs. Groove Music service is integrated within the app and offers streaming and downloading music the same way Google Music and Apple Music does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Groove Music sorts your local music by albums, artist, songs and playlists. It covers all the usual requirements for a music player, supports editing playlists and comes with a nice and clean interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groove Music app supports playing the music you've uploaded onto your OneDrive storage, which is quite useful sometimes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is rather basic though. For example, there's no equalizer to be found anywhere. Lumias have one buried in the settings menu, but not the Primo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Movies and TV<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Movies and TV app supports Microsoft's video service, and you can buy or rent video content. Local playback is very easy thanks to the clean interface. You can browse by folders if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles are supported, just hit the subs virtual key and you will be able to choose a file (from the current video folder only).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>21MP camera creates great images, experience is less so<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Jade Primo is equipped with a 21MP f/2.2 primary camera, which shoots still images up to 5,344 x 4,016 pixels in a 4:3 native aspect ratio. That sounds an awful lot like the imager on the Moto X Play and Moto X Style, though coupled with a dimmer lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app interface is very much identical to the one on any other Windows-powered smartphone. It's minimalist, yet you have all the important features. Sure it would be nice to be able to select resolutions instead of just the aspect, and even as it is, it would be helpful to know the resolution that corresponds to the selected aspect, but that must be asking too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Camera app is available across all Windows 10 Mobile devices and shares an identical interface - a top expandable bar with settings, plus an additional pop-up ring-based interface on the right side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access all of the rings simultaneously by sliding the on-screen shutter button to the left. This will stack sliders for all six settings next to one another allowing you to easily fiddle with them all at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings (white balance, focus, ISO, shutter speed and exposure) you modify are kept at the values you chose, with the others adjusted accordingly by the software. We really like this interface - it's intuitive and powerful at the same time. It would have been splendid if the various framing aids were actually properly aligned - they aren't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shooting experience is far from ideal. The camera feels rather sluggish, and there's a noticeable delay between the moment you press the shutter and the phone actually taking the shot. After a shot the camera scans the entire focus range again, in anticipation of the next shot, and should you fire during that period, you get whatever focus distance the camera is at at the moment. You're best off waiting for the entire ordeal to end and snap then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Often times you would point the camera at a subject, and it wouldn't autofocus until you tap somewhere in the frame. Take the first shot though, and it would do its post-shot refocus routine and subsequent photos will be fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, as for image quality, the Acer Jade Primo is capable of some stunning results in good light. Sharp images full of detail, albeit with some more noise than ideal. The auto exposure does a good job at handling high-contrast daylight scenes, and coupled with the wide dynamic range, the Primo makes wonderful casual snaps in the proper settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode comes with a pretty big setback before you even look at the output - it's slow. We understand that it involves heavier processing, but it's not like the Snapdragon 808 is exactly lacking in computing power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, HDR shots are usable, but the effect is probably a touch too dramatic, particularly in the shadows. Some of the sharpness is lost along the way, though nothing to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the light levels drop, things get messy pretty quickly. To the point that night-shots are an exercise best avoided.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The poor performance in low light can be examined further in out Photo compare tool, and it makes for a curious contrast with the excellent output in good light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Acer Liquid Jade Primo in our photo compare tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera of the Liquid Jade Primo is a fixed-focus 8MP unit with an f/2.2 aperture. While it does resolve a lot of detail, it has pretty limited dynamic range, and very often struggles with white balance. That sometimes means dull colors with a strong cold bluish tint to them, and in other occasions it leans towards too warm reproduction (though it was sunset at that time).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Spectacular 4K videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Liquid Jade Primo is capable of recording 2160p (4K) video at 30fps, 1080p at 30fps and 720p at 30fps. That's it, there are no fancy slow motion or high framerate 1080p@60fps modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4K videos have a bitrate of about 52Mbps and audio is recorded in stereo at 192Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More important than the numbers, UltraHD videos shot on the Liquid Jade Primo are just astonishingly good. The level of resolved detail is simply unrivaled, and there's no smartphone that has come to headquarters to match the Liquid Jade Primo in this respect. The overall texture, the preservation of intricate detail in the roof tiles and foliage in every frame, it all makes it look like a still shot, or a frame from a high-end camera's 4K video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that doesn't come at the expense of unnecessarily large files - the 52Mbps bit rate is identical to the one on the Lumia 950/950 XL, and a marginal 8% higher than the Galaxy S7's 48Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard to find fault with other areas of the Primo's 4K output either. Fine detail is nicely rendered, saturation isn't unnecessarily pumped up and colors are reproduced conservatively, but yet faithfully.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For all its peculiarities in still image autofocus, there's not much to complain in the video department. If anything, the shadows may be a touch too dark, but that's really nitpicking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p footage is very good, but very good 1080p capture isn't that hard to come by. Captured at a rather standard 18Mbps bit rate, the videos have largely the same properties as their 4K counterparts, only the level of detail is not as trend-setting, there are sharper FullHD videos out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the untouched video samples: 4K at 30fps (12s, 71MB), 1080p at 30fps (21s, 39MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Microsoft Edge is your browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Web browsing on your Windows-powered Liquid Jade Primo takes place inside Microsoft's Edge browser. It supports bookmark sync with your Microsoft account, there is Reading list, Reading mode, incognito tabs and download manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>App package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile comes with a rich preinstalled set of apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First - you get the latest versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Creating, viewing or editing documents and presentation is very easy, as is taking notes and checklists. It's the best office suite out there and has tight integration with OneDrive, which means you will be getting all of your files synced across all of your devices, no matter the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All apps from the MS office suite support Continuum and expand just awesome in full-blown desktop mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneDrive is onboard of course, and aside from its tight integration into other apps, you can access it from its dedicated piece of software. Its user interface is getting friendlier by the day and many people are already preferring it over Dropbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All other organizing tools are available at first run - there are Outlook Calendar, Alarms, Calculator and Weather apps. The Calculator is one of the best apps of this kind we've encountered so far, in that it can do a lot of stuff: scientific and programmer calculators, various volume, length, weight, temperature, energy, speed, time, power, pressure, angle conversions, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it'll never cease to boggle the sane mind why 2+2*2=8 in Standard mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's News app is available, too. It aggregates stories from a plethora of sources and gives you the option to select a regionally targeted edition depending on where you are in the world or just personal preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The updated Xbox app is here too, you can view and compare achievements, chat with your friends, invite them to game sessions, edit your avatar, among other things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You still need to play with a controller though, so you'll have to get a proper accessory to combine the wireless controller with your Windows smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can shop Xbox One and Windows 10 apps from here as well, and they will later install on your console or PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the new Windows Maps app, based on Here map data, allows you to search for places, view nearby POIs, and, of course, it can do turn-by-turn voice-guided navigation. Offline maps are available, too, as well as 3D aerial views of select cities around the world.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Jade Primo key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The polycarbonate body is well-built, handles well and is quite smudge-proof. The design aesthetics may be debatable, but the circular accents do a good job at expressing the brand identity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.5-inch AMOLED Full HD display has reasonably accurate colors, about average maximum brightness, and good visibility in the sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extraordinarily bright minimum brightness level means your eyes may hurt when you use it in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is better than the capacity would suggest but no more than average in absolute terms. It does last a commendable 13 hours in video playback, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface tends to be a bit slow, not a deal-breaker, but enough to annoy you at times while waiting for a pointless transition to take place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuum has its uses, but we're yet to be convinced it's all that Microsoft is hyping it up to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio quality is great with an external amplifier but performs poorly with headphones plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 21MP camera produces excellent daytime images though it has some focus issues. Low light photography is not its forte (to put it mildly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Daylight 4K video quality is perhaps the best we've seen, the level of detail is unrivaled by today's flagships. 1080p videos are good too, but not quite as spectacular.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>8MP selfie camera resolves a lot of detail but struggles with achieving the correct white balance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Jade Primo has been a long time in the making and by the looks of it, units will finally be shipping at the end of April. More than six months since its announcement, the hardware doesn't sound top notch anymore, but the smartphone did put up a very convincing performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life turned out surprisingly okay, given the average battery capacity. It's not record-breaking by any stretch, but it's acceptable, and downright excellent in video playback though we don't see binge-watching TV series on the Primo like a top priority of its target group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They could use its camera, though, and be delighted with it, as long as there's plenty of light. Daytime still images come out great, and 4K videos are simply exceptional. Not so in low light, where the output is plagued by noise and the image quality is on the other end of the spectrum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user experience isn't the best either, and the camera app isn't the only thing that keeps you waiting, but that seems to be a universal Windows Mobile issue (or who knows, maybe a feature). Another one of those is the app and games selection, which may constantly be expanding, but it doesn't seem likely that it'll ever catch up with competing ecosystems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most obvious competitors to the Liquid Jade Primo are Microsoft's own Lumia 950 and 950 XL. Display size is the main differentiator, and both QHD Lumias are also more pixel dense than the Acer's FullHD screen. The XL's battery life is better than the other two overall, and the Primo sits in the middle in this respect too. Both have similarly great cameras as Acer's phone, but neither quite matches its 4K video capture. But then, the smaller Lumia 950 is considerably cheaper than the Primo, while the XL is not all that more expensive, so if you're going Windows, you may as well stick to Microsoft's own for the best possible support down the road and some extra proprietary apps and extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HP Elite X3 carries a bold promise, but it's still a few months away from availability. It's got a more powerful Snapdragon 820 chipset, a 6-inch QHD display, and a huge battery. It all looks good on paper, but we're yet to see a production-level device in action. Price is also a mystery at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That just about exhausts your options in the Windows world, but you have plenty more running Android. 5.5 inches and Snapdragon 808 sounds a lot like the LG G4, which retails at about two-thirds of the Primo's asking price. Another great camera, arguably better overall, is slightly in LG's favor, as is the removable battery, though the actual battery life isn't exemplary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X Style (or Pure if you're in the US) is another viable option. Again substantially cheaper than the Primo, the X Style comes with a slightly larger higher-res display, likely the same camera sensor, and plenty of customization options. The inferior battery life in the tests that require the screen to be on doesn't sound that good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) matches the Primo for display size and diagonal, but not necessarily power. Its camera, good as it may be, is not up to the Primo's standards, but battery life is a lot better, and with the A7 you'd also be saving a few bucks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We finally get a compelling alternative to the Windows 10 smartphones coming out of Redmond. The Acer Liquid Jade Primo will start shipping later this month and it has a camera that excels in daylight, a battery life you can live with, and Continuum if you can find a use case for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But priced as it is, the Jade Primo would have a hard time competing with even last year's flagships, most of which have a similar or even superior hardware. So while it doesn't look to be among the best of deals today, it could have very well been truly a Primo had it been launched last September. Of course, a sharp drop in pricing may turn the odds in its favor so we'll most definitely keep an eye on this one in the months to come.</paragraph>
