			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In Samsung's playbook, a mini version of the top smartphone is typically the first new addition to a flagship's fleet. Sticking close to a proven formula, the Galaxy S4 mini is a downsized and down-priced edition, but one that certainly wants to live its own life instead of just being the poor man's S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other flavors of the flagship - the Galaxy S4 Active and the Galaxy S4 Zoom - are more or less niche versions, while the S4 mini should probably have broader appeal. Some of the top end features are obviously missing, both hardware and software wise, but it's a package that has plenty to offer to users who don't necessarily have to have the latest technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung decided to stick to Super AMOLED for the new 4.3-inch display, but lowered the resolution to qHD (540 x 960 px). The chipset that powers the Galaxy S4 mini is Qualcomm's latest midrange offering - the Snapdragon 400 - with a dual-core 1.7GHz Krait processor and Adreno 305, which is the low-end member of the latest generation of graphic chips integrated into Snapdragon SoCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera has also been downgraded - but 8MP of resolution is actually nothing to frown at. Some of the premium shot modes are missing, but it's still a very capable shooter, with HDR, panoramas, photos with audio, etc. And it does 1080p videos of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Galaxy S4 mini is powered by the same software combo as the flagship: Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and the latest TouchWiz UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the Galaxy S4 mini lacks some of the sensors, the cool Air Gestures are not enabled. The Air View is not an option either, along with the Multi-View split screen feature. What the Galaxy S4 mini offers over the flagship S4 is an FM radio, a feature that the intended market is likely to appreciate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Galaxy S4 mini copies the original design to a T, but has to do without some of the premium features and last-gen hardware of its greater sibling. It's a compact and more affordable alternative - and aiming to be one that many people end up buying. Let's see what its chances are.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini comes in a very compact box, in line with the recent trend of using recycled paper and soy-ink print for the packaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accessories in the bundle are nothing out of the usual. The A/C adapter, to be used with the supplied microUSB cable, are joined by a pair of earphones. All of the above are painted white.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S4 mini 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini measures 124.6 x 61.3 x 8.9 mm, and it's actually surprisingly smaller than the flagship. More importantly though, the S4 mini is nearly the same size as a Galaxy S III mini, thinner at that, while offering a bigger screen of higher-resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is a downsized replica of the flagship only it has much less imposing physique. Keeping the same styling and finish as the top product in the lineup was obviously a conscious choice - the aura of the flagship is probably expected to be a major sales driver. Some kind of design accent to bolster the mini's character may've made sense though, we think. Particularly when you consider how played out the design has become at this point - it's only undergone a small refresh since the Galaxy S III came around and we've seen in on a few dozen devices already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's take a good look at the handset. Bellow the display you get the usual three keys: capacitive Menu and Back buttons and a regular press Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we have the earpiece, as well as the usual ambient light and proximity sensors. What's missing is the Air gesture sensor - the mini version doesn't have that feature. There's a 1.9 megapixel front-facing camera for video-calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is where the volume rocker is located.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side there's only a power key. Considering the original Galaxy S4 hasn't got a dedicated camera key, we couldn't possibly expect to find one here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy S4 features the 3.5mm audio jack, the secondary microphone and the IR blaster that allows you to use the smartphone as a remote control for your home appliances. There's also a feature-rich remote control app, so the functionality is available right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port resides alongside the primary microphone at the bottom and is used for both data connections and charging. There's no USB host and MHL support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini sports an 8MP camera, capable of recording 1080p video, and a LED flash. The loudspeaker grille is in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The package is powered by a 1900mAh battery. The microSD card slot and the microSIM compartment are located under the battery itself, so hot-swap is not an option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is really easy to handle with its curved back fitting nicely in the palm of your hand. Given the friendlier, compact size, the slippery finish is a lot less of an issue than it was in the bigger Galaxy S4. Single-handed operation is very comfortable and the AMOLED screen is a pleasure to look at, both indoors and outdoors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini uses a 4.3" Super AMOLED screen of qHD resolution (960 x 540 pixels). The pixel density clocks in at 256ppi, which is quite good, and what's even better is that it's an RGB matrix, not a Pentile screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It uses a layout similar to that of the Galaxy Note II with three subpixels per pixel, where the blue sub-pixel is twice as large as the red and green ones. That's a clever way to extend the life of the screen, without sacrificing anything in terms of sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can find sharper 720p screens in these parts of the market now, but you'll need to live without the benefits of the AMOLED technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the Galaxy S4 mini display offers above average image quality for a midrange device. Colors a punchy, blacks are as deep as AMOLED gets them and the viewing angles are extremely wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is very good and pretty close to the Galaxy S4 and other Galaxy flagship scores.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our battery test showed that the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini offers remarkable endurance on the individual tasks in our battery life test, but the higher than average drain in stand-by mode prevented it from getting an impressive overall endurance rating. Even so it did more than well and if Samsung improves the stand-by time with future firmware updates, it might be one of the longest-lasting smartphones on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 54h rating means you can expect the phone to typically last this amount of time on a single charge if you stick to our test regiment of using the phone for an hour of calling, an hour of video watching and an hour of web browsing a day and then leaving it on stand-by during the rest of the time. Of course, your mileage will vary depending on your usage pattern and network environment but still, it's our standardized way of producing comparable results across smartphones by different manufacturers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Galaxy S4 with a few features missing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini has the same software version as the original Galaxy S4. Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean is skinned with TouchWiz Nature UX and some - but not all - of the special treats of the Galaxy S4 are available here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini features the new lockscreen widgets introduced with Android 4.2, though Samsung fiddled with them a bit. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message, beautiful images pulled from TripAdvisor providing the background (you can turn that off).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water ripples have been replaced by a lens flare effect though you can switch back to the old one or disable it altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in unskinned Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen and the notification area are identical to what you get in the original Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five (or eight in landscape mode) toggles at the top of the notification area to quickly enable and disable features. There are more than you can see, of course - swipe to reveal the rest. Or you can tap the new button that displays a grid of all the shortcuts, 20 in total. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can hide this slider to get more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them, such as "Call back" or "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go back to when you press the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changed really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and some shortcuts can be hidden (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders. Widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a discreet but useful change to the way you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen - there's a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can judge how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung tweaked the Settings screen to use a tabbed interface. There's four of them - Connection, My device, Accounts and More. You can find the relevant features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the My device tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest iteration of TouchWiz is highly customizable as usual, and offers rich functionality. Some of the flagship-worthy features are missing in the Galaxy S4 mini - Air gestures and Air view are not a huge deal-breaker in our view, but the absence of Multi-window mode that lets you run two apps side by side on the screen was a disappointment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough the pre-release sample of the Galaxy S4 mini we had for the preview did pack both Air gestures and Air view, but the functionality has been dropped now. Obviously, Samsung didn't feel the performance of the two features was up to scratch here and it decided to remove them in the final version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Out of the so-called Smart Screen package, you do get Smart Stay, which won't let the screen go blank as long as the front cam can detect you looking at it. Smart rotation is absent though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is powered by the Snapdragon 400, which has two Krait cores clocked at 1.7GHz. This is the older-generation but should be more than capable of running Jelly Bean and TouchWiz smoothly on a qHD screen. The Galaxy S4 mini packs 1.5GB of RAM, which enables quite good multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-threaded performance is excellent and the Krait cores are always in the top of our chart only beaten by the newer Krait 300 processors. Multi-threaded performance is not that great, but on par or better than 2012 flagships.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The system-wide benchmark Quadrant saw the Galaxy S4 mini pop in the middle of the chart. AnTuTu was recently updated and we've only tested quad-core devices since, so the last place isn't too bad news for the S4 mini. In fact its close proximity to those ahead of it is very encouraging.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>GLBenchmark 2.5 and 2.7 were run in 1080p offscreen mode ? four times the physical resolution of the screen. If nothing else, this test shows the S4 mini packs about as much GPU power as the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Epic Citadel, which runs at screen resolution, shows that the GPU is quite capable of handling qHD gaming. The 54+fps is a reasonably high result, although it shows the smartphone isn't able to maintain 60fps graphics at all times, unlike many of the flagships out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Just as expected, the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini did impressively well in our web browsing test. Both JavaScript performance (SunSpider) and HTML5 rendering (BrowserMark 2) rival current flagships. Samsung has nicely tuned the JavaScript engine of its smartphones and has also coached its devices to do well in synthetic tests, plus core-count doesn't really matter there.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini did about as expected in benchmark tests and it even punched above its weight in some of them. More importantly though it has excellent real life performance ? there were no system hiccups, app loading times are pretty much non-existent, the Android OS runs as fluid as possible and most of the heavy tasks are an easy job for the qHD Galaxy S4 mini.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and is preloaded on the Galaxy S4 mini. S Voice can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, launch apps, play music, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual phone and it has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy S4 mini to answer a call, snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The problem with S Voice is that it is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, being a Jelly Bean smartphone, the S4 mini also comes with Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget for the homescreen or lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on the Galaxy S4 mini packs a wide range of features. Four tabs on top provide access to the Phone app, Groups, Contacts and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can move contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A call or a message to someone can be initiated directly from the contact list with a right and left swipes respectively, which is really handy on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contacts feature, upon a tap on the contact picture, shows a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, video call, text or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all the details available. Information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. You can use the back button to go to the full contact list, or tap in the top left corner, just like in vanilla Android. The top right corner has shortcuts to contact editing and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the phone book finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt you to join them. Furthermore, there are a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like the previous version of TouchWiz, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reject list blocks certain numbers from calling you, even just prefixes (you can block international callers). It works great with preset numbers and you can also bar unknown numbers. There are third party blacklist apps in the Play Store but it's nice to have this out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a specific vibration pattern as an incoming call alert, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too. You can also assign a custom vibration to specific contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the Galaxy S4 mini is really something. It's almost too advanced for some users but its interface is simple enough so you can only use the features you need. Once you find your feet around you will appreciate having cool extras like Direct Call and selective call barring, which stock and most other forms of Android lack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony offers native video calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini offers top notch in-call audio and managed to hold onto reception with ease. Earpiece volume is great and Samsung has even gone as far as adding an in-call equalizer, which does wonders if you want an even louder experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Native video calls are available as well, right in the phone app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini has Smart Dial, which searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest of the matches (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Direct Call is available too and lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts or reading/composing a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is at hand and taken care of by the S Voice service, which activates on a double tap of the home button. All you need to say is "Hi Galaxy" and speak your command (e.g. "call Dexter"). It takes a while to process voice commands but it has more uses than other voice-recognition apps for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off when you hold it next to your ear during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another person to the conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini's loudspeaker scored an Average mark, so it might be a good idea to check periodically your phone for missed events. You can find more about the testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great messaging capabilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: a list of all your messages organized into threads with a Compose message button in the top right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a right swipe starts a call, while a left swipe starts a new message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard of the Galaxy S4 mini doesn't have an additional numeric row above the letter keys because of the small screen and lower resolution. The layout is pretty much the same as what we used to see in the third generation of Galaxies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Swype-like mode which tracks your finger and guesses the word you're trying to type. This feature works great but has limited language support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional input methods include a regular numpad and Voice, which can work even offline if you've downloaded the required language files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has left a lot of room for customizing your messaging experience. You can choose from different speech bubble patterns and background, and can use the volume keys to increase or decrease the font in conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're composing a new message you can use the Translate option to translate it into another language. The same goes for messages you've received. This feature probably won't see much use but it's there you ever need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What will come in good use, however, is the Direct call (again) feature. When you are reading a message from someone, their number will be automatically dialed by just lifting the handset up to your face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the dialer, the Messaging app has built-in spam filter. You can block some numbers (or all unknown numbers) and even add specific phrases to be blocked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Gmail app now displays contact images in mails. If an email has multiple recipients, they're shown in a grid similar to the Hangouts app. If there is no contact image, it just shows the first letter of the sender against a color background. You can disable sender images in the email app if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail v4.5 also includes the four new inbox options. You can have your mail sorted by Primary, Social, Promotions and Updates as you can on Gmail web, which makes it easy to keep track of your mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Email app can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts, the ex-GTalk client, handles the Instant Messaging department. The new app offers group video chats, emojis, photo exchange, history sync across multiple devices, and a completely new UI design. It's available on iOS as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Feature-rich gallery but no air view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy S4 mini is quite similar to what you get on the regular S4 except for the air view option. It can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. There is no spiral view here. You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing an album's contents, a right swipe will reveal a bar with the rest of the albums available. In this mode you can browse images in a split-screen mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a press and hold on an image, the gallery gives you the option to select multiple images, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos on the Galaxy S4 mini is a pleasant experience. The screen is ample and Super AMOLED treats you to very pleasant colors. The gallery naturally supports full-res images. You can enable the Adobe RGB screen mode for accurate color rendering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, with a line of small thumbnails below displaying all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily edit photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also put down a note over the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery supports highly customizable slideshows too, with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy S4 mini is the same as the one on the Galaxy S4. It is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC, Wave, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album, Playlist, etc. but there's also Folder support (which is more often found on third party players) - it's quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on so many other players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music square is quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and lets you build playlists matching your mood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini can also search for content on third party players like PCs on the same network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one with 7 bands) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options: a timeline, play/pause and skip controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, an AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini has a couple of features that will further improve your listening experience. One is Smart Sound, which equalizes the volume between tracks. The other is Adapt Sound - an audio calibration tool that tries to combine the most comfortable highs and lows for the best audio in calls and music. This way the phone can map the capacity of your specific headset and fine-tune its output for optimal sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the calibration is complete, the Galaxy S4 mini shows you the kind of gain you're receiving by keeping Adapt Sound on.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The video player on the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini has the last watched video on top for quick access. There are two tabs below it - personal (showing you the videos on your local storage) and Nearby devices, which shows the PCs and players on your local Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All thumbnails are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate and generating those previews takes a couple of minutes the first time around, but it's still an awesome preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is enabled too - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans all subtitles, so the file doesn't even have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big disappointment here is the relatively poor video codec support. It plays XviD, MP4 and MKV files of up to 1080p resolution, but DivX is not supported. AC3 and DTS sound do not work either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS, broadcast recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini is the only smartphone from the S4 lineup that is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 12 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it acts as the antenna. You can record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Solid audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini performed excellently in the first part of our traditional audio quality test, posting great scores all over the field and garnishing them with a decent (if unspectacular) volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones, but it is barely noticeable outside of dedicated audio labs. The stereo crosstalk rises notably, but that's about it - the rest of the readings remain unchanged..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>An 8MP shooter with a host of cool features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini comes with an 8MP main camera and a 2MP front-facer, but unlike its bigger brother, the smartphone can't use both at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is based on the Galaxy Camera interface. The viewfinder handles both still and video capture, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution - if you're shooting full resolution 8MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings are found in two places. The first is the Mode button under the shutter key. It brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops the text but is faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper left corner, there are a couple of quick settings plus an arrow to reveal more options. As for the different camera modes, it's a collection of some of the best camera features currently available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arrow at the bottom of the screen brings up a row of color effects. Each effect gets a live preview, so you can see what the particular scene will look like with it. There's a download button so you can grab more effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more settings in the top left corner, but they won't be very often used. Still, there a number of interesting options here like having the volume rocker act as a still shutter key, a video shutter key or a zoom lever. The HDR mode (Rich Tone) can be set to save a normal and an HDR photo or just the HDR one. Another interesting option is contextual file names - the Galaxy S4 mini will name photos with your location (the GPS needs to be on for this to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go over the different modes. There are standard modes like Rich Tone (HDR), Panorama, Night and Sports. Panoramas are nice, they do a full 360° circle, but the resolution is not that impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound &amp; shot captures a photo and records ambient sound. It sounds pretty cool - for example, you can hear the sea gulls in a beach photo or the roar of car engines at a race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos have a lot of fine detail and little noise. Colors are generally quite close to reality with only slightly oversaturation to be noted at times. White balance is halfway between neutral and cold. We noticed that the Galaxy S4 mini preserves detail in the shadows, sometimes at the cost of detail in the highlights. You can use the HDR mode to remedy this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are some HDR samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, here is a 360 panorama sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini camera is very much the same as the cameras on last year's flagships. You can also pit it against the 13MP camera of the regular Galaxy S4 and the water-resistant Sony Xperia Z using the upscale/downscale options in our Photo compare tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great 1080p video capturing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini stores videos in MP4 files with a bitrate of 17Mbps on average. Stereo audio is recorded at 128Kbps and a sampling rate of 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available before and during video recording and you can switch back to continuous autofocus if you prefer. You can capture 6MP (16:9) photos during recording as well, but images come out with very different image processing from what you get from the still camera - the contrast and saturations are boosted way up and there's a good deal of overshaprening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured with the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini have a good level of fine detail and little noise. Colors and white balance are similar to those in still images, overall accurate but slightly oversaturated (especially in the green channel). The continuous autofocus triggered a bit too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a FullHD video sample we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is also an untouched video sample from the Galaxy S4 mini you can download - 1080p @ 30fps(0:07s, 15.4MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-round connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini starts off with the basics - quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G. An LTE-variant of the device is also be available in select markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S4 mini uses Bluetooth 4.0 alongside Wi-Fi support which includes a/b/g/n with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini allows you to share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the S4 and other later-generation S devices back-to-back. You can share with other NFC devices as well, but functionality is limited to what is provided by the stock Android Beam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare DLNA functionality, which used to be a standalone application, is now more tightly integrated into the respective Samsung applications. To share or access content from nearby DLNA-enabled devices, you do this directly from the My Video app and the Music Player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an IR-port, which allows you to control various TV's and other devices using Samsung's WatchON app, which we'll cover later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the USB 2.0 port. That handles data connectivity with a computer, but unlike the big Galaxy S4 lacks MHL and USB OTG support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android browser and Google Chrome on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini comes with two excellent web browsers - the stock Jelly Bean edition and Google Chrome. The stock browser UI is quite minimalistic - you get the URL bar with shortcuts to tabs and settings, and that's that. Hitting the Settings key reveals the rest of the controls - everything from searching on the page, saving to bookmarks to useful options like bypassing mobile sites, saving a page for offline reading and sharing a page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for plug-ins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which lets you surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. The brightness and colors option gives you four different presets to adjust the display according to your preferences. Automatic brightness is an option too, and works only within the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no lab settings and you can't enable Quick Controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer, you can use the other preinstalled browser, Chrome, instead. It offers excellent cross-platform sync capabilities, and at times it seems faster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini features a wide array of advanced features and applications that really help it stand out from other smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the coolest apps is called Group Play. It shares various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room, but unlike DLNA it's interactive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One use case is to play a music track on the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini and use multiple phones as speakers. You can pick the role of each phone (e.g. left channel, right) all the way up to surround sound. This way you can control the music from one phone but use the loudspeakers of all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the other phones will need to support Group Play - the phones communicate over Wi-Fi (your Galaxy S4 mini becomes a hotspot that others connect to) and the pairing is done via NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More useful are the options to share a picture or a document - you can have the same picture appear on everyone's phone and you can draw over it if you need to highlight a certain element of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, perhaps the coolest feature of Group Play is that it allows for multiplayer games to be played on several phones simultaneously. Of course, only supported games work - there weren't any games preloaded on our unit but you can grab some from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Samsung Link, another way to share content between devices. Unlike Group Play, Samsung Link is intended for just your devices - you can link the phone to a computer that is synced with Dropbox, SkyDrive or SugarSync and remotely access content on that device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator will help travelers - it can translate between two languages using either typed text or speech recognition. It can read out the resulting translation too, if you don't think your Korean accent can cut it. S Translator supports all the widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and, of course, Korean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Story Album can be really helpful in organizing your photos. After a shooting session it will prompt you to group all the new photos into an album. Albums can be created based on location, the people in the photo and when the shot was taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung WatchON is the primary app used with the built-in IR emitter on the top of the phone. The app starts out by asking your zip code and pulls up a number of TV service providers in that area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is so that the app can show you a TV guide with shows currently on or upcoming on the channels offered by the service provider. You can read a description of the show, check out its popularity in up/down votes (and vote yourself, of course). You can also set reminders for shows you don't want to miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the key element of the app is the IR remote control functionality. The app can control TVs, DVD and Blu-ray players and streaming media players. Devices are organized by rooms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really liked about the app is that it knows some home setups are messy - some let you change channels with the TV remote, others require you to use the set-top box remote for that. Same for the audio, you might be using the TV to output the sound or an AV receiver. The app will ask about your setup and present a unified remote control interface even if you have multiple hardware remotes to control all the devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Health is Samsung's home-brewed health and fitness tracking application. It didn't come pre-installed on our Galaxy S4 mini, but it is available for download in the Samsung Apps repository (region dependent). It starts off by getting you to create a profile which includes all your vital statistics, such as age/weight/gender and level of activity, plus your calorie consumption goals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers a pleasant-looking interface and has walking, exercise, and fitness trackers. It will monitor environmental influences too, such as temperature. S Health also supports a number of optional accessories, which let it give even more detailed status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Galaxy S4 mini comes preloaded with a special "Samsung edition" of the TripAdvisor app. Besides the ability to have rotating lockscreen images, the Samsung-specific version of the app allows you to login with your Samsung account, use the S Travel widget for a quick peek at certain popular travel destinations, as well as automatically add relevant travel information to your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the app lets you find interesting things to do if you're in a new city, as well as hotels, restaurants and even flight information. Most locations have reviews posted by other TripAdvisor users, so you can quickly see if a place is worth it or not.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Office Viewer pre-installed, no editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini gives you only the Polaris Office viewer functionality, instead of the full-fledged editor. The viewer does not show up in your app drawer, but instead only opens when you select the relevant document from the My Files app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, you can view most document types, including PowerPoint, Word, Excel as well as PDF. It can present the document as is or reflow the text to fit on the screen. There's also a text to speech option, so the phone can read the doc out loud (it will also offer to install a better TTS engine, which weighs in at about 100MB).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Planner fills the role of your calendar app, and can be viewed by Day, Week, Month or Year, or by a list of all your upcoming tasks or events. The small squares for each date give only limited info on the events for the day, but thanks to Air View you can point to a day to read the full description of events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. There's also a World clock, stopwatch, and timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've been familiar with the S Memo app ever since its debut on the Galaxy Note, and its functionality remains more or less the same. It allows you to create notes either via a virtual keyboard or simply by doodling with your finger. Samsung even sell a special display-friendly ball pen for enthusiasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files is Samsung's universal file manager that comes pre-installed on every Galaxy we've met so far. It offers all you need in a file explorer: multiple selection, cut, copy, paste, create folders, etc. The app is launched automatically when you hook up a USB mass storage device (a USB drive, another phone an SD card etc), which we find to be a nice touch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps Navigation gives you the most out of GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about three minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Google has recently upgraded the Maps app (v7.0) with new user interface, but its functionality is the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play, Samsung Apps and Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Apps features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far lower number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a store too for books and games through Samsung Hub. The Book store allows a preview of the first few pages of a book. You can read book reviews and synopses, author bios and search for more books by the same author.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A smaller version of the current flagship makes all kinds of sense. More compact and easier to handle, and - at the end of the day - more affordable, is what many people will gladly consider. The fact that a year ago the Galaxy Mini S III turned out to be a mild disappointment doesn't mean there's something wrong with the mini formula. Not if rumors of an HTC One mini are anything to go by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Galaxy S4 mini is our main story today and, as usual, we're trying to point out what it gets right and where it could've done better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, it's a mini version and the compact, lightweight package sounds like good news for people who are less than impressed by the idea of carrying a five-incher. A high-res display - well, close enough at least - with 720p screens around, qHD isn't the best you can get but still looking reasonably sharp on a 4.3" diagonal. And AMOLED at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if this is bluntly the budget-friendly alternative, the hardware must be capable of ensuring fluid, lag-free handling equal to that of the flagship and the S4 mini has no trouble delivering there. Good stills and video are among the last things users are willing to compromise on and the 8MP camera doesn't disappoint either. The software version is important too and the latest Android and TouchWiz are the combo you get with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far, so good. But there're things on the wrong side of the balance sheet too. Inevitable in packages like the Galaxy S4 mini. The Air View and Air Gestures were the first things to get the axe. Multi-window didn't make the cut either. Smart scroll and smart pause are missing too, but Smart Stay could be a consolation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design being an exact replica of the bigger S4 is something we're not completely convinced by either. True, Samsung wanted to use the flagship's momentum but a little personal touch to set the mini apart instead of using the same played out shape over and over again could've done wonders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, design is a subjective matter and not everyone needs all those gestures and fancy features, especially when they get a solid display and above average camera performance, LTE and NFC connectivity, and the latest Android OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini has just hit the shelves and currently it costs around &#x20ac;380 - maybe not exactly the price that will drive crowds to the stores - in some markets the original S4 can be had for less than a hundred more. This isn't a particularly comfortable margin for the mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the downsized version is just about launching and the fact that the other modified versions of the flagship are fetching even higher prices may help. That said, we don't think the Galaxy S4 zoom or the Active are any sort of competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP sounds more like it. It offers a slightly bigger 720p display, more GPU power, while the processor and imaging capabilities are largely on par. The Xperia SP runs on Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, which isn't ideal, but Sony's skin is quite minimalist compared to TouchWiz, which may actually be a good thing for some. The Xperia SP is slightly cheaper and looks better, but it's much bigger too, so it's mostly about picking your priorities when choosing between those two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia SP</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone 8-powered Nokia Lumia 820 is a viable alternative that's dirt cheap compared to the S4 mini. Of course it's got a slightly less powerful chipset ticking inside and only a WVGA AMOLED screen but the free offline-available SatNav and office package may as well tip the scales in its favor for those that aren't worried by the apps that WP8 still misses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 820</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact that even the Lumia 920 is currently slightly cheaper is a bit of bad news for the Galaxy S4 mini - provided of course that Android is not an absolute must. LTE, the HD screen and the PureView camera tech are very tempting specs on top of the other value-adding Microsoft and Nokia features. It's a great offer, especially for the camera buffs, but the sheer size and weight may be a major turn-off, which is something for the mini to exploit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 920</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is doing most things right. It's probably not everyone's dream version of a flagship in miniature but definitely closer than the S III mini got last year. It's by no means a super-mini but one that can be a pleasant ride.</paragraph>
