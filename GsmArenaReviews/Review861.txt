			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony just unveiled three new Android-powered devices - two Z2s, the Xperia Z2 smartphone flagship and Xperia Tablet Z2, plus the midrange Xperia M2. The Z2's are water-resistant, in the tradition of the Z line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2, as expected, boasts a slightly bigger screen, slightly faster chipset and, at long last, 4K video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest change in the Xperia Z2 Tablet is the new chipset - Snapdragon 800 with 3GB RAM, up from an S4 Pro. The new tablet also has a higher water resistance rating and is even thinner and lighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Xperia M2, a mid-range 4.8" Android phone. It's not water-resistant like its siblings, but still has the specs to go after the Moto G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: the video demos are up!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 is Sony's first flagship device of 2014. We received a quick demo of the smartphone and we also spent time with it ourselves:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 takes after the Z1 (which is to say it looks hot), but it has a larger screen ? a 5.2" Triluminos display. The display has 1080p resolution, despite all the rumors of QHD screens at the MWC. The sharpness is great though and Sony has used the same tech for the screen as it does for its TVs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features a 20.7MP Exmor RS sensor and Sony has finally enabled 4K video recording @ 30fps (aka 2160p). You can use digital zoom during video recording, but we've yet to see if it's as good as the Note 3's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some new camera modes include 120fps slow-motion (at 720p resolution) and Background Defocus, and Vine is pre-installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat with Sony's customizations, which have gotten a reputation of minimal but functional changes to Android. More interestingly, Sony uses Qualcomm's brand new Snapdragon 801 chipset ? an improved version of the already fast 800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Z phones have never been the loudest round (the price to pay for water-proofing), but the Xperia Z2 features stereo speakers, so it might be better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony continues to use its long process of carving a thin, light chassis out of a single slab of aluminum. The Xperia Z2 is 12g lighter than its predecessor. Here are the steps of the process:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The larger screen led to a slight increase in size but that's only in the vertical dimension, the Xperia Z2 is 2.4mm taller than the Z1, but a hair narrower and thinner. As before, the body has IP58 certification, so it can go as deep as 1.5m under water for half an hour..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So can other Sony products, there was an impressive presentation on that too:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 comes with 16GB of built-in storage and a microSD card slot. The slots and ports are covered by flaps to prevent water damage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of ports, the microUSB 2.0 port features MHL and can output 4K video - now all you need is a 4K TV to watch the videos you've shot in their full glory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia Z2 camera samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 camera follows the Z1 and Z1 Compact guidelines - 20.7MP Exmor RS sensor, 1/2.3" big, Sony G Lens (f/2.0, 27mm wide angle). We couldn't take the phone outside, but we still captured a sample photo:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we recorded a 4K video too. Here it is uploaded to YouTube, but you can also download it to avoid the extra compression. Keep in mind that your computer and video player need to be able to handle 4K video. If not, at least you can view the YouTube video at 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia Z2 benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had just enough time with the Z2 to run several of our usual benchmarks - this is our first encounter with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, so we didn't know quite what to expect. The Xperia Z2 chipset is clocked at 2.3GHz and has 3GB of RAM, so it should do well against other flagships. It's worth pointing out the device is still a month away from store shelves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will repeat the benchmarks once we get more time with the Xperia Z2, but the GPU performance is quite impressive. .</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet is the successor of the popular Xperia Tablet Z. Just like the original, the Z2 Tablet is water and dust resistant. The enhanced water proofing means it can now survive 1.5-meter dives for as long as 30 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video overview of the Z2 Tablet:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet looks exactly like the Tablet Z - the OmniBalance design scales impressively well to tablet size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Z2 Tablet is powered by the Snapdragon 800 chipset with a 2.3GHz quad-core Krait 400 processor, Adreno 330 GPU and 3GB of RAM. It comes with an 8MP rear cam and a 2MP front-facer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the slate will be available in two flavors - Wi-Fi only and an LTE-capable model. It seems both versions will be offered with 16GB of internal storage, expandable via a microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the Xperia Z2 Tablet is a significant update over its predecessor, it does not look like such. Yes, Android 4.4 KitKat is lightning-fast, but the changes are only under the hood. And if it wasn't for the few different icons and premium apps (such as the OfficePro Suite), we wouldn't even know we are handling the new Z2 Tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the slate is a real pleasure to hold with very nice soft touch finish at the back. We've always considered the Tablet Z as one of the best looking tablets on the market and a year later we can safely say the same about its successor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may not be a major upgrade, but a worthy one for sure. Now if you already have the original Tablet Z, you will be getting all the same software enchantments with the upcoming KitKat upgrade. We guess that's at least another year that you can hold on to your gadget. But the Xperia Z2 Tablet is an easy one to recommend to newcomers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia M2 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, the Xperia M2 is the leaked Xperia G that was supposed to challenge the Moto G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick presentation of the Xperia M2:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M2 has the traditional OmniBalance styling and a roomy 4.8" screen. At qHD (540 x 960) resolution, this makes a relatively low 229ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M2 is a full centimeter taller and half a centimeter wider than the 4.5" Moto G. The Sony is three millimeters thinner though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the screen of the M2 is not too impressive, the Xperia has a number of advantages over the Moto G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For one, the camera on the back is an 8MP unit with an Exmor RS sensor and 1080p capture (vs. 5MP / 720p for the Moto). The camera also borrows the Background Defocus and Motiongraph features from the Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since those 1080p videos will quickly eat up the 8GB of built-in storage, the microSD card slot is welcome. The Xperia M2 also features a 2,300mAh battery, which Sony says is enough for 14 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more ? the Xperia M2 has a quad-core Snapdragon 400 chipset, which is similar to the Moto G's but supports LTE and NFC. Connectivity also includes MHL and Miracast for wired and wireless video output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M2 will launch in April on Android 4.3 Jelly Bean at $300 / ?220. The color options are identical to the Z2 flagship ? White, Black and Purple.</paragraph>
