			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The summer isn't always the best time to get a new smartphone. Most people have other things on their mind and even the makers are taking a break after a busy start of the season. CES, MWC and a couple of major one-off launches have filled in the blanks as far as flagships go. The next major event is IFA, a couple of months from now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, to buy or not to buy? This sounds like the right question right now but there's more than one way to look at it. The current season's flagships will only be getting cheaper from now until Christmas but the prices have at least somewhat settled after the post-launch euphoria.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last season's best have stepped down the food chain and their prices have responded accordingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the midrange, some fresh offers are joining, with post release's sales momentum just settled down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual for our shopping guides, this summer edition will be driven by price tag. We'll warm up with a look at the sub-?100 category first, and each chapter to follow will raise the bid. There's plenty on offer for every budget, taste and need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entry-level segment is where the picture is the most diverse - there are different shapes and sizes, camera specs and operating systems. As you move up the budget scale, you start stumbling upon former flagships, long past their glory days but with still enough to offer the right users. The expensive premium categories are growing thinner but we've tried to find the right picks in each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we strived for variety and value, it's important to note that we only listed phones of reasonably wide availability. Single carrier or single country phones did not make the cut. Of course, many phones didn't get a nod either as others were cheaper or better, or both. Check the final chapter for what was left out and why.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Under ?100<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Believe it or not, the under ?100 category has always been the most difficult. This is where the hidden gems are but amidst plenty of potential disappointments. Usually the people looking to get a new budget smartphone are either first-timers or really need a specific smart feature but can't afford to splash. Both types deserve a proper purchase, otherwise a poor choice can affect their whole perspective on smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?50 Alcatel Fire E keeps its place for yet another edition of our Buyer's guide. It's an incredibly affordable phone running on the newborn Firefox OS, which is good at making novice users comfortable. The specs are similar to the Moto E, you get a 4.5" IPS qHD display, a dual-core processor, a 5MP camera, 4GB of expandable storage, but half the RAM at 512MB. Don't you worry though, the Firefox OS can run perfectly fine on 512MB RAM as it was designed to manage with even less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And our personal favorite in this category, the Motorola Moto E, which you just can't go wrong with. It's a beautiful little gadget that manages to stay relevant more than a year since launch. The original Moto E is built around a 4.3" qHD display, with 256ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto E is powered by an entry-level Snapdragon 200 chip with a dual-core 1.2GHz processor, Adreno 302 GPU and 1GB of RAM. The latter has been a rarity among the KitKat phones of 2014 and a bright highlight into the Moto E key features. The hardware package is wrapping up with a 5MP rear cam and expandable 4GB storage. Oh, and there is a dual-SIM version as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best thing about the Moto E is it's already running the latest Android 5.1 Lollipop, a feat even an HTC One M9 can envy. The snappy vanilla Android, in our opinion, is better for newbies than any skinned Android out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 532 costs as much as a Moto E, but packs more punch under the hood. It has a 4" WVGA display and is powered by a quad-core 1.2GHz processor on 1GB of RAM. The Lumia 532 has 8GB expandable storage, a 5MP camera and dual-SIM flavor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8.1 is quite a treat and offers a plethora of free apps right out of the box. You get a complete office package, voice-guided navigation, pre-installed Skype, various camera apps, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tizen OS, which has been in development for quite a while, turned out quite a capable and lightweight mobile OS. The Samsung Z1 originally launched in just one market, but has expanded its reach since. Its specs are pretty basic - a 4" WVGA screen, a dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 768MB RAM, 4GB of expandable storage and a 3MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One particular reason for buying a Tizen phone is its native Android app support. The TouchWiz influences can be both pros and cons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Acer Liquid Z220 is now on sale for about ?95, which gets you a 4" WVGA display and a dual-core 1.2GHz processor with 1GB of RAM. It doubles the storage of the predecessorto 8GB, upgrades the main camera from 2MP to 5MP and introduces a 2MP front snapper for video chats. And the new Liquid Z220 runs on Android Lollipop. What an upgrade indeed!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're after a Lumia smartphone with a bigger screen, an extra ?25 on top of the Lumia 532 will get you the Lumia 535. It boasts a bigger 5" qHD IPS display, an autofocus 5MP camera, and a 5MP selfie camera, all powered by a bigger battery. You can opt for a dual-SIM model as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the ?99 Lenovo A6000 once again makes the sub-?100 category. It is the best equipped phone of the bunch with a 5" 720p IPS display, a 64-bit quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM, an 8MP camera and 8GB of expandable storage. It is also the cheapest LTE-enabled phone you can buy today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Lenovo A6000 is still available in just a few markets, but if you're lucky you may come across the Lenovo K3, which is the same device under a different name.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?100-?200<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ah, the most popular category comes next. The sweet spot for millions of smartphone buyers is between ?100 and ?200 and the competition is fierce. There is a good chance you may find your perfect match right here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 320 has seen a price drop since we last met and the current tag of about ?110 keeps it for another round in our guide. The 4.5" phone uses a FWVGA display, a quad-core 1.3GHz processor and a 5MP camera with 1080p video recording. Note that the North American version has only 512MB of RAM and omits an LED flash, compared to the European version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia E4g is one of the best value-for-money options. Sony has equipped the phone with a 4.7" qHD screen, there is a 64-bit 1.5GHz quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, a 5MP camera with 1080p recording and, of course, LTE connectivity. The phone runs Android KitKat but there is a good chance it will eventually receive Lollipop, given Sony's excellent track record this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can say the same about the second generation Moto E. Its specs are slightly different, yet still relevant. The Moto E 2nd Gen has a 4.5" IPS qHD display, a quad-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A53 processor, 1GB of RAM, 8 gigs of expandable storage, a 5MP camera, LTE connectivity and Android 5.1 Lollipop. Motorola's on-time firmware updates are the reason Moto E series has grown so popular.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there is an underpowered 3G model, which has the same specs as the original Moto E from 2014. It's cheaper and in some markets is sold as an updated version of the first-gen Moto E.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 2 is an excellent smartphone, if available where you are. The smartphone is built around a 4.7" 720p IPS display and runs on the 64-bit Snapdragon 410 with a quad-core 1.2GHz processor and 1GB of RAM. Its 8MP still camera is doing great and it's capable of recording 1080p videos. The handset has 8GB internal storage and supports LTE connectivity. For merely ?20 more you can get its enhanced version which doubles the RAM and storage, but its availability is rather spotty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 640 was released in quite a few flavors: 3G, 3G with Dual SIM, LTE and LTE with Dual SIM. At about ?140 you can get the regular 3G Dual SIM flavor. The Lumia 640 series come with a 5" 720p display, run on Snapdragon 400 with a quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM, there is 8 gigs of storage, a capable 8MP still camera and Windows Phone 8.1 soon to be updated to Windows 10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft and its Lumia smartphones have been targeting the lower midrange and they have become a popular choice for lots of people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Microsoft Lumia 640 is available in an XL version with a 5.7" display and a 13MP camera. It adds about ?50 to the regular Lumia 640's price tag, but you can still opt for a 3G Dual SIM, LTE and LTE Dual SIM models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like Xiaomi, the ZTE phones aren't available on sale everywhere, but if you can get one you won't be disappointed. The ?140 ZTE Blade Vec 4G is a good example. The 5" phone has an HD display and a quad-core processor, packs 8GB of storage, 1GB of RAM and there is either a 13MP or an 8MP camera, depending on the market. Android KitKat is in charge and the chance for it to get Lollipop is slim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Q5 is both for the fans of hardware QWERTY and native BlackBerry services. The company might be struggling with the hardware sales lately, but it is still one of the recognizable brands on the market and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Switching to Android or not, that's yet to be decided.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry OS has finally come to terms with touchscreen and even supports Android apps, so you can get the best of both worlds if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Q5 's key specs are hardly impressive: a 3.1" square 720p IPS display, a dated Snapdragon S4 Plus chip with a dual-core processor and 2GB of RAM, a 5MP camera with 1080p videos and LTE support. Those are enough to give you a hassle-free BlackBerry experience though. This is the cheapest Berry you can get, but it surely looks classy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 mini wouldn't have made this edition of the guide, had LG not announced a few days ago its Lollipop update. Released more than a year ago, its specs are still quite relevant: a 4.7" qHD display, Snapdragon 400 chipset with a quad-core CPU and 1GB RAM, an 8MP camera and LTE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 mini is among the first generation LG smartphones to use the trademark design with rear controls. Now with Android Lollipop, the LG G2 mini is quite tempting at about ?130.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like the idea of getting the latest Android updates as soon as they arrive, the Moto G series should be the right place to look for your next phone. The Motorola Moto G 4G offers LTE connectivity and a microSD slot in addition to the original specs - a 4.5" 720p display, a quad-core processor, a 5MP still camera and 8GB of expandable storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An extra ?30 will allow you to opt for the second generation of the Moto G. It promotes the display to 5", keeping the resolution, processor, RAM and storage. The other upgrade is the 8MP camera, but it still doesn't offer 1080p video recording. Oh, and the second-gen Moto G isn't LTE-enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you really need LTE and like Motorola, there is the ?195 Motorola Moto G 2nd Gen 4G, which adds LTE support to the Moto G 2nd Gen. Everything else is the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's keen to give its old phones the Lollipop treatment, which is why we can now suggest the Sony Xperia M2 Aqua. It has a 4.8" qHD display, runs on the old but decent Snapdragon 400 chip and has a rather unimpressive 8MP camera as we discovered in our review. But the phone looks good and is water and dust proof, which should be enough to get you interested. It's probably the cheapest water-proof handset out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>How does a triple-SIM phone sound? Those are extremely rare, but if you are tempted by the idea you should give the Acer Liquid E700 Trio a try. The E700 is a 5" smartphone with a 720p display, a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor, an 8MP camera and 3G connectivity. You can get it in 4GB flavor with 1GB RAM or 16GB model with 2GB of RAM. Both versions have a microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 730 and Lumia 735 are smaller than the Lumia 640 lineup but offer enhanced main and selfie cameras. The Lumia 73x series feature a 4.7" OLED 720p display with ClearBlack tech, run on Snapdragon 400 chips with 1GB of RAM and there is 8 gigs of expandable storage. The main camera has a 6.7MP sensor and ZEISS optics and produces great stills, while 5MP selfie cam is optimized for Skype video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3G Lumia 730, Lumia 730 Dual SIM and Lumia 735 with LTE are among the first on the waiting list to get Windows 10 this fall and their prices all revolve around ?160-?170.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone 2 ZE500CL is finally on sale across Europe. It offers a 5" IPS HD display, runs on Intel Atom Z2560 with a dual-core processor and capable GPU, there is 2GB of RAM and 16GB of inbuilt storage. The camera is 8MP with 1080p video recording, there is LTE connectivity and Android Lollipop makes it all sound even better. You can get it for about ?180, but its availability is still limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last recommendation in this category is the ?199 Huawei Honor 4X. Its availability is expanding, it comes with a 5.5" HD display, runs on an octa-core or a quad-core processor depending on the market, there is a 13MP camera, LTE connectivity and Android Lollipop with Emotion 3.0 UI. Other features worth mentioning are the dual SIM option and a 5MP selfie shooter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?200-?300<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The midrange category is crowded as usual and some of the options here are quite popular. We've tested quite a few of them and you can easily check their pros and cons in our in-depth reviews. The list below includes some retired flagships, which still deliver quite a punch and imaging performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We kick off with the Meizu m1 note. If you live in Europe, you can get it for about ?200, while those living in Asia can find it even cheaper. It has a 5.5" 1080p display, which uses an IGZO matrix, a type of LCD usually found on high-end devices, and a pixel density of over 400ppi, which was flagship grade a year ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m1 note offers a 13MP/1080p main camera and a 5MP front facer. The Meizu m1 note is a dual-SIM device, but the second compartment doubles as a microSD slot. So if you need more than the base 16GB or 32GB storage you'll have to settle for only temporary dual-SIM use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The growing popularity of the Android Lollipop-powered Alcatel Idol 3 duo is probably well deserved. The smaller Idol 3 (4.7) costs about ?220 and comes with a 4.7" 720p IPS display plus Snapdragon 410 chip (quad-core CPU, 1.5GB RAM, LTE). The camera specs are solid with a 13MP/1080p main unit and a 5MP selfie cam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some extra ?60 will get you the bigger Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) with a 5.5" IPS 1080p display and a more powerful Snapdragon 615 chipset with an octa-core processor and 2GB of RAM. The main camera stays at 13MP, while the front facer is promoted to 8MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap enters our guide for the first time, replacing the aging BlackBerry Z10. The Leap isn't a massive upgrade but hopes to to make a difference. The recently released device costs about ?230 and ups the display to 5", keeping the resolution at 720p. The chipset remains the same too, a Snapdragon S4 Plus with a dual-core Krait, Adreno 225 GPU and 2GB of RAM. The camera combo is untouched as well: 8MP/1080p rear and 2MP front. The 16GB expandable storage and LTE connectivity are intact, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS supports Android apps, you can use the Amazon App Store as well as a side-loaded Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro is frankly getting old, released early 2013, but that makes it pretty cheap - offering a good 5.5" 1080p screen, a Snapdragon 600 chipset (which compares quite favorably to S400 chips) and a 13MP camera with 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was updated to Android 4.4 KitKat and that may be its last stop (at least officially). Also, supplies may be running low, but if you find one, it's a good value for money deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the camera is the focus of your purchase, then you should check out the Lumia 830. Its price has settled at about ?240, which sounds like a bargain for a 5" IPS 720p display, a quad-core processor, 16GB of storage, LTE connectivity and a premium 10MP ZEISS camera with optical image stabilization and some PureView tech.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 830 has some metal on its body, aluminum trim on both the glass front and the polycarbonate back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another classic, the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is small, metal-clad, water-proof and powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, the bezels around the 4.3" screen make it bigger than it needs to be, but the Snapdragon 800 chipset makes it more powerful than most phones so far. The 20.7MP camera is a serious contender too, it matches the Xperia Z3 for stills though it lacks the 2160p video option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is good enough to compete with the Lumia 830. The Xperia Z1 Compact will be updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a bit more cash you can have the full-size Sony Xperia Z1 too. It upgrades the screen to 5" 1080p and has a bigger battery but other than that both phones are equals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M4 Aqua can dive just as deep (and wards off dust better), plus it has a big 5" 720p screen. It is already on sale for about ?250 and brings a 64-bit octa-core processor and Android 5.0 Lollipop. The camera department isn't quite as impressive, but still great with a 13MP/1080p main camera and 5MP/720p selfie camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The middle member of the Zenfone 2 trio, if available near you, sounds great on paper. The Asus Zenfone 2 ZE550ML uses a 5.5" 720p display, runs on a capable Intel Atom Z3560 with a quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM, there is 16GB expendable storage and LTE connectivity. The camera specs seem fine too: a 13MP/1080p rear and a 5MP selfie camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset runs on Android Lollipop, has a good looking Zen launcher and a selection of Asus pre-installed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retired flagships are becoming even more tempting and the 5.5" Oppo Find 7a is a good example. It has a 1080p screen and a Snapdragon 801 chipset with 2GB of RAM. It offers 2160p video recording and high-framerate modes like 1080p@60fps and 720p@120fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This phone is the hardware base for the OnePlus One. The offshoot company sold phones on an invite-only basis and while that's no longer the case, it has been plagued by some reliability issues. Not to mention the software drama with Cyanogen OS and the delay of the in-house Oxygen OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 packs a bigger 5.2" screen in a smaller body than the Xperia Z1. Like it, the G2 has a Snapdragon 800 chipset and the Lollipop update is already rolling out. The 13MP/1080p camera boasts optical stabilization. One big drawback is that there's no microSD card slot and the base storage is 16GB, so we've picked the 32GB option. At least it leaves you some room for downloading games and movies.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?300-?400<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is where the midrange collides with the high-end and the lines get blurred. After that it's an all-out war between phones that offer countless variations on a common theme: great cameras, metal frames, waterproofing and stereo speakers (few manage to check all these boxes at the same time though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel makes phones in every size segment, but the Hero 2 is the biggest. It has a 6" 1080p screen and a stylus, a 2GHz octa-core processor with 2GB of RAM ensuring smooth multitasking. The phone is a looker too, with thin bezels and a metal chassis.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It features a 13MP camera with optical stabilization and 1080p video capture, plus a 5MP selfie camera also capable of 1080p video recording. The Alcatel Hero 2 runs Android 4.4 KitKat and while it lacks the extensive multitasking add-ons of TouchWiz it can make a great budget alternative to the Galaxy Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 continues to skew the market being one of the cheapest phones with a QHD screen money can buy and its price is going down by the day. The thin bezels keep the size down, while the Snapdragon 801 chipset and 13MP OIS camera put extra pressure on 2014 flagships. The camera has "laser focus," which improves accuracy in low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG G3 is the phablet to buy if you want bang for the buck. The back is made out of quality plastic with a brushed metal finish and can be popped off to access the battery and microSD slot for extra flexibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Alpha is the result of Samsung trying to make a compact flagship. In a way it's a prototype of the Note 4, but at 6.7mm slim and 115g it still has a place on the market. The thin body also features a metal frame combined with faux perforated leather that is more premium than the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Alpha has either an Exynos 5 Octa or a Snapdragon 801 chipset. We tested the Exynos model, which offers great performance and managed to squeeze decent uptime out of the small 1,860mAh battery. The Home key is a fingerprint sensor, which enables PayPal transactions and Private mode, but it's the less-convenient swipe to scan kind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&#x422;he Alpha's 12MP camera produces great stills and does 2160p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z3 Compact will have an edge in a beauty contest with its sturdy plastic frame and glass back. It has a screen of almost the same size, 4.6" 720p, but the phone is smaller (if a bit thicker). True, it lacks the hardware Home key with a fingerprint sensor, but it makes up for it with stereo speakers on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's waterproof too, so it can go where the Alpha can't, plus Sony's 20.7MP camera promises higher resolution stills. While the quality doesn't quite live up to the megapixel count, the 2160p video is quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z3 uses the same Snapdragon 801 chipset as one of the Alpha?s versions, but has stellar battery life. As part of the Z-series, the phone is already receiving the Android 5.0 Lollipop update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X (2014) is not as camera-obsessed as the phones above but it takes better care of its looks. With a metal frame and a selection of genuine wood and leather backs, the phone is highly customizable via the Moto Maker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a large 5.2" AMOLED screen of 1080p resolution and is based on the Snapdragon 801 chipset. While not a cameraphone proper, the Moto Z does a good enough job with a 13MP unit that shoots 2160p video. You get stereo speakers on the front, plus some basic waterproofing - it will survive splashes, but not submersion. Without a microSD card slot though, the base 16GB version won't cut it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML deserves a spot bringing one of the most impressive flagship specs you'll see nowadays. It has a 5.5" IPS 1080p display and runs on a powerful Intel Atom chipset. You can opt for the quad-core 1.8GHz processor and 2GB RAM model or the more powerful version with a quad-core 2.3GHz CPU and 4 GB RAM. The rest of the specs including camera and connectivity are on par with the rest of the entries here - but regardless of the impressive horsepower, the Zenfone 2 can only do 1080p videos @30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get a Lollipop-running Zenfone 2 with either 16, 32 or 64GB storage, expandable via a microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal Oppo R7 made quite an impression recently - it's one of the best looking devices on the market, with a beautiful 5" 1080p AMOLED screen, enough power courtesy of the Snapdragon 615 chip and an average 13MP snapper for its ?350 price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 930 also has a 5" AMOLED screen and focuses on imaging and performance. The large 20MP sensor features PureView tech with optical stabilization and since the Denim update it records 2160p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5" 1080p AMOLED screen rivals Samsung's Super AMOLEDs and with ClearBlack tech it's clearly visible in the sun. It's the current Windows Phone flagship and will offer the premium W10 experience until Microsoft starts unleashing the new flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera shootout continues with the HTC Desire Eye, though this one is more interested in you than the scenery. It has a best-in-class 13MP selfie camera with its own dedicated LED flash. Most other phones in this category have just 2MP snappers. The main camera is a 13MP unit too, both record 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire Eye may not have a metal unibody like its One siblings - or the Xperia Z2 - but it does borrow their front-facing speakers and it?s IPX7 certified. It's powered by a Snapdragon 801 chipset with 2GB of RAM and is getting Android 5.0 Lollipop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 now costs as much as the Xperia Z3 Compact. It is seemingly a generation behind the Z3 Compact, but keep in mind' it's a Sony half-generation. It has a 5.2" IPS screen with 1080p resolution and stereo speakers and a metal frame. You don't get a choice of backs, just glass, but the Z2 has true waterproofing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is the Sony usual, a large 20.7MP sensor with 2160p video capture. The Xperia Z2 is powered by a Snapdragon 801 chipset with 3GB of RAM and will run Android 5.0 Lollipop in short order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 rounds off the waterproof shooters for this chapter. It has IP67 certification and a 16MP camera with 2160p video capture that has several advantages over the Galaxy Alpha?s camera (including phase detection AF).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a 5.1" 1080p Super AMOLED screen similar to the Lumia 930 and Moto X (2014), as well as a similar Snapdragon 801 chipset. It has a swipe-to-scan fingerprint sensor like the Galaxy Alpha and unlike the Galaxy S6 you get a replaceable battery and a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Believe it or not, the LG G Flex 2 price has almost halved since we met it last quarter. It now costs about ?390, which makes it our final suggestion in this chapter. It has a curved - a 5.5" P-OLED that makes the Flex2 more compact and manageable than its predecessor, higher resolution too - 1080p up from 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was the first device with a Snapdragon 810 chipset and launched with Android 5.0 Lollipop out of the box. It uses the rear button design of the LG G3, but the back has a special self-healing coating, which can heal away mild scratches in a matter of minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex also borrows the 13MP camera with OIS, laser autofocus and 2160p video capture of the LG G3 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basically, the LG G Flex 2 is a flagship of the current generation, one of the most powerful phones out there, and you can have it at a midrange price.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?400-?500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This chapter will be short but sweet with only two phablets that made the cut, just like the last time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX4 Pro boasts a 5.5" IPS screen that's actually above QHD resolution. It has borrowed the Exynos 5 Octa chipset from the Galaxy Alpha and the 20.7MP/2160p camera from the Xperia Z series (and adds a 5MP/1080p selfie camera). Then Meizu adds a fingerprint sensor, no swiping needed here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It sounds great so far, but the Flyme OS (based on KitKat) may not be to everyone's taste. The bigger problem is the storage though, no expansion and only 16GB as base.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 4 may be cool, but it's still pricy compared to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which is our entry in this price bracket. The 5.7" 1080p screen still looks quite good, the S Pen stylus works great and the 13MP camera records 2160p video. Add an attractive (if metal-free) design and you may be tempted to save the ?100 or so premium you need to pay for its successor. Keep in mind that stock is running out, replaced by the slightly different Galaxy Note 3 Neo, so if you like it, you should get it like yesterday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z3 technically falls into this price category too, though honestly we can't find enough improvement over the Xperia Z2 to justify the sizeable price gap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Over ?500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is where things get really serious and making compromises is absolutely unacceptable. Spending so much cash on a phone means you have to get the best of everything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?500 LG G4 is subtly curved - not as much as the Flex and not flexible either - and has a 5.5" screen of higher resolution, QHD. The optional leather back with decorative stitching makes for a rather unique look, a welcome alternative to the metal and glass of other flagships. We only worry about the leather's durability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the camera department is highly impressive, a 16MP sensor with optical stabilization and a wide f/1.8 aperture. It lets in 80% more light compared to the G3. And with manual controls plus RAW capture mode, LG makes a serious claim for one of the best smartphone cameras around. The selfie camera is great too, an 8MP/1080p shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single comparatively weak area is the chipset - the Snapdragon 808 has only two powerful Cortex-A57 cores to back the four low-power A53s. Worse, the Adreno 418 GPU will be under lots of pressure by the QHD resolution of the screen. LG moved to an IPS Quantum panel for improved color rendering and contrast over the G3. You get a removable battery and a microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S6 is a reset of Samsung's usual design with a glass frame and the Galaxy S6 edge is one of the best-looking devices on the market. It's price has dropped by some ?100 since May and now you can have it for about ?540.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's start with the base Samsung Galaxy S6, whose price tag is easier to swallow. The 5.1" Super AMOLED screen of QHD resolution is the highest quality display yet (beating even the Note 4) and Samsung went a long way to spruce up TouchWiz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16MP camera with OIS and 2160p video flexed its muscles in our four-way shootout, beating its sibling Galaxy devices. The no-swipe fingerprint sensor also works better than Samsung's previous attempts, but in a controversial move the company sealed the battery and dropped the microSD card slot. The waterproofing of the Galaxy S5 is gone too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 4's highlight is the 5.7" QHD Super AMOLED screen, surrounded by a metal frame. The Note 4 houses an S Pen stylus to boost the proprietary multitasking features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 4 offers great hardware under the hood, while the OIS-enabled 16MP camera turned out excellent in every key aspect. The selfie resolution is below average at 3.7MP, but we can live with that. A fingerprint sensor is on board too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last time around we passed on the YotaPhone 2 but we just can't ignore it now. Its price drop and expanded availability, plus the launch of a white flavor makes it very attractive. The front 5" AMOLED screen is great as is the rear 4.7" always-on e-ink display. We've played with this combo and we like it very much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YotaPhone 2 is slightly behind the current flagship specs but the Snapdragon 801 chip will nevertheless deliver blazing-fast performance on a 1080p display. Plus, we found the 8MP camera among the best in its class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YotaPhone was recently updated to Android Lollipop and the one of a kind dual-screen concept justifies the steep price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike Samsung, HTC kept its traditional design that goes back to the HTC One from 2013. It tweaked the design with a two-color-tone look and we were always fans of metal unibody phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC also recognized that the camera is an issue and grabbed a 20.7MP sensor capable of 2160p video. We were glad to see UltraPixel go (at least get moved to selfie camera duties), but the new shooter doesn't live up to Galaxy S6 or iPhone 6 standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the stereo speakers on the front are better than what either Sony or Motorola have to offer and the audio quality with headphones plugged in is perfect. The 5" 1080p screen is behind on resolution and is surrounded by chunky bezels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 810 chipset in the HTC One M9 got some negative coverage due to overheating concerns and while it does run hotter than the Galaxy S6 (which also warms up), it doesn't become an issue unless you really push the chipset beyond its limit. Again, the One M9 and Galaxy S6 rivalry is too turbulent to summarize so you can get the full picture in our head-to-head article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we are wrapping up with the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge. It's the prettier S6 sibling and its unique design is bound to draw the envy of even iPhone users. The screen's sides are not as curved as on the Galaxy Note Edge, but they are symmetrical, which looks better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything else in the hardware department is the same as the flat-screened S6, but the Galaxy S6 edge has some additional software features. A night clock, various notifications and some gestures use the curved screen and add some neat functionality though we wouldn't call it vital.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung normally exacts a ?100 premium on the S6 edge over the S6 with the same storage, but the Galaxy S6 prices seem to be falling faster. In many regions the Galaxy S6 edge is available only in 64GB and 128GB (skipping the 32GB option) without an additional price hike over a 32GB Galaxy S6, which evens out the price a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've probably noticed the iPhone's are missing in this chapter and the reason is very simple - Apple will be announcing its next iPhone generation in about 8 weeks from now and we just can't justify a purchase of the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus a few weeks before their price goes down ?100 or more. Opting now for an iOS phone is pointless unless you need it ASAP for any reason.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What didn't make the cut<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The roundup was tough, but cutting phones from the list was even tougher. There are devices that are very good at what they do and yet there are just better offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First we skipped the Samsung Galaxy J1. It was designed to be an extremely affordable smartphone and while it is a good performer, it costs almost &#x20ac;100 - twice as much as an Alcatel Fire E and a lot more than the Lumia 532. Even a Moto E, which is more powerful, costs less. We skipped the Galaxy Young 2 for similar reasons, it is far inferior compared to Moto E, yet costs just &#x20ac;5-&#x20ac;10 less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy J1 &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy J1 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We passed on the Lumia 530, Lumia 630 and 635 largely in favor of the Lumia 535. Microsoft stated that even phones with 512MB RAM will be updated to the upcoming OS versions, but having at least 1GB of RAM is still a huge boon to multitasking. True, the Lumia 435 has 1 gig of RAM, but its dual-core processor made us think that spending a few euros more on the Lumia 532 is the smarter move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia Lumia 530 &#x2022; Nokia Lumia 630 &#x2022; Nokia Lumia 635 &#x2022; Microsoft Lumia 435</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 2 Mini S was a rather good offer last spring, but its dated OS, limited storage and aging hardware don't deserve a &#x20ac;170 price tag. There are far better phones today, especially the Asus Zenfone 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Alcatel Idol 2 Mini S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also skipped a bunch of LG smartphones, just because the Sony Xperia E4g and the Motorola Moto G series offer better specs for less cash. The F60, L90, L Fino and L Bello are on the list of LG absentees.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG F60 &#x2022; LG L90 D405 &#x2022; LG L Fino &#x2022; LG L Bello</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Amazon Fire Phone, though heavily promoted, turned out a market failure. It may be innovative and powerful, but users just aren't impressed. If you aren't an experience XDA user, or you don't like to side-load pretty much every Android app on your phone, the Fire Phone is just not for you. Its future looks rather uncertain right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Amazon Fire Phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We replaced the Sony Xperia T3 and Xperia C3 with the Xperia M2 Aqua and Xperia M4 Aqua respectively. Those are quite similar but the Aqua phones are water and dust proof. We also skipped the BlackBerry Z10 in favor of the newer BlackBerry Leap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia T3 &#x2022; Sony Xperia C3 &#x2022; BlackBerry Z10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2, while sporting an amazing all metal shell, runs on a dated Snapdragon 400 chip, which may cause performance bottlenecks because of the hefty Sense UI. Plus, you can get the more powerful and prettier Xperia Z1 Compact for even less money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One mini 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) and HTC One (E8) didn't make it because of the excellent HTC Desire Eye. It offers better camera than the UltraPixel misunderstanding, which turned out the Achilles' wheel of the second generation of the One series.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC One (M8) &#x2022; HTC One (E8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z3 and the newer Xperia Z3+ were dropped because they bring little new to the series, plus the Snapdragon 810 overheating issues of the latter and its insanely high price tag. The Xperia Z3+ costs almost the same as a Galaxy S6 edge, which is rather unreasonable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia Z3 &#x2022; Sony Xperia Z3+</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry gained back some lost confidence with its Passport, but its squarish design makes it too large for casual use. It's too much of a niche device to merit a general recommendation, but business types are welcome to take a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same thing happened to the BlackBerry Classic and Z30 - BlackBerry isn't a premium name anymore and there's generally no reason to pay top dollar for it. If you have specific needs that are tied to the BlackBerry platform, then a Leap or Q5 can do just as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   BlackBerry Passport &#x2022; BlackBerry Classic &#x2022; BlackBerry Z30</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge is retiring from our offers in favor of the Galaxy S6 edge. In case you need the S-Pen, then you should better wait a few more weeks for the Galaxy Note 5's announcement at IFA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note Edge</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we've excluded the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus because Apple will be announcing the new generation of iPhones in 8 weeks and those will go at least &#x20ac;100 cheaper. There is no point spending a pile of cash right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Apple iPhone 5s &#x2022; Apple iPhone 6 &#x2022; Apple iPhone 6 Plus</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There you go. A few dozens of recommendations out of perhaps thousands of devices competing for your attention and, ultimately, hard-earned cash. Good luck trying to narrow down that selection. That has frankly never been the point. We just hand-picked some options that we think are worth a look - whether you are willing to spend 50 or 500+ on a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading and writing about phones is our hobby and our job, but spending your free hours on research is surely exhausting and frustrating. This is why we are trying to help you choose by those articles. As every other person out there, we also have our favorites, which we can easily recommend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you need a sub-?100 phone, you can't go wrong with the Motorola Moto E - it's fast, powerful and receives regular Android updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the ?100-?200 category, the Xiaomi Redmi 2 and the Sony Xperia E4g strike us as excellent choices for price/power/features/design. The Microsoft Lumia 640 series is another excellent option, especially for those subscribed to various Microsoft services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola Moto E ? Xiaomi Redmi 2 ? Sony Xperia E4g ? Microsoft Lumia 640 Dual SIM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are eyeing the ?200-?300 category, the big-screen Meizu m1 note, the water-proof Sony Xperia Z1 Compact or the LG G2 would do a fine job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Meizu m1 note ? Sony Xperia Z1 Compact ? LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our favorites in the ?300-?400 category are the small and thin Samsung Galaxy Alpha, the water-proof Sony Xperia Z3 Compact and the curved LG G Flex 2, which are all great all-rounders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Alpha ? Sony Xperia Z3 Compact ? LG G Flex2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is also a great buy, while the supplies last, as we're guessing this one will be phased out this autumn.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, our favorite in the top-tier - the metal+glass Galaxy S6 the S6 edge - both would offer you the best the market has today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Note 3 ? Samsung Galaxy S6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, coming up with these choice doesn't necessarily get you all the latest features but it certainly promises the best bang for buck possible. Every phone we've put in our shopping guide deserves a consideration so consider the phones above a sort of a cheat sheet. We've done our part and now it's up to you to choose your next companion, which hopefully will be with you for many years. Good luck!</paragraph>
