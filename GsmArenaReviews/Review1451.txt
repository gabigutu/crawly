			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia C3 is young and social, simple and reliable. Messaging and social networking are the very heart of this handset. But are they enough of a head-turner to become a phone's key selling points? Sure thing! Just add a pinch of charisma and hang a price tag fit for the masses and you've got yourself a recipe for a true love story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At its Indonesia launch, the phone drew massive crowds and it seems success in Europe is only a matter of time ? with a price tag of about 100 euro. Compromises are always implied in this price bracket but the Nokia C3 does well to focus all attention on its strengths. It?s a budget package ? no doubt about that ? but so wonderfully balanced. It has all the relevant features and the target audience isn?t likely to miss what?s not there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A QWERTY messenger focused on the basics, the Nokia C3 is an excellent upgrade option for the budget-minded. And social networking isn?t just a thing for marketing to work with. The full QWERTY keyboard, dedicated Messaging and Contacts keys, along with Wi-Fi connectivity round off a solid package that will give the right user all the performance they need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 is a social gadget for the young. What?s not to like if Facebook is your second home and you want to always stay in touch. Attractive design and the right feature set come at a price that many can afford. The Nokia C3 is so full of potential because it?s suited for both emerging and mature markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the low end, you will sometimes come across rare gems of phones that will surprise you with their styling and features. The Nokia C3 isn?t one of them. The key word here is enough. The build, the connectivity, the interface ? even the imaging ? is good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 2MP fixed-focus camera isn?t the kind to send your digicam into retirement ? it?s good enough for photography you need to quickly share. The screen isn?t perfect for media or browsing, there?s no fast network data, you have a QWERTY keyboard but no document editing ? you catch our drift.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t much to get excited about but ? we?ll say it again ? the right users will find more than enough to get excited about. The Nokia C3 is a phone that wants to be in every pocket ? let?s see if it is the right choice for you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C3 unboxed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 comes in a plain cardboard box. Other than the phone itself, you?ll get the typical basic accessories: a charger and the good old one-piece handsfree that ends on a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s of course a manual too and a 2GB microSD card is inserted in the phone. There is no USB cable enclosed and that?s perhaps an attempt to keep the price down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C3 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 is on the compact side of QWERTY messengers at 115.5 x 58.1 x 13.6 mm. The full four-row keyboard and the 2.4? landscape screen just couldn?t have been squeezed in less space than that. The phone is still very pocket-friendly and handles with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It tips the scales at 114 grams, which is probably a bit more than you would expect given the mostly plastic finish. There is some metal on the C3 ? the large battery cover is entire made of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia C3 has nearly perfect weight and balance for two-handed use. It?s a no-frills phone that doesn?t look or feel cheap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Photos do the phone little justice. We think we were lucky to have the best paint job for our test unit. This Slate Grey finish will not turn many heads but certainly makes the phone an extra bit more solid and sensible. The Nokia C3 is a basic S40 phone but looks no worse than a full featured smartphone like the E63.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, comparisons to the E71 or E72 are absolutely out of the question. What?s important however is that the keyboard and the screen are just as good. The C3 is thicker and rough around the edges but the C series are not trying to impress with fancy designs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 stays focused instead on friendly handling and good build quality. It?s a well put together phone ? no creaks, no gaps between parts. The tapered edges, front and back, make the thick handset quite comfortable and secure to hold in hand. Not to mention they bring along stylishness that?s quite unusual in this price segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 comes in three flavors ? Slate Grey (which is actually bluish), Golden White, and Hot Pink. It?s a small but widely varied selection that seems to reflect the audience demographics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Nokia C3 is all-plastic, with just the right amount of gloss to serve as an accent. The glossy front frame contrast nicely with the matt finish of the navigation deck and the keyboard. The shiny surface warmly welcomes fingerprints but they are easy to clean up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape 2.4" 256K-color display of 320 x 240 pixel resolution takes half of the front panel. The QVGA resolution is what you?d expect in this price range but the image quality is surprisingly good. So is sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen is a spacious navigation deck built around a reasonably tactile D-pad. There are three buttons on either side of the D-pad. Call and End knobs are at the bottom, the two soft keys on top. In between are the dedicated Contacts and the Messaging keys, which can be assigned a different function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys and the D-pad are user-configurable too. Up and Down on the Navigation key are best left in charge of the Active Standby homescreen, which provides handy shortcuts and is quite relevant to social networking. All controls are decently sized and quite comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of buttons, it?s time to take a closer look at the full QWERTY keyboard. The Nokia C3 obviously has no qualms stealing from the Esereis. The four-row QWERTY keypad has well defined and reasonably sized keys to rival the excellent typing skills of the E71. The nicely convex keys are equally tactile and even slightly bigger. The backlighting is impressively sharp and solid ? better than on the E71.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset features the microUSB port and the microSD card slot. Both apertures are sealed with plastic lids to hold off dust and keep the contour of the handset intact. USB charging is not enabled on the C3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 is said to support cards of up to 8GB, and this was as far as went testing it. The handset handled our card problem-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t much to see on the right-hand side of the Nokia C3. The phone has no dedicated volume controls and camera key. Up and Down on the D-pad set volume / zoom levels, and the confirm button is the camera shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover gets released by squeezing two knobs either side of the handset ? the way it works on the Nokia E71. In the bottom right corner is the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Nokia C3 features the 2mm charger plug as well as the 3.5mm standard audio jack; the bottom is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the glossy frame of the front panel, the rear has soft matt plastic top and bottom, and a all-metal battery cover. No fingerprint issues here whatsoever. Rearside are the massive hole of the 2 megapixel camera lens and the loudspeaker grill. The impressively looking lens aside, the fixed-focus cam turned out quite a disappointment but we?ll come back to it later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the aluminum cover is the 1320 mAh Li-Ion BL-5J battery, which powers the Nokia C3. The battery is quoted at to the impressive 800 hours of stand-by or up to 7 hours of talk-time. Considering the phone is working in 2G networks only, you can count on solid battery life even with a power-hungry WLAN.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Commendable build quality and neat design are great to have in an entry level handset. The C3 delivers fine on ergonomics too ? navigation and typing are excellent. There?s an easily accessible memory card slot and a 3.5 mm audio jack ? not bad at all for the price you pay.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S40 user interface is looking fancy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The C3 runs Nokia?s Series 40 user interface but it?s been styled to look a lot like Symbian S60 3rd. The dedicated Contacts and Messages buttons nod to the Eseries. Overall, the Nokia C3 UI tries to look above its pay grade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that much has changed ? at its core it?s still the limited S40 software so don?t expect any surprising novelties in the UI section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S40 strengths are still valid ? simple and easy when it comes to the essential functions, no hanging, no bugs. Simple is not always bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen of the Nokia C3 features the pre-selected wallpaper with the usual status readings, such as signal strength, battery status, ringing profile icon and time occupying the top part of the screen. The fonts are large and readable across the whole interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode (or Home screen mode, as Nokia call it here) is the default homescreen. It consists of three active rows that can be edited or relocated as users see fit ? you can think of them as limited widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Out of the box, the top row is the favorite contacts, followed by the Communities bar (which shows updates from Facebook and Twitter) and at the bottom, the shortcuts bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu seems to follow the same easy-on-the-eye concept with its several available view modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The major drawback of Series 40 is the lack of multitasking ? and we?ll never see it implemented. But a lot of the features help work around this problem ? like the new Communities app, which pulls updates in the background and Ovi Chat, which is a native app now and loads much faster than J2ME alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both apps let you stay online and receive updates even when the app is not active which, as far as messaging is concerned, sorts out the lack of multitasking. And it?s not like there are a lot of third-party apps you?d install on an S40 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upshot of this is that the battery lasts longer and there are no unexpected hang-ups when background-running apps start acting up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the limited choice of third party apps and the lack of a document viewer are undoubtedly big Series 40 flaws. If those are things you need, Nokia would offer you the Symbian platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 doesn?t have an accelerometer, but pressing the red receiver key when the phone is locked displays a big digital clock ? a very handy way to check the time if you don?t have a watch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia C3 stores up to 1000 contacts ? as far as most people are concerned, this is as good as unlimited storage. The phonebook is typical S40 and holds no surprises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names, eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization. Custom ringtones and videos can be assigned to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between normal and large font in the phonebook. The way contacts are displayed is also user-configurable ? a simple list, list of name or numbers and a list with names and contact images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up quick dial shortcuts or adding contacts as favorite on the Active Standby homescreen gives you quick access to the most used contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In-call sound is strong and clear and even though the signal indicator dips to one bar sometimes, it still doesn?t drop the call. Vibration strength is not very impressive though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 lacks the Voice Clarity enhancement, which is a common feature on S40 phones but it?s not that badly missed. During a call, you have the option to record the conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An application to mention here is voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary as it is fully speaker independent. Nokia has not included any Smart dialing features though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out Nokia C3 is a Very Good performer. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is this phone?s element<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 feels right at home when it comes to messaging. The phone is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email, as well as flash and audio messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there?s social networking and IMs ? Facebook, Twitter and Ovi Chat are natively supported on the Nokia C3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing is a great experience on the Nokia C3 with its full keyboard. The interface is very familiar and you won?t need much time to find your way around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you?re done typing, click Send to and you can pick from a variety of options ? look up the phonebook, pick the favorite contact, recently used recipients, choose from the call log and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client does pretty well to meet most user needs. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up the email client was extremely easy. All the Nokia C3 needs is your email address and password and it will take care of techy stuff like server addresses and ports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next in the messaging hierarchy is IM messaging ? the Nokia C3 supports Ovi Chat. But you?re not limited to just Ovi Chat users, you can also add G-Talk contacts ? this means everyone with a Gmail account ? and Yahoo and MSN Messenger too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In previous phones the chat client was a J2ME app and took quite a while to start up. On the Nokia C3 however, Chat is natively supported ? you can stay online even when the app isn?t visible and when you choose to reply, the app loads very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Chat is quite comprehensive ? you can chat with several contacts at once, change status, save conversations for later viewing and so on. When a new message arrives, the phone will chime and vibrate ? and if you have the Chat panel enabled on the homescreen, then you?ll see who sent you the message as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s the more public world of social networking ? it?s not just one to one messaging. The Nokia C3 comes with a Communities app, which brings Twitter and Facebook on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Chat panel, this one lets you see both the message sender (including a contact photo) and the message itself (part of it at least, if it?s too long).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you have several messages, you can scroll through them by using the left/right keys on the D-pad. Unlike the Chat app though, Communities is a J2ME app, so while it can show you messages on the Active Standby homescreen, you?d have to wait until it launches (it takes a few seconds) if you want to reply.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Communities can manage several accounts for both Facebook and Twitter though only one of each can be signed in at a time.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo gallery and file browser separate at long last<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S40 Gallery app tried to be too many things at once and being a photo gallery wasn?t among its strong points. Now, there?s a separate icon in the main menu ? Photos, which serves the one and only purpose of viewing the photos and videos on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that its functionality has changed much, but at least now file browsing features don?t get in the way of browsing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app on the Nokia C3 offers only a single view mode, displaying a grid of 12 pictures on the screen. At least zooming in on a single picture is pretty comfortable now with the zoom in and out shortcuts placed on the middle and right soft keys. It?s also rather fast and smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize photos into albums, view them in a timeline (they are ordered by the date they were taken) and of course you can set up a slide show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the regular Gallery app, it?s still here ? but it?s hidden in the Applications menu. It?s quite a capable file manager, especially for a feature phone. It can manage folders and files ? both one by one and in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Nokia C3 has decent looks and a good feature set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can sort songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, WMA, AMR-NB. Naturally A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones. There are preset equalizers settings available and you can customize another two, plus there?s Stereo widening available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the artist and title of the currently playing song are shown on the homescreen ? but only if you have the Radio and Media player bar on the Active Standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of volume keys is inconvenient ? you can only control the volume when the music player is active.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to the preloaded content on Nokia C3 is the FM radio. It matches the music player interface and covers all basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS support is available and you can get the handset search and save all available stations in your area. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen (again, if the appropriate bar is enabled), much like with the music player. There?s also a station directory, which pulls data about local radio stations from the Internet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is very limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S40 platform was never particularly good at playing videos and things haven?t changed all that much. Not that we were expecting DivX support in a phone like the Nokia C3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of Nokia C3 is only compatible with 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, fast-forwarded or rewound and that?s that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is decent, but the volume is low<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Audio quality is an area where we got used to seeing good results from Nokia handsets over the past year or so. Fortunately the C3 makes no exception, providing nice and clean audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is spot on for virtually the entire range and the noise level and dynamic range readings are simply superb. Distortion levels are also pleasingly low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are only two things separating the C3 from perfection. The bigger shortcoming is its below-par headphones loudness, while the more minor issue is its uninspiring stereo crosstalk reading. See for yourselves in the table below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C5 vs Sony Ericsson Aspen frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more info about the testing process here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is an unimpressive 2MP shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 packs a 2MP fixed focus-camera, which snaps photos at 1600x1200 pixels and quite expectedly, results aren?t particularly impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited but reasonable given the phone?s price range. The available settings include white balance, resolution, various effects and a self timer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording is no good either<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 is rather unimpressive in video capture too ? it manages QVGA@20fps, which isn?t any good by anyone?s standards. We guess that sort of video is only good for an occasional MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a sample video, so you see for yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is good for an S40 phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Compared to the big league, the Nokia C3 is no connectivity monster. But for its price range it is very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 has quad-band GSM/EDGE connectivity so it will have voice and data connectivity in most of the world. And EDGE has enough bandwidth for IM messages, Twitter and Facebook updates, even for comfortable browsing with Opera Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you need to transfer a lot of data, Wi-Fi jumps to the rescue ? it?s faster than 3G and there should be enough free hotspots you could hook up to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For local connectivity, you have Bluetooth 2.1 with stereo audio support. The 3.5mm audio jack lets you plug in your favorite pair of headphones which is a good thing too. The microUSB port is nice as well (and covered with a plastic flap no less), but you?d be unpleasantly surprised when you try to charge your Nokia C3 over USB ? it just doesn?t work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For bulk data transfers, the easiest option is the microSD card ? it?s easily accessible and hot-swappable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Opera Mini is the browser of choice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default browser on the C3 is Opera Mini 4.2. You can download the newer version that offers new stuff such as multiple tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia browser is still available but it?s been delegated other duties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way Mini works is the page is rendered on Opera's servers and sent into a lighter format to the device, with the images compressed. While this somewhat degrades the quality, on a small screen (as most low-power devices that rely on the Mini have) you can't tell the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in image quality aside, the compression really saves on data charges. For example, GSMArena.com clocks in at about 370KB through Nokia?s S40 browser and just under 70KB through Opera Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This saves on data and more importantly speeds things up ? the Nokia C3 relies on EDGE when there?s no Wi-Fi around, so having to download much less data means faster browsing. Opera?s rendering algorithm is very good and problems with page rendering are very rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the Nokia browser, it handles the so called ?Web services?. Those are basically web apps like Nokia?s mobile site, AccuWeather, Reuters, MySpace and others. You can add new ones if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess things have been set up like that because the S40 browser supports JavaScript on web pages (which web apps use heavily), while Opera Mini has very limited support for scripts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t use the S40 browser to freely browse the web ? there?s no way to enter a URL and selecting the ?Browse web? option from the menu brings you around to Opera Mini.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia C3 is very elaborate, offering a large number of time management applications with nice features and a user-friendly interface. The calendar offers month, week, and day modes and five types of events to set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable: it can be set to go off on any selected days of the week, even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition a loan calculator is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The consistently useful unit converter is first in the list of additional applications. It offers a variety of modes and, if provided with info on current exchange rates, it will do currency conversion too. There's an additional converter that gives you clothing and shoe size equivalents worldwide.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since the Industrial Revolution things have been getting a whole lot cheaper. They aren?t quite as pretty as hand-crafted items, but they work, quite often better than their more expensive counterparts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Nokia C3 is not an Eseries top dog. But it works ? when it comes to messaging, it?s hard to find a fault with it. We mustn?t downplay the exterior either ? the Nokia C3 is quite a looker with its tapered edges, metal back and glossy front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throw in Wi-Fi support and the Contacts and Messaging keys, which are similar to the Eseries keys, and the Nokia C3 is beginning to look like a mass-market Nokia E72.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s not accounting for the software limitations though. The Nokia C3 is strictly for messaging, there?s no office document support. And no multitasking means you can?t keep Skype (or Fring, etc.) running in the background. And even if you could, the J2ME versions of those apps don?t support voice calls, just IM messaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And so we circle back to messaging. While Ovi Chat isn?t all that popular, G-Talk is ? and apps like Fring take care of Skype, Yahoo, Windows Messenger, ICQ, AIM chatting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Communities app handles the social aspect of messaging ? Twitter and Facebook let you stay in touch with all your friends at once, not just one at a time. Communities and Chat can work in the background, keeping you always online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3 offers a package that is almost impossible to find at this price point ? QWERTY, Wi-Fi along with IM and social networking integration for less than 100 euro is a steal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the strongest competition is the iNQ Chat 3G ? a QWERTY-enabled bar with IM and SNS in mind. It doesn?t have Wi-Fi but it comes with 3G and native Skype support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   iNQ Chat 3G ? LG GW300 ? BlackBerry Pearl 8120</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another one that?s very close to the mark is the LG GW300. Wi-Fi is missing here as well and its camera is just 2MP, but it supports multitasking and comes with a pretty good Facebook app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also in the running is the BlackBerry Pearl 8120 ? it?s got SureType instead of the regular QWERTY variety, and like the Nokia C3 it relies on 2G/EDGE and Wi-Fi. But there?s a major gap between the C3 (the iNQ Chat 3G too) and the Berry. The Pearl 8120 is a business phone complete with a document editor ? but no IM and SNS to get in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia E5 ? Nokia E63</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E5 is a full-featured smartphone alternative that will be targeting a completely different set of users. The two phones may look very similar, but E5 trades up to Symbian on a 600MHz processor, 3G with HSDPA and a 5MP camera. Until then, the Nokia E71 and E72 will have to do. If you don?t mind the older hardware, you can go for a Nokia E63 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Affordable messaging on the go is what the Nokia C3 excels at. The quad-band GSM support is a guarantee for worldwide roaming, while Wi-Fi should keep you connected where ever you go. The Nokia C3 makes sure you have the right tools to stay in touch with friends and family. The nice styling and focused feature set at a price that young people can afford will draw customers to the stores.</paragraph>
