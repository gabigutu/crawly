			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>QWERTY is how the Cookie crumbles and LG are quite keen to build on a winning concept. And they sure didn?t work themselves to the bone. When you?ve got a Best Handset Award nominee (LG KS360) and a midrange bestseller (LG KP500), all you need to do is add two and two together. Simple math for a simple gadget: the LG GW520 is a basic touchscreen with a distinct Cookie feel, full QWERTY keyboard and social networking on its mind. Sounds right for keeping the younger crowd interested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of you might know it as the LG Calisto. Never mind the name, it?s the same cute little fella we?re about to review in a sec. What makes it so interesting is not only the competitive price and decent feature set. We?re also curious to find how the blend of KS360 and Cookie works. It?s not about which one gets credit as the real predecessor, it?s what the offspring can do for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 is pretty much a Cookie with a real friendly QWERTY keyboard and fast data. The touchscreen size is the only downgrade so to say, but the full keyboard, 7.2 mbps HSDPA, push email and notifications and enhanced Widget UI are well worth the trade-off. Well, Cookie seems to rhyme quite well with QWERTY so far, now let?s see how long it?ll go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi support would have gained the GW520 lots of extra points against the competition. But then, that would?ve involved so much smartphone pressure, which the GW520 is definitely not prepared to handle. In a way, the handset can be construed as a Cookie upgrade and a response to Samsung?s deployment in the touchscreen midrange. Affordability is key after all, and the LG GW520 is well-geared to run against the likes of Samsung Preston and Star.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other things sacrificed to keep the price within acceptable limits are the camera autofocus and GPS. The latter isn?t such a big deal for a feature phone, but autofocus should be a must for a contemporary mobile phone in this class. It seems to us DivX/XviD support isn?t too much to ask either: it?s absolutely relevant to the target audience and LG have the technology anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may look like you pretty much know what to expect from the LG GW520 (or the QWERTY-enabled Cookie, which we?re so keen to call it). But it won?t be fair to judge the phone before we?ve seen it in action. Join us after this very small jump as we explore the looks and feel of this neat QWERTY slider.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package: bare necessities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering the price tag, no one is really expecting wonders with the retail package of the LG GW520. You can of course count on it that the essentials are covered. The GW520 package just won't go any further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The included handsfree is one piece, which means you're stuck with the provided headphones. If you want to change you will most likely need a proprietary LG microUSB to 3.5mm adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other items in the box are a USB data cable and a charger. The LG GW520 connectivity port is standard microUSB and the handset is proven compatible with third-party chargers and data cables. That unfortunately, doesn?t apply to microUSB headphones. It?s either a unit-specific issue or LG simply won?t let users choose alternative headsets over their own.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG GW520 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For a full QWERTY side-slider, the LG GW520 manages to keep size as friendly as possible. It measures 106.5 x 53 x 15.9 mm which makes it almost as compact as the Cookie and the KS360. The weight, on the other hand, reaches 125.5 g which might sound a bit too much for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we found that size and weight just about perfect for the form factor. The handset feels pretty solid and handles comfortably, we enjoyed using it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve been there with the Cookie: the GW520 is neat and minimalist yet distinctly fresh and appealing. Many people will appreciate the slightly more conservative approach ? there?s more Cookie here than KS360, no flashy paintjobs and toy-like looks. For the rest, there still are enough alternative color combos. Along with the silver and pearl white variants the handset will also be offered in blue on black and red on black. Either way, the handset keeps enough youthful spirit and personality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing fancy and frilly about the rubbery finish at the back but it adds to the solid feel and friendly charm of the phone. It's also quite practical and fingerprint-resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the LG GW520 resembles the KP500 Cookie for the three hardware buttons below the screen. Those include a Call and an End key on either side of the Launcher/Multitasking key that brings up a menu of shortcuts to your favorite apps and a task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel is taken by the 2.8" 256K-color display of 240 x 400 pixel resolution. Other than size (the Cookie screen is a three-incher), the only difference is the lack of a stylus on the GW560. Quite obviously, handwriting recognition wasn?t deemed necessary given the QWERTY keyboard so it?s not available either. The only letdown is actually an issue common to all LG handsets - sunlight legibility is quite behind the best examples marketing the industry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the LG GW520 resembles the KP500 Cookie for the three hardware buttons below the screen. Those include a Call and an End key on either side of the Launcher/Multitasking key that brings up a menu of shortcuts to your favorite apps and a task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG GW520 has a very friendly four-row slide-out QWERTY keypad with well spaced keys and excellent touch orientation. There is a dedicated shortcut to the message composer on the keypad, as well as tiny LEDs to indicate Caps Lock and Num Lock/Symbol Lock. The even backlighting guarantees hassle-free typing in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only control on the lefthand side of the GW520 is the volume rocker, which serves as a digital zoom lever in the camcorder too (2x max) and the image gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opposite side is a bit overcrowded. There we find the microSD card slot (covered by a protective plastic lid), key lock and camera key. Although LG claim up to 8GB microSD card support, we used a 16GB card and had no problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port (used for data connections and plugging a headset or charger) is placed at the top. Just like the microSD card slot, it has a plastic cover to hold off dust, and keep the contour of the handset intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is quite bare. It only accommodates the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker and the camera lens are easily visible on the back of the device. The 3 megapixel snapper of the GW520 doesn't have a flash but the real big loss is autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover is a breeze ? you simply slide up to release. Underneath is the 950 mAh Li-Ion battery. The LG GW520 is said to offer up to 5 h of talk time and up to 500 h of standby time. Unfortunately, we can't comment on the real-life battery performance as we use the phone quite extensively during our test ? usually in a way that?s not representative for common everyday usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy with the ergonomics of LG GW520. We should also point out the very good build: it's an all plastic piece of gear but solid and quite durable. The handset handles nicely, the slider action is smooth and solid, and surfaces (except the screen) are fingerprint-proof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 is not thin at all, but remains compact, and offers a secure hand hold. Operating with it is exceptionally comfortable in both single hand (quick tapping on the touchscreen) and two-hand scenarios. Typing on the QWERTY keyboard is quite fast as well and the handset has commendable balance with the slider up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Widgets and Livesquare<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The GW520 has the latest Flash-based touch interface by LG, very similar to what the KP500 Cookie offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface features a lot of nice animations and transition effects. For example, when you get to the bottom of a scrolling list, the items don't just stop rolling, but bounce and throb to your sweeps with almost physical elasticity as on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is generally quick and responsive enough and lagging is rarely an issue. The LG GW520 brings two homescreen panes. The first is a Widget-populated screen that lets you arrange the available several mini applications as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get to the second homescreen you sweep your finger sideways across the screen. The screen turns over like you roll a cube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A touch on the marker in the bottom right corner of the homescreen pulls out the Widgets tray, which holds all of the currently unused widgets. You can choose the ones you want and drag them onto the screen or hide the ones you don't need back in the tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 offers an analog clock, a mini FM radio, a mini music player, a notes app, Image slideshow, a world clock, a calendar, WeatherBug, cellular info, web search and Facebook widgets as well as Push e-mail widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, new widgets cannot be added. That is the main disadvantage compared to the competing Samsung TouchWiz feature phone interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature allows you to align the widgets onscreen by shaking the handset thanks to the built-in accelerometer. For this to work however you need to have the widgets tray open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next is the Livesquare homescreen, which is one of the few notable improvements over the Cookie. The Livesquare is in essence a log of all your communication. They are displayed on the screen in several different layouts. You can set the background as a Zoo or a Park, populated by small human or animal figures notifying of missed events or received calls and messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of messages (or other events like incoming calls and emails) is displayed in a small bubble next to each figure. You even get such figures for events from unknown contacts - ones that are not present in your phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also set the Livesquare to reset every day so you'll see only today's events. Using the grey button in the bottom left corner you can access a complete communication history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone supports threaded messaging view so conversations are displayed as an IM chat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the homescreen you will find a navigation bar with four non-negotiable shortcuts. The first one takes you to the Dial pad to punch in a number, the second opens the Contacts list, the third one takes you to Messaging, and the last one brings up the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu system is simple, yet decently organized and generally very usable. The main menu consists of four tabs - they are displayed in a column on the right-hand side of the screen. Changing the tabs is done by clicking the respective icons. Alternatively you can select the scrolling menu option from the settings where you can change tabs by simply sweeping your finger accross the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, the LG GW520 interface auto rotates when you turn the handset to landscape mode. The feature works selectively and is only available in the web browser, when typing a message, browsing images or watching a video. Rotation is quick but perhaps not the smoothest we've seen. The interface also rotates when you slide out or in the QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GW520 comes equipped with a task manager allowing you to run several Java and native applications simultaneously and effortlessly switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager on the GW520 has a "launcher" tab that hosts a number of configurable shortcuts to various applications. LG GW520 offers nine slots since the favorite apps list isn't scrollable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing the GW520 shares with the other recent touch phones by LG is the Status screen - touching any of the icons on the status row on top (next to the clock) opens up a screen with readings about signal, battery and memory stats, and allows you to quickly toggle the ringing profiles, music player and Bluetooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook capacity offered by the LG GW520 is up to 1000 contacts, each with its full set of details. You can organize your contacts into caller groups, and you can also assign them a personal picture and a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a bunch of available fields for each contact on your list - you start off with fourteen fields, but once you enter a number or an email address, an additional field of the same type becomes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add a note to a contact and when you enter the birthday field, you can also have the phone save the date to the calendar as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling the contacts list is fluid and friendly. In fact, LG have done a great job with scrolling throughout the user interface so it's almost as enjoyable as on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't want to go through all the contacts to reach those starting with "Z" for example, you can either use the search box at the top or you can drag the side scrollbar, which seems the quicker option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt for displaying the SIM and phone contacts separately, as well as all together in a single list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 handles phone calls trouble-free, no voice quality or reception issues.There is Smart Dialing, and Speed dials are supported. When you hit a key, which has been assigned, you get hinted of the contact in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Smart Dial is quite useless as it only searches for contacts whose numbers contain the digits you typed. This just isn't of much use since most people don't bother to remember the numbers of their contacts as long as they got their names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 scored an Excellent mark in our loudspeaker performance test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: now we're talking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 handles SMS, MMS, and email. Much like most other handsets by LG, SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For typing you can use either the on-screen multi-tap alphanumeric keypad, or you can rotate the GW520 and slide out the hardware QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to emails, the LG GW520 deals with them hassle-free. Setting up an email account is a breeze thanks to the clever setup. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically. Furthermore, we were prompted to select between POP and IMAP setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you need to enter. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported. You can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The email client supports SSL too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum outgoing mail size is set to 2.2 MB while incoming mail can not succeed 300 KB. Still, such limitations are a nuisance in a modern email client and we suspect they're imposed to save network carriers the traffic hassle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, archive files such as ZIP or RAR are not among the supported file types for attachments, but still you can save those to the phone memory when you receive them. MS Office and PDF files can be opened and previewed directly via the email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've downloaded your messages, you can use the search feature to find specific emails or you can sort them by various filters such as date, sender, priority, read/unread, subject, size, etc. There is also an option for marking multiple emails as "Read".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly for a device in this class, the GW520 also sports Push e-mail. The Push email app is preinstalled and can be even accessed by a dedicated widget on the screen. Naturally, being a Java app, the Push email works only when the app is open - but keeping it running in the background is easy thanks to the nice task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Push email, the GW520 also has a Facebook Java app, which can also be left to run in the background, but it doesn't support push as was expected and you need to update your Facebook wall to check for new content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia performance is a pleasant surprise<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It was a nice surprise to find the multimedia performance of the GW520 a good match for handsets like the much more expensive KC910 Renoir. Except for the reduced internal memory (40MB, compared to 100MB on the Renoir) you will hardly find any difference between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With up to 16GB memory cards supported, no one will actually care about the miserly 40MB of inbuilt storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File browsing is generally fast but when you have a memory card inserted, each time you open the file browser it needs to refresh the image thumbnails. Not much of a problem if you have a small picture gallery, but it could get annoying (taking several seconds) with a huge number of photos. But that's a common issue for all current LG handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another drawback is that no matter what file sorting you opt for (date, type, name), the files on the memory card always get listed first. While that might not be much of a problem to most users it doesn't make much sense really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 file manager includes separate factory-preset folders for different file content. However, unlike some previous generation LG handsets (and those include even some pretty expensive ones) it has no problem handling user-created folders and the files in them. Boy, were we relieved to see that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG have vastly improved their image gallery with the recent generation of touchscreens and now it offers a really nice handling. Flipping through images feels so natural and fluid that it is comparable to the best in class - the Apple iPhone 3GS. And the photos taken with GW520 are of the same 3.15 megapixel resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check your photos straight in the file manager or you can start the dedicated gallery where larger thumbnails are available. Still, the viewer for single images is one and the same for both methods.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse images in portrait or landscape mode just by changing the orientation of the handset. Unfortunately, zooming on an image is a bit slow and choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG GW520 also features the same image editor as the KP500 Cookie and the KC910 Renoir with their wide range of options. First off, you get a creative part that allows finger drawing on images, text typing, clipart watermarking, face morphing, selective colorization, and selective color boosting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then you have tools for basic image treatment such as rotate, resize and mirror, as well as more advanced photo editing options such as levels, brightness, contrast, color, hue and saturation, sharpness, blur. Red-eye removal is also available. Finally, you can add color effects such as black &amp; white, sepia, negative, glow, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, despite the rich features of the editor, we think it scores low on usability. The different options are inconsistently spread across various menus. Nevertheless, we highly doubt that most users will edit photos on their mobiles anyway.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Cookie sweet music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 has the really nice music player we found in KP500 Cookie. The great things about it are the seriously enhanced Album Art visualization and the equalizer presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the LG GW520 music player you can filter tracks as with any other modern music player - by artist, album, genre, and recently played. User-created playlists are also an option. Naturally, the music player can run in the background. You can control the music straight on the home screen with the dedicated mini player widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that equalizers are available, you can opt for one of five presets or you can turn it off to enjoy the track's original sound. A rating system has also been added, which allows you to give a score of 1 to 5 stars to each track.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 comes with an FM radio and you can enjoy it on either earphones or on the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the earphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio stores up to 50 stations and there is support for receiving two-line radio station info over RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with the music player, when you minimize the FM radio you can control it using the home screen widget.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is nothing special<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Due to the lack of DivX and XviD support, videos are less of a perk compared to the advanced cameraphones of the house. YouTube integration has also been omitted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can run in both portrait and landscape mode, the latter of course the preferred way with the widescreen display. Alternating the two modes is as easy as flipping the phone to its side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature allows you to take screenshots of a running video and there is also a built-in video editor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Satisfying 3 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Given the phone's distinct youth appeal, the LG GW520 camera surely becomes an important feature. The handset sports a 3 megapixel fixed focus snapper with a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. It has no flash of any kind, so night photography is not really an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is almost identical to the one of the LG KC910 Renoir and KP500 Cookie. Even if not the most user friendly we've seen, it is nothing you can't get used to. It offers a moderate amount of user-configurable settings including white balance, effects and quality settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the viewfinder you get to pick whether the frame should appear fullscreen (which involves cropping due to the sensor and the screen having different aspect ratios) or actual size, whereby you get black stripes for the unused screen width on both sides of the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir didn't have that option at all, thus forcing the fullscreen cropped version upon the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images produced by the LG GW520 have more than enough detail, no over sharpening or purple fringing and noise levels are tolerable. The only noticeable problem is the blurring in the bottom left corner of all the pictures, probably due to a lens problem. It might as well be a unit-specific issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the handset captures video in up to QVGA resolution. With enough cameraphones around shooting WVGA@30fps this is hardly a commendable achievement by today's standards. Still, if you only watch your videos on the phone's screen things might not be too bad, and we shouldn't forget the price tag after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file format used here is 3GP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video from LG GW520's camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity upgraded to 3G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE is on board and so is 7.2 Mbps HSDPA. The other LG GW520 connectivity options include Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP and USB v2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four available USB connection modes on the LG GW520 including Mass Storage, which makes both the internal memory and memory card appear as removable drives on your computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also receive calls when connected in this mode but an incoming call interrupts the connection to the internal memory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 has a generally nice web browser, with good touch response and a moderate amount of features. Zooming and scrolling is fast enough and you can drag pages around with your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse web pages with or without the controls visible. A tap on the screen brings back the controls. Zooming in and out is quite intuitive too - a longer hold on a section of a web page will zoom in so it fits on the screen from side to side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the screen landscape is automatic thanks top the built-in accelerometer and it makes browsing even more enjoyable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If all that is not enough, the browser can work with up to two separate tabs and it can save web pages to be viewed offline. You can also search web pages for specific text strings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like on other recent LG touch phones, you can opt for visual history whereby recently visited sites are quite conveniently displayed as a line of webpage screenshots - you can flip through them and just pick the one you want to open again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, desktop YouTube watching is a no-go, as the browser lacks full Flash support. You can however go for the streaming mobile version of YouTube at m.youtube.com.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer can save the day<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG GW520 has a decent set of time-management applications. It's obviously not pitched at business people and its target audience should be quite happy with the features offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward, offering monthly, weekly and daily view modes and decently finger-optimized browsing. When you tap on a date, a pop-up appears so you can see what's under the tip of your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which day should be the first of the week by default (options are Monday or Sunday). You can also choose the default view - weekly or monthly. Adding one of the three category events (appointment, anniversary, birthday) is as simple as it gets. The LG GW520 can store up to 500 calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a separate To-Do application and it also has room for up to 500 tasks. A Memo feature allows storing some notes (up to 100). Another organizing app is the Date Finder, which can instantly tell you what day of the week any given date will be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can backup your calendar events and to-do's on the memory card and restore them later on if needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has 5 alarm slots available. Each of them can have its own title, trigger time and repeat pattern (snooze time can also be customized), as well as tone and memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing applications on the GW520 are a calculator, unit converter, stopwatch, world clock and a voice recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 also offers office document viewing courtesy of the built-in Picsel viewer. As we managed to confirm, the viewer supports DOC, XLS, PPT and PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling and zooming in documents is very fast and fluid, except on extremely close zoom levels. This seems to be the case with most LG handsets in fact but we don't think it's that important. No one actually needs to zoom in that close. Text searching is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can of course view your documents in landscape mode, which kicks in automatically thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Three games to play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are three preinstalled games on the LG GW520 - Flying Dice, Pipes and Sudoku.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flying Dices is an accelerometer-based gimcrack used for rolling a pair of dice by shaking the handset. It also offers a set of really simple mini games, including a drinking game. Maybe this is the right handset to get a party off the ground.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pipes is a nice puzzle game, where you put together different shapes to complete the pipe system and get the water running.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It almost feels like quite a few Cookie users get the sneaky thought they should've waited for this one. We'd go ahead and tell them they don't need to feel cheated. The Cookie did a great job (and still does) of making touchscreen so sweetly affordable, spirited and fun. The GW520 keeps up the momentum and even takes it further. It doesn't doom the Cookie to oblivion though. There will still be demand for basic touch phones that make sense and are so full of character.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW520 simply responds to a changed environment and boosts LG's presence in the touchscreen midrange. The upgrades it brings are of course important but we still think the Cookie can comfortably co-exist with a 3G enabled QWERTY messenger. They both target the same audience, which will welcome we guess the diverse supply in terms of form factor and features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt the Cookie caused a stir in the lower touchscreen ranks and the full-scale response of the competition shows what a successful concept it was. LG just couldn't afford to be complacent and the GW520 is their response to the massive attack on the Cookie by Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KP500 Cookie</paragraph>
			<paragraph>QWERTY messengers are usually high-end stuff and trespassing on smartphone territory is always dangerous. The LG GW520 is focused enough to not fear retribution. It knows its place and doesn't lose sight of its key objective - to engage the Samsung S5600 Preston while the Cookie handles the Star and the Corby.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In the end, the LG GW520 is filling a niche for basic and affordable QWERTY messengers and we sure don't mind. It would've been near perfect with an S-Class UI, but we know the interface is still too precious to spare. Anyway, we can't really hold that against the GW520 in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's more, the current price of around 160 euro is even less of an issue considering that carriers will perhaps find the phone quite appealing and will drop the price even more by subsidizing it heavily. The GW520 may count on the kind of popularity the Cookie and the KS360 enjoyed with Orange and Vodafone.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A 3G enabled carrier-subsidized QWERTY messenger with social networking on its mind and with a solid data and messaging plan in its pocket sounds good enough for the target audience by our books. The good blend (and a solid upgrade) of two already good handsets makes it even better.</paragraph>
