			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In today's rapidly-growing market, it's the push for more CPU cores and (mega)pixels that has been driving the industry forward. But every now and then, an extraordinary gadget emerges to explore new and exciting dimensions. Devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note and the Asus Padfone dare to go against the tide and remind everyone that there's more than one right way to make a phone. Or a tablet. Or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus obviously doesn't have Samsung's momentum, level of sales or, ultimately, an unlimited budget to really go all out on a project like this, but the first Padfone was successful enough to warrant another go-around. A year later, the sequel has a foundation to build upon, and the company has had time to learn and get stuff ironed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And going by the Padfone 2's specs, Asus are hoping to make a splash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the second Padfone you have a properly-powered smartphone just a 1080p screen short of matching the 2013 flagships, and one that converts into an equally powerful tablet. The station screen is not quite up to Retina standards either, but considering the price of the whole package, Asus is still vastly over-delivering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, the Asus Padfone 2 is priced rather steeply for a smartphone, but it's actually a fraction of what you'd normally pay for a quad-core smartphone and a quad-core tablet. Not to mention the added convenience of having all your files, contacts and accounts at your disposal at all times, regardless of which screen you're using.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Which leads us to the catch. You are not actually getting a smartphone and a tablet here, it's simply two screens to work with and two batteries to power the same combo. The best thing is, the Padfone station (the tablet body) will charge the phone's battery too. Think: a tablet with an escape pod, or a phone that can more than quadruple its screen size when needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a smart concept indeed, but we're yet to see how good the Padfone is at both jobs. The first impression it made on us back in October was very positive, so we're looking forward to exploring it in-depth and seeing how well the tandem performs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware overview is coming up right after the break and there's more stuff than usual to tick off the checklist, so let's get to it!</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Two boxes, same content<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 actually ships in two separate boxes, one for each piece of the hybrid device. There isn't a whole lot of extra accessories though, you just get the usual stuff - a pair of headphones, an AC adapter with a full-sized USB port and the company's proprietary 13-pin cable. There's also a small tool for opening the SIM tray.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Asus Padfone 2 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 137.9 x 68.9 x 9 mm, the Asus Padfone 2 is pretty compact for a 4.7" smartphone. It's about as wide as the LG Optimus 4, and even though it is notably taller, it's actually still pretty comfortable to carry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 135g, the Asus flagship also strikes a good balance between portability and solid feel. The docking station brings the overall weight to 649g, which is not the best in the 10" tablet realm, but still reasonable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 design takes after the company's Zenbooks with the concentric circles at the back, and we have to admit we really like the result. The phone is stylish without being overdesigned, with the unique profile and the pattern at the back bringing personality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic used reminds us of the Samsung Galaxy S II, which to this day remains one of the most stylish handsets. Asus however added its unique twist with the silver frame around the sides and some cool touches to the front panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only aspect of the Padfone 2's looks that we are not particularly thrilled about are the large bezels above and below the screen and the unexplainable gaps in the framing on both sides of the phone towards the bottom. It's the point where the two bits meet - but fail to align - which looks like poor craftsmanship, rather than a design accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even with those minor issues, the Padfone 2 is a good-looking phone, and one that provides a fresh alternative to those who may've started to get bored with the looks of recent Android smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smartphone controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We'll start with with the smartphone half of the Padfone 2 package. Above the screen you find the earpiece, flanked by the usual sensors on the left and the front-facing camera on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display you get a trio of capacitive controls: (from left to right) Back, Home and Task switcher. The keys' backlighting can be set to be active for 2 seconds or 10 seconds after use or you can opt for always on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the smartphone you get the power key and the volume rocker - both of those are large and have good tactile feedback. There's no camera button here, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Padfone 2 is completely bereft of controls or ports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm jack is in the center at the top of the phone, with the microSIM card slot nearby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom you get the microphone pinhole and the proprietary 13-pin port. This is actually a customized microUSB port, which enables data and video streaming both for the phone itself and for the docking station. This means you get MHL and USB host functionality if you buy the required adapters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though this is modified microUSB port, you can use regular microUSB cables for both data connections and charging. They don't fit very well though, so you have to be careful not to move things around too much to not get disconnected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, at the back you get the 13MP camera lens, the loudspeaker grille and the LED flash. The back panel can't be removed or replaced which means you get no access to the Padfone 2's 2140mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is said to last for up to 16 hours of telephony or 352 hours of stand-by, which sounded pretty promising and the actual performance didn't disappoint. We were surprised to see the Padfone 2 score a rating of 56h, meaning you would only need to charge it once every 56 hours if you do an hour of web browsing, an hour of talking and an hour of video watching per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You shouldn't forget either that you can use the Docking station as a charging pack, without turning the tablet on. It takes the station 2 hours and 15 minutes to fully charge a flat Padfone 2 battery and you can do it twice before you have to charge the Docking station itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Docking station controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 slides into its docking station effortlessly, but thanks to cleverly designed locks it fits firmly in place once it's there. Even if you turn the docking station upside down and shake it vehemently the smartphone won't fall off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The docking station itself packs a 10" screen, with a video-call camera sitting right below it. There's no need for another camera at the back as you can use the smartphone's 13 MP shooter when it's docked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top you get the power button, while the volume rocker is on the left side of the tablet body. Another 13-pin port sits at the bottom, while the back hosts the loudspeaker and the microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus has put a lot of effort into optimizing the audio output of that loudspeaker and it shows. The company has developed the SonicMaster technology together with Bang&amp;Olufsen. It's not quite perfect, but it's certainly better than just about every other tablet loudspeaker we have heard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 comes with a 4.7" Super IPS+ display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. This comes down to a pixel density of 312ppi - not quite as good as the recent wave of 1080p flagships, but the perceivable difference is minor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the smartphone boasts good brightness and great contrast, along with decently vibrant colors. The viewing angles are impressively wide and the overall image quality is generally very pleasing. Sunlight legibility turned out surprisingly good, as seen in the chart below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have seen slightly better (the HTC Butterfly, which we reviewed the other day springs to mind), but the Padfone 2 screen won't let users down. Besides, Asus claims that thanks to the technology used this is also one of the most responsive smartphone screens around having an average touch response time of 65ms, compared to Galaxy S III's 85ms and HTC One X's 75ms. Of course this is not the kind of difference you can feel in real life, but what's important is the Padfone2 is as responsive as a proper flagship smartphone should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The docking station is an entirely different story, though. With fullHD screens available on phones, 1280x800 pixels on a 10"display is bound to result in mediocre image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast of the screen is not bad and its colors are okay, but the pixilation is pretty obvious. After all, you when you slide the Padfone 2 in the docking station you gain more than four times the surface and yet you only get 80 extra pixels on one of the sides. The difference in the pixel sizes on the two screens is pretty big, as you can see in the two images below captured with our digital microscope.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Jelly Bean is in the driver's seat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 launched with Android Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box, but the company has since quickly pushed Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean to the smartphone and tablet combo. Confused about Android versions? Check out our Android version breakdown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Padfone 2 now enjoys the benefits of Project Butter, which keeps the framerate of animations at a constant 60 fps and delivers buttery smooth visuals. Combining the power of the four Krait cores and the latest-generation GPU, the Padfone 2 offers a virtually lag-free user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we've prepared a video tour of the Padfone 2's interface, including of course both phone and tablet demos. Check it out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus continues to rely on a nearly stock Android look and feel, keeping the launcher and most of the user interface untouched. Nevertheless, the company has provided some customizations here and there that enhance the experience, which we'll point out to you as we go along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a standard stock Android 4.1 Jelly Bean affair. There's a large dotted circle around the center-placed unlock button. You still get the two familiar shortcuts - move the unlock button to the left for camera, and right for unlock. There's a new, third icon above them for jumping straight into Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock at the bottom of the homescreen fits four custom shortcuts or folders. The center one always opens the app drawer, but the other four can be set to any shortcut or even a folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and manage homescreen panes - add, delete or just reorder them. You can have 7 panes at most, which are enough to fit plenty of content even if you use widgets that cover an entire pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In usual Jelly Bean fashion, widgets are resizable and make space for themselves by pushing app shortcuts and folders out of the way to make space for their larger size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus has been kind enough to include some custom widgets of their own including a task manager, number of unread emails, along with Weather and Battery widgets. The latter allows you to switch different power managing modes to get the most out of the battery. From there, you can also choose whether the Padfone 2 is charged when you slide it into the Padfone 2 station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick toggles have been added on separate rows giving you access to the settings menu, Wi-Fi networks and the special Asus Audio Wizard feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the actual quick toggle buttons themselves, allowing you to toggle Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mobile data (more can be added from the Settings menu). Asus is also giving the option to control the brightness and switch between normal and outside modes of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications can be expanded and collapsed with a two-finger swipe, and the top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders in Jelly Bean haven't been changed since Ice Cream Sandwich. A folder is created by dropping a shortcut on top of another and can be renamed by tapping on the "Unnamed folder" label. Opening a folder expands it only by as much as is needed to fit the icons inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer on the Padfone 2 consists of four rows of icons and three tabs (instead of the usual two). The new addition is the Pad Only tab, which shows you apps that are run only on the Padfone 2 Station. Unfortunately, the app drawer doesn't allow for custom viewing modes (alphabetical is the only one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's a Jelly Bean-style vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. A sideways swipe removes the app from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you slide the Padfone 2 into the Padfone 2 Station you get a full-fledged, 10.1" tablet. It's powered entirely by the smartphone's 1.5GHz Krait monster of a CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon unlocking the slate, you're greeted with the familiar Android interface. The homescreen configuration is quite reminiscent of Ice Cream Sandwich and features a top navigation bar which holds the usual three-button Android combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, Asus has added a fourth one - Floating widgets. Floating widgets are small, independent windows that are overlaid over anything else - the homescreen, regular full-screen apps, anything. You can fit two or three of those on the large 10.1" screen and they really improve the multitasking capabilities of the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Available Floating widgets include a calculator, calendar, email, dictionary, Asus' BuddyBuzz and the AudioWizard. If you don't intend to use any of those apps, you can always hide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the notification center in tablet mode is the same as the smartphone's and includes the handy quick settings toggles. The number of homescreens maxes out at seven, but that's enough space for all the widgets and app shortcuts you would need.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now shows what virtual assistants should be like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now was first introduced in Jelly Bean 4.1 and is definitely one of the most interesting additions to the OS. Simply put, it's Google's version of a personal assistant. Google Now is in the same neck of the woods as Apple's Siri, but it learns constantly from your use patterns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's accessed by swiping up on any of the three on-screen controls and gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work the same route every morning? Google Now will let you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office and will offer to re-route you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you with score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google constantly updates Google Now and in its latest version has become even smarter. If you allow it, the service can scan your email for upcoming flights, deliveries or restaurant reservations and let you know when they are due. There are also numerous kinds of cards like birthdays (yours and those of your contacts and friends in the Google+ social network) and what distance you've walked in a particular month. The last one could definitely feel creepy for some users, but it's easy to turn off from the Google Now settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made things faster as it's not dependent on the speed of your data connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in regards to accuracy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 is powered by what was until very recently the most powerful chipset in the Android camp and that's the Snapdragon APQ8064 Pro. The four Krait CPU cores in the Padfone 2 are clocked at 1.5GHz and are bundled with an Adreno 320 GPU and 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a truly powerful package, but no longer that uncommon as the Oppo Find 5, Nexus 4, HTC Butterfly and Xperia Z pack the same chipset. So, to come on top of the slew of similarly-spec'd droids out there, the Padfone 2 will depend on its clever use of resources and UI optimizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up in our battery of benchmark tests was BenchmarkPi, which tests the calculative performance of the individual processor cores. Here, the Padfone 2 comes on top of the high-end droid pack by the skin of its teeth, beating the benchmark heavyweight champion Xperia Z by just 2 miliseconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Padfone 2's march forward continues in Linpack, where multithreaded performance is put to the test. Here, the Padfone 2 also manages to beat the Xperia Z, but just barely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the compound benchmarks AnTuTu and Quadrant the Padfone 2 doesn't disappoint and ranks just as high as the other Krait-powered smartphones out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran GLBenchmark off-screen, which means we're testing at a fixed resolution for a more comparable gauge of its raw GPU power. The Padfone 2 aced this one as well, scoring 1 FPS higher than the Oppo Find 5 and a tad better than the Sony Xperia Z.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But most games will probably want to run at native resolution, so we're including Epic Citadel, which uses Unreal Engine 3. Unreal Engine is popular with mobile game makers, so it's a pretty important test. The benchmark was run at the High Quality setting and yet the Padfone 2 once again shined, posting an amazing result while pushing towards the 60fps cap of the benchmark throughout almost the entire test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The streak of the Asus Padfone 2 was interrupted once we moved to the browser trials of our benchmark series. We assume it's the stock Android browser's fault, as it's not the latest version available, but frankly, Google has been mostly focusing on the Chrome mobile browser for a while now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, scoring 1107ms in SunSpider isn't too shabby, considering the Xperia Z scored a lot less than that. In BrowserMark 2, however, things head further south - the Padfone 2 is last here - only ahead of the LG Optimus G, which has the same chipset and resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus has managed to squeeze all the performance the quad-core Krait has to offer. It did beat the similarly spec'd Xperia Z, topping the charts in most tests, but that's not such a big achievement considering the Z's 1080p display. Still, as it stands, the Padfone 2 is nothing short of an Android powerhouse.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook is the stock Android app, which hasn't been changed since its major redesign last year with the introduction of Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's made up of three tabs that you can switch between with sideways swipes. The middle tab is the default one, listing all of your contacts. Contacts are listed with a name and a picture to the right. They can be sorted by first or last name, and viewed as first name or last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's regular search as you type too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick contacts feature triggers on tapping a contact image to bring up a tabbed popup window. The tabs are phone and email with a list of the available numbers or addresses. These tabs can be navigated with sideways swipes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single contact view displays the contact's name along with a star to favorite a contact and a Settings button that lets you edit, share or delete a contact, as well assign custom ringtones to them or set the phone to redirect calls from that contact straight to voice mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under that is a list of all contact info sorted by category - phone numbers, emails, events, notes and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts that the phonebook displays can be filtered by service (e.g. hide all Facebook contacts) and even group (so you can hide all contacts that don't belong in a group, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two major tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is readily thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In-call quality was on the positive side. In spite of being acceptably loud, it tends to drop off in areas of spotty coverage. The secondary microphone for active noise cancellation of the Padfone 2 definitely helped it retain the quality of voice even in noisier environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features Asus-styled themes and, unlike stock Android, has grown a smart dialing feature, which is a must in every new smartphone of this day and age.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer is just the first tab of the phone app, the other two being the Call log and the Favorites tab (you get the same in the Phonebook). In the Call log, you can't delete individual entries, which was mildly annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus has built in a handwriting-based input for the dialer as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Asus Padfone 2. It scored a Average overall mark which means you might consider enabling vibration in noisier environments. The Padfone 2 Station, however, managed to score a bit higher than the Padfone 2, probably thanks to the bigger speakers inside it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual but with some improvements. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. A cool new feature is that you can select multiple threads to mass-delete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is presented as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them to prevent deletion. You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts work here too and there's a call shortcut at the top of the screen when viewing a thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the Padfone 2 to delete older messages (by default, it keeps 500 texts and 50 MMS). You can activate delivery reports and read reports too (they are notifications that the receiver has read the message).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a text is still frustrating as the text box starts off as a single line and grows only up to three lines, which makes working with longer texts hard. We mostly let it slide on previous versions, but with a 4.7" screen there's no excuse not to make the text box bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can use the full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has grown handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen but is mostly unchanged. It supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool new feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcuts on the bottom of the screen are new email, search, labels, refresh and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color-codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you would imagine the keyboard is pretty comfortable to use on the large 4.7" display of the Padfone 2. Keys get even bigger when you switch to landscape mode - the long screen becomes very comfortable for two-thumb typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you require even large keyboard, the Padfone 2 Station comes into play, as it provides a near full-size keyboard typing experience with its 10.1" display. However, holding the slate with two hands in an attempt to type may not be ideal for people with smaller hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus has an alternative method for text input dubbed Trace input. It works in a manner very similar to Swype -- you just Swipe your finger over the letters you want to type, lifting after each word is complete. Naturally, the Trace input typing feature benefits from the already existing Android word prediction, so you can just tap on the words the keyboard suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a "handle" attached to the text cursor - it's easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A double tap will bring up the select options - select word and select all - with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a word has a typo, it will be underlined in red and when you tap it, the phone will offer a number of suggested corrections along with options to add the word to the phone's dictionary or just delete it altogether.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery in Android 4.1 Jelly Bean retains its ICS looks and functionality. The Default view of the gallery is Albums, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is the 'Make available offline' feature - it lets you easily select multiple online albums and download them for offline viewing. The Gallery app supports online albums like Picasa (but not Facebook) and you can set it to sync photos only over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside an album, the photos are displayed in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to let you know you can't get further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single photo view is updated too - above the photo there are several sharing shortcuts and a delete button, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with even more options. The editor can be accessed via a small icon in the bottom left-hand corner and offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the intensity of the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app called Movie Studio handles video editing and it's quite feature-rich. You can add multiple videos to the timeline and trim their start and end points. You can also include titles and effects (including transitions), add music, and there are multiple options available when you decide to export the video (resolution, quality, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a great app that can completely eliminates the need for a more powerful computer-based video editor for most people. The same goes for the image editor too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock video player lacks DivX support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is still not getting the necessary attention from Google and there's still no dedicated videos app (you have to go through the Gallery). The Asus Padfone 2's default video player lacks support for either DivX or XviD codecs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player is quite limited in what it can do - you get play/pause and a slider to scrub through the video but that's it. Support for subtitles and .MKV files is also still missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Asus Padfone 2 plays very well, however, are .MP4 files. It didn't think twice about playing either 720p or 1080p full HD videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ideally, you will be better off with one of the many alternative video players on the Google Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At long last, Google implemented wireless video sharing to a Wi-Fi-enabled TV. The feature relies on good ol' DLNA technology to connect and the Miracast protocol for streaming. It's another feature most OEMs have offered for a while but it is only now that it's been integrated into the stock Android OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Music Player trails behind the competition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 comes with the latest stock Music app. It has the same side-scrollable tabs like most of the other Jelly Bean apps and comes with plenty of updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs let you organize your music library - there's Recent, Artists, Albums, Songs, Playlists and Genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets, as well a custom one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several 'Shop for artist' shortcuts sprinkled throughout the interface, which bring you to a Google search page with albums from the selected artist that you can buy from multiple online shops. There's even an option to look for nearby stores that have the album if you want a hard copy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is working, the lockscreen features the album art and track info for the current song along with simple playback controls. The notification area also lets you control the playback via an expandable notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 Station boasts what Asus calls SonicMaster speakers. The system comes with a specialized AudioWizard app, which lets you have different sound settings for different kinds of media: movie, music or games. We found that it does the trick of enhancing the bass of some video files.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone did well in our audio quality test. The smartphone posted mostly excellent scores in the first part of the test (active external amplifier), the only exception being intermodulation distortion. Still, it's not too bad and given the excellent volume levels we are willing to let that one go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With headphones plugged in, the intermodulation distortion rises a bit more, and stereo crostalk spikes significantly. Frequency response also worsened and volume levels dropped so the performance is hardly better than average on this occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the numbers and see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Feature-rich 13MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 features a 13MP auto-focus camera, which shoots stills of up to 4160 x 3120 pixels in 4:3 mode. There's also a 16:9 mode available, which produces shots with a resolution of up to 3360x1890. It's also capable of shooting 1080p videos at 30fps, as well as 720p at both 30fps and 60fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available camera settings are laid out across two sidebars. The left one holds a button to switch between video and image shooting and four shortcuts - camera mode selection, camera effects, resolution and exposure. The last, fifth, button is for the camera settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen there's a zoom slider, which is handy for quickly zooming in and out without having to access additional menus. The right half of the camera UI holds the front/rear camera toggle, flash settings, shutter and camcorder keys, as well as a gallery shortcut to see the last photo taken. Mind you, Asus has enabled the volume rocker to act as a shutter button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor sitting behind the camera protection glass is a Sony-made BSI with a 5-element lens and f/2.4 aperture. There's also a dedicated LED flash which is helpful in low light. There's also a dedicated image signal processor which helps the Padfone 2 shoot up to 100 continuous shots in burst mode thanks to the zero-lag shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of the Padfone 2 also offers an array of features and modes including Panorama, portrait and HDR. Asus has added an additional mode dubbed Beautification. Besides face detection, it's an advanced sort of facial recognition and lets you have some fun with eye enlargement effects as well as ski shine and post-process cheek blushing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the shots produced with the Padfone 2 was pretty good with plenty of resolved detail and nicely accurate colors. Noise levels were also pretty low, making this one of the better cameras out there. Alas, we didn't enjoy the best of weather these days, so the samples aren't as good as they could have been, but they still hint at the good potential the smartphone's camera has.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Solid video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 records 1080p and 720p videos at 30fps, as well as 720p at 60fps. It can also snap photos during video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored as .mp4 using the h.264 (Baseline Level 3 for 720p, Baseline Level 4 for 1080p) and records stereo audio at 160kbps, 48KHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous auto-focus is available here as well, but you can switch to Smart-AF, allowing you to set a single point using the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Padfone 2 managed to produce nicely detailed movies with accurate colors and next to no noise. Framerate was consistently high too, and if it wasn't for the unwillingness of weather gods to cooperate you would have certainly seen some of the best footage we have posted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the untouched 1080p video sample (0:30s, 71.5MB) video sample taken directly from the Asus Padfone 2. You can also download an untouched 720p video sample shot at 60 fps (0:03s, 15.7MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the top dog in the Asus' hand-held portfolio, the Padfone 2 features a wide array of connectivity options. Starting off with the basics, the phone packs a quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and penta-band 3G. The latter is backed by HSPA (42Mbps downlink, 5.76Mbps uplink). There's also support for 100 Mbps LTE if you are lucky enough to get that in your area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers a/b/g/n, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA are part of the package, of course. Wi-Fi Direct is a technology, which enables devices to connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty of it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology, two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to an eventual Bluetooth demise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board with support for Android Beam. With NFC you can share contacts, URLs, memos, messages, calendar events or even a call request to another NFC-enabled device or a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Padfone 2 also comes with a built-in A-GPS receiver that can rely on a digital compass and a barometer too (this helps get faster GPS locks).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For wired connections, the Padfone 2 utilizes its special, 13-pin USB port. Sadly, it doesn't come with support for mass storage, but it does support MTP, which is second best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thankfully, the Padfone 2 comes with USB on-the-go too, so You can hook up a USB flash drive and browse its contents. Pairing with a keyboard and a mouse isn't a problem, either. There's MHL support as well, allowing you to hook it up to an HDTV and is perfect for playing movies on the big screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android web browser is still great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The stock ICS browser has a streamlined interface, incognito browsing and other cool features. Since the Padfone 2 runs Jelly Bean, you can't sideload Flash support onto it. We weren't able to get YouTube videos to play in-page, and Flash games were a no-go as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser UI is quite minimalistic; all you get is the URL bar with a tabs shortcut. Hitting the Menu key you get more options - Refresh, Forward, Save to bookmarks, Share page, Find on page, full settings and a couple of more - Request desktop site (no more hunting for that "Desktop" option buried at the bottom of the site) and Save for offline reading. There's also a scrollbar on the right, which makes for going up and down easy, as well as quickly zooming to the top or bottom of the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search engine to Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser borrows several features from its desktop counterpart. For example, when searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result, it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster if you do click it. You can set this feature to work over Wi-Fi only to preserve data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, the tab switching interface looks exactly like the Recent apps list. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls (available from the Labs settings) reveal five controls (New tab, Tabs, URL, Bookmarks, More) when you slide your finger in from the left or right. Another cool feature from Labs is Full screen, which squeezes in a little more screen real estate by hiding the status bar.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 has the full version of the Polaris Office 4.0 suite for viewing and editing documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Polaris Office has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable and panning is blazing fast. You can edit a wide variety of settings and documents, and there's also cloud storage integration (Dropbox, Box and Google Drive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info about upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries but you can't edit them on the phone - they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch-optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can enable advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms) in either portrait or landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, as well as weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player. There's no world clock, stopwatch or timer though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Recorder app lets you create voice memos that you can save and listen to later.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>You are in good hands with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute and a half to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can enable the A-GPS to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will do if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage the cache of that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to fit New York and parts of the surroundings before Maps told us the area is too big. Another things is, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 runs Jelly Bean, so it has no problems accessing all of the latest apps. The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There are usually several screenshots of the app in action, and oftentimes a demo video as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Google Play Store and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.), so if you wish you could do something more with your phone, odds are it's in the app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 is a fine example of the kind of out-of-the-box thinking we like to see from more manufacturers. The hybrid is a unique concept which makes so much sense that we wonder why more OEMs haven't explored it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only do you get access to your files and apps at all times without having to use any kind of sync service or install them twice, but you will also enjoy the power of the Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset and its 4 Krait cores and network connectivity on both devices without paying extra for it. Of course, you obviously cannot use both devices simultaneously, but unless you plan on sharing, that's a non-issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual execution of the idea has also been notably improved with the second generation Padfone. The hybrid is now properly powered, it's lighter and looks more stylish than its predecessor, and allows you to switch between the two displays much faster. We also like the Zenbook-inspired design much better. The upgraded camera also makes a difference and the new spring system makes sure everything remains locked firmly in place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, if you look at the two pieces of the combo separately there is certainly a lot of room for improvement. First and most important, a tablet with so much power definitely deserves a better screen. The modest resolution can't fully take advantage of the monstrous chipset and give you the high-res gaming experience that S4 Pro devices are known to deliver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing is the non-expandable storage, which means you'll need to at least get the 32GB version (it's the most widely available, too). You could probably live with 16GB on a 720p smartphone, but the fact that you carry the tablet apps with you at all times makes it insufficient for the hybrid device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone 2 itself a brilliant smartphone, but the recent onslaught of 1080p flagship sees it slide down the food chain. Costing as much as the newly unveiled HTC One, the Asus flagship simply cannot match the 1080p monster in any of the key aspects (even though it probably holds an advantage in camera quality).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So is this a disappointing end to a story with such a promising beginning? Not really - the Padfone 2 is just a case where the whole is better than the sum of its parts. You have to be one of those who need both a tablet and a smartphone to be interested in the Padfone, but if you go for it you'll be getting value for money. Hard to believe? Let's have a look at a couple of alternative tablet and smartphone combos that you can get right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An Asus MeMo Pad Smart is about ?340 for the 16GB Wi-Fi only option and while its Tegra 3 chipset won't match the S4 Pro in performance it should offer a tablet experience similar to that of the Padfone 2 docking station. After that you'll have to go for the cheapest quad-core smartphone out there - currently, the LG Optimus 4X HD - to fit within the Padfone 2 budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on how important it is for you to be able to use the two devices simultaneously, you might find the deal worth it, but you should know that both the tablet and the smartphone experience are a step backwards from the Asus offering. You'd be losing network connectivity on the slate and the better camera, more capable chipset, and Jelly Bean on the smartphone. Plus after the waste of space needed for two separate Android installations and all the apps twice you will actually have far less storage available for your media (which you'll need to sync back and forth all the time, too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Optimus 4X HD P880 ? Asus Memo Pad ME172V</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get the cheaper Nexus 7 to compliment a more capable smartphone, but a 7" tablet and near-5" smartphone make little sense to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Google Nexus 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternately, if you happen to live in a country where the Google phone I available at the Play Store, you can opt for a Nexus 4 and Nexus 10, which will be the ultimate combo - and one with great pedigree too. They both have powerful chipsets so you won't be missing much in terms of performance, and the tablet screen is vastly superior to that of the Padfone 2 docking station. You will need to spend nearly ?700 to get 32GB of storage on those two combined, though, and again you will actually have far less of that left for your personal files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't have a devices section of the Play Store in the country where you live, this deal is hardly in the same league as it will run you over ?1000.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Nexus 4 E960 ? Samsung Google Nexus 10 P8110</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So at the end of the day the Asus Padfone 2 will only cater for the needs of a specific group of people, but it will do so quite well. And as tablets continue to gain popularity, a combo like this will only be getting a bigger field to play in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus needs to play its part too. The company has already shown that it can release timely updates, so we are hoping Android 4.2 won't take long to hit the Padfone 2. We'd also like to see them convince more developers to update their apps to support the seamless Dynamic display transition from phone to tablet and vice versa.</paragraph>
