			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 is new territory for LG to conquer and the LG E900 Optimus 7 is their first pawn in the game. However ?pawn? hardly describes the rich feature set of this player. LG has done its best to set the Optimus 7 apart with great build quality and some subtle but useful software perks. With the strict hardware restrictions imposed by Microsoft, it?s really hard to make you product stand out and we hope the LG attempt turns out successful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You must?ve heard of the strict Redmond rules outlining the hardware requirements of their latest mobile OS. Not that demanding excellence is a bad thing ? but manufacturers are under a lot of strain to make their phones unique while keeping within the Microsoft-imposed guidelines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with any other WP7 smartphone, the Optimus 7 specs leave little doubt that it?s a high end gadget. But Windows Phone 7 brings with it a certain trade-off ? you can bet that the hardware is top notch but the platform-specific limitations may or may not prove to be dealbreakers for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the pros and cons of the LG E900 Optimus 7, which will give you a good idea of how well LG did in that task.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WP7-specific limitations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG has added a handful of apps that give their Windows Phone 7 some unique capabilities. First off, the PlayTo app gives the phone DLNA capabilities ? so far exclusive in the Windows Phone 7 world. The Panorama shot application adds a useful feature to the stock WP7 camera. And finally, there?s Scan Search, a augmented reality app that can give you a weather forecast as well as find you the best cafe nearby ? by using your smartphone camera viewfinder as a guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus 7 has a smaller LCD unit than the top dogs in the WP7 game but it will try to compensate with a proper price tag. Plus we find a 3.8-inch display to be on the brink of tipping over our usability scale.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price tag will always be a decider but with Windows Phone 7 there?s one important difference. Given the hardware requirements, you can?t really expect to buy any of those phones cheap. You?ll be getting roughly the same package in the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having reviewed a WP7 phone before, we knew almost exactly what to expect the second we opened the box. Hit the next page where we try to find out what makes the LG E900 Optimus 7 different from the rest.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The box of the LG E900 Optimus 7 contains the basics and you don?t get any extras. There?s the microUSB cable, the charger (which works with the USB cable) and a one-piece headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s the usual set of user guides and that?s it. The Optimus 7 does have 16GB of built-in memory, which does add to the value.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG E900 Optimus 7 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG E900 Optimus 7 measures 125 x 59.8 x 11.5 mm and weighs 157 grams ? it?s not a small phone by any means. Still, it has rock-solid build, which is exactly what many people are looking for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We always approve of a metal chassis and the LG E900 Optimus 7 really delivers. It has both round corners and right angles ? a subtly elegant and neutral look. The Optimus 7 is neither purely a geek?s phone nor a strictly business device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the LG E900 Optimus 7 spans 3.8? and has WVGA resolution. That puts it at the lower end of WP7 screens (the smallest of the current generation is 3.6? and the biggest is 4.3?). But among all touchscreen sizes, it?s actually above average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is a TFT LCD unit and suffers from common LCD problems ? glowing blacks and poor image quality when viewed at an angle. Still, the high-res screen has pleasing colors and response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is about average ? the main problem is that the screen reflects too much light, which sometimes subjectively makes the on-screen colors look washed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the touchscreen, the front panel of the LG Optimus 7 also features the earpiece, which doubles as the loudspeaker, as well as the proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, there are the three keys mandated by Windows Phone 7 ? Back, Windows and Search. The Windows key protrudes and feels rather cheap, while the other two keys are nicer and made of matte plastic. The three keys are big enough and comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of LG E900 Optimus 7 houses only the volume rocker, which is flush against the side of the phone and not very easy to use. On the right, we find the microUSB port (which is covered with a protective flap) and the camera shutter key. The microUSB port is used both for charging and data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the 3.5mm standard audio jack (left uncovered) along with the Power/Lock key. The power key is slightly raised though a bit too small. It?s still ok to use and accidental presses are unlikely. Plus, the shutter key can be set to unlock the phone and launch the camera if you need to act fast and not miss the right moment to snap a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing to note at the bottom of the LG Optimus 7 is the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going around back, there?s the 5MP auto-focus camera with LED flash and a self portrait mirror. The camera lens is slightly recessed and that?s the only protection against scratches it has. At the bottom end of the back is the battery cover latch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the latch releases the back cover, which has a nice brushed metal feel to it. Underneath is the beefy 1500mAh Li-Ion battery, LG don?t quote any standby and talk times but in our experience, the battery proved reasonably good ? we could get a couple of days out of it with medium to heavy usage. Just above the battery compartment is the SIM card bed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is made of actual metal ? and not just a thin sheet either. The rest of the phone is constructed with durability and comfort in mind too. That adds to the overall weight, but anyway the last thing we need in a phone like the LG E900 Optimus 7 is a cheap plastic feeling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice curves of the phone made it very comfortable to hold, though it might prove too big/heavy for your pocket. The matte plastic on the front and the brushed metal at the rear are great at hiding fingerprints. It?s only the finish of the protruding silver-colored Windows key that seems likely to succumb to the daily wear and tear.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Paving the homescreen with Live tiles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG E900 Optimus 7 is the second Windows Phone 7 mobile we?ve reviewed and we have a review of just the OS. So, if you?re curious about the OS rather than a specific phone you should check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, October 7, 2011: The Windows Phone 7.5 update is out and it brings new functionality and resolves some of the issues that we've mentioned in this review. Check out our Windows Phone 7.5 review here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software part of Windows Phone 7 reviews feels like a book you?ve read ? that?s because all WP7 phones run the exact same software, with just a couple of preinstalled apps that make some difference. So don?t get surprised that we?ve reused some texts from our previous Windows Phone 7 reviews. We want you to be sure that even when we reuse portions of the texts, we always take care to check our facts with the review unit thoroughly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s a good strategy ? Microsoft?s rules mean that each and every Windows Phone 7 device will be very, very similar to the rest regardless of manufacturer. The basic software and user interface are fixed, at most each manufacturer can preload a few extra apps on their device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the case of the Optimus 7, those include a panorama shooting app, a Layar-like augmented reality app and DLNA connectivity. The rest is almost exactly the same as you would expect (though the Marketplace surprised us, more on that later). The camera app has grown Intelligent shot and Beauty shot capabilities too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old Today screen has gone the way of the dinosaurs and it won?t be missed ? the new homescreen is one of the most flexible ones we?ve seen. You?ll notice just how many useful things you can put on it as this review goes on. The iconic Start menu is gone too and there?s no trace of honeycombs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the look of the new interface ? the negative comments about it stem from the fact that the Metro UI doesn?t look very good in static screenshots. You really have to see it on video in order to appreciate the smoothness, graphics and animations provided by the design team. Despite the lack of shadows and 3D volume to the UI elements, the interface is in no way dull.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone 7 Metro UI has two main parts that live side by side ? the homescreen (referred to as ?Start?) and the main menu. You can switch between the two by sideways swipes or using the arrow button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is a square grid of Live tiles. Live tiles fit the broad concept of ?widget? but, unlike most widgets out there, they are very uniform with clear labels that indicate what each one of them does. They also show some quick info (e.g. number of messages, the date) but they are also the Windows Phone 7 equivalent of homescreen shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color theme of the interface is customizable ? the background can be dark or light and the color of the elements (e.g. the fill color of Live tiles) can be any one from a long list of available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is a traditional list ? this is where all the hubs and installed apps are listed in alphabetical order. A press and hold reveals a context menu, which lets you ?pin? items to the homescreen (that is put their Live tile there) along with uninstall and also rate and review the app (if it?s an installed app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no folders in the main menu ? so the more apps you install, the longer the list will get. This could make finding rarely used apps quite a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is quite simple ? sideways swipes navigate a sort of tabbed interface and there are on-screen soft keys. This will covers the most commonly used features, but for advanced features you can tap the ?...? symbol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It opens an extended context menu (and also reveals a label under each soft key, if the icon wasn?t descriptive enough). A press and hold on an item will reveal a menu to manipulate just one item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What Windows Phone 7 has lost since the 6th iteration is multitasking. It handles a lot like a pre version 4 iOS. The Start key (the one with the Windows logo) gets out of the app and brings up the homescreen. Alternatively, you can exit an app using the Back key. That gets you back to the app last used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That last app will continue from exactly the same point from where you left it. Getting back into an app is done by tapping its live tile or shortcut in the menu or by using the back button, which returns to the previous screen (even if it was from a completely different app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no ?recently used? type of list to make going back to the app you need easier ? so you might have to search for it in the main menu or keep hitting back until you see it. So, no multitasking is not a complete loss, but not quite as comfortable as true multitasking OSes either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, lack of multitasking means you can?t, say, run third party music players (e.g. last.fm) in the background. A curiosity is that apps (in general, not just music players) can continue to work even after you lock the screen ? but you have to allow it. The phone will ask permission the first time you start the app and later you can change that setting from the app?s menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft will lift that restriction, but only for the apps that prove battery-efficient ? the phone must be able to work at least 6 hours with the app running if it?s a music player and 120 hours otherwise. They didn?t specify what their test phone is though (not even battery capacity).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, all the other apps get suspended when you lock the phone ? unlocking the phone will cause the app or game to reload, which can be slow and you usually lose your progress. This can be very annoying even to casual gamers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook for all your friends<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People hub takes on the responsibilities of the phonebook, but calling it a ?phonebook? is not very accurate. Instead of contacts, you have people with profiles ? a term taken right out of social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends ? everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and they can be displayed as ?First Last? or ?Last, First? (the two settings are separate), you can also include or exclude Facebook friends, import only Facebook contacts that have a phone number and add several accounts to sync with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side shows only new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recently called contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact?s profile shows the contact photo. Below that there are actions ? ?call mobile?, ?text mobile?, ?write on wall?, ?view website? and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the ?What?s new? panel?, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good, but there?s no smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The signal reception with the LG E900 Optimus 7 was OK, though it did drop a call when we tried it in an area of poor coverage. The in-call sound was clear though not as loud as we would have liked, even at the loudest setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video calls are no-go though ? at least not using the 3G video call standard. You?d need a dedicated app to do that and there aren?t any just yet (this should change very soon though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets ? a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Optimus 7 did fairly well recognizing our commands, though it did have issues separating the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name "Mandark".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist ? it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What?s missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone ? a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an incoming call, the contact?s photo will appear full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note ? status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the LG E900 Optimus fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. Bear in mind that though it didn't score high, its sound is really smooth and nice to listen to, so the number doesn't tell the whole story.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of Windows Phone 7 uses threaded view to organize your messages. When you start the app, you?ll see a list of conversations ? each conversation consists of multiple messages visualized as speech bubbles, which are ordered by the time they were sent/received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An empty speech bubble will hang at the bottom waiting for you to type a response. A message can have multiple recipients too by using the + button next to the recipient field. Just the first few letters of the contact?s name are needed ? the search feature will find it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can attach a photo to turn the message into an MMS ? either an existing photo or you can snap a new one. You can add only one though and you can only attach photos (not videos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email app is pretty good. It easily found the settings for our Gmail and Hotmail test accounts. Each inbox is separate and you can pin it to the homescreen, though there?s no aggregated inbox view sadly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to display all, unread or flagged messages ? by sweeps to the side and you can browse all folders for the email account and batch operations are easy ? a tap on the left side of the screen selects the message, so you can move it, mark it as (un)read or flag it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each message can be flagged, which is a great way to pick out only the emails that are important right now ? just tap the ?toggle flag? option from the context menu when you?re done with them and they are off the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried emailing a photo from the Optimus 7's camera, but the email app downscaled it before sending - so, emailing full resolution shots is no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is a traditional virtual QWERTY with not too many surprises. It can suggest words as you type and correct spelling and also auto-capitalize letters after a full stop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The responsiveness was great and the spell correction turned out to be very accurate ? we were able to type very fast with very little practice. The overall experience was very positive and even heavy texters will be quite satisfied.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A speech-to-text feature is planned for messages and emails, which will let you dictate a message instead of typing it out. This wasn?t available on our test unit though, so we couldn?t test it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is full of eye-candy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub is the photo gallery of Windows Phone 7. When you start it, it shows the most recent photos (including those from the camera), What?s new (which shows photos from online services) and a menu, which lets you view all photos, photos sorted by date and your favorite photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing an individual photo supports pinch zooming and you can easily upload the photo to Facebook or share it on some other service. There?s an option to automatically strip geo-tagging information before uploading it to online services ? that way your offline album will still be geo-tagged, but you won?t have to worry about privacy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub will automatically pull photos from your SkyDrive, Windows Live and Facebook accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve had no issues with speed ? Microsoft?s minim spec requirement guarantees that even 5MP photos are handled without a snag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even so, Microsoft has decided to downscale photos when they are transferred from a computer to the phone using the Zune software (much like emailing a photo).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music and video player, the Zune way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music and video players are simple and have straightforward interfaces. You won?t have any difficulties using them. However there are some things missing, like equalizers. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger ? you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the album art temporarily reveals three buttons ? repeat, favorite and shuffle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The players can of course work in the background and there?s another nice shortcut ? when you press a volume key, the name of the currently playing track also appears along with play/pause, next and previous buttons (they can also scrub through the song).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen ? like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn?t recognize .AVI files ? in other words, don?t expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 ? so, you can watch those formats on the E900 Optimus 7, it?s just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer configuration).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG E900 Optimus 7 also has a built in FM radio with a dead simple interface. You have the current frequency in very large digits ? swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you use the LG E900 Optimus 7 with an active external amplifier (such as your home or car's stereo) it provides really clean audio output. It got excellent scores in our test, save for the intermodulation distortion, which is only average. In those scenarios the Optimus 7 will easily rival any competitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However when you plug in a pair of headphones the stereo crosstalk skyrockets so high that it almost sounds like a mono device. The rest of the readings are unaffected by the increased resistance and the handset remains decently loud but the flaw is still big enough to ruin the overall score.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG E900 has a 5MP autofocus camera and LED flash. Still images have a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels, while videos go up to 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple ? you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We rarely get surprised by camera UI but Microsoft has managed to pull out another nice UI stunt here as well. A side slide to the right opens the last picture shot and a slide to the right brings back the camera's live view instantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended settings have been modified a bit ? the LG logo is clearly visible along with the Intelligent shot and Beauty shot modes. The rest of the settings include everything from flash and auto-focus modes, to image settings (contrast, white balance, etc.), effects, shake reduction and other options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly the camera key will wake the phone with a single press ? that is unlock it and start the camera. But that feature cleverly doesn?t trigger if there?s something in front of the proximity sensor ? like the insides of your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Optimus 7 camera is above average for the 5MP class. There?s quite a bit of noise and the noise reduction algorithm takes away from the fine details. The camera didn?t always get the exposure right and some photos showed a slight bluish tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the camera is good enough to depend on if you didn't bring over your dedicated camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried out Intelligent shot too, but we weren?t very impressed with the results. Their effects weren?t very noticeable, so you?d be better off doing manual adjustments in your image editing app of choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also gave the Panorama shot app a go. The stitching wasn?t perfect and individual photos had varying white and color balance, which resulted in color bands (especially visible in the sky, which goes from blue to purplish and back to blue between stitches).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app takes a maximum of 5 shots and has no settings besides zoom. You take the first photo by pressing the shutter but the rest are snapped automatically. There?s a visual guide that will help you properly align each photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Panorama photo taken with the LG E900 Optimus 7 and the Panorama shot app </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: we received a second Optimus 7 unit that came without the Panorama shot app ? if you don?t have it preinstalled, you can easily grab it from the LG apps store (for free, of course).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the LG E900 Optimus 7 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. You can see how the LG E900 Optimus 7 image quality compares to that of some of the other handsets we have reviewed. Clicking any of the following three images will take you to our dedicated page for some pixel-peeping pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera does 720p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can record in three resolutions ? QVGA, VGA or 720p. The camera defaults to VGA, which is frustrating ? if you forget to set it to 720p, the videos you thought were shot in HD will be at the much less impressive VGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While 720p sounds great, the reality is a little underwhelming. Videos are recorded in .MP4 file format but the bitrate doesn?t seem enough. The amount of captured detail and colors are OK but there are noticeable compression artifacts (or possibly upscaling artifacts). The frame rate hovers around 23 frames per second, though it drops when there?s heavier motion in the scene, resulting in some choppiness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an LG E900 Optimus 7 video sample: 720p@25fps.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The LG E900 Optimus 7 was also included in our Video Compare Tool database. Check it out ? the tool?s page includes a quick walkthrough on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG E900 Optimus 7 in the Video Compare Tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a 720p video sample from our new test setup. Pay attention to the second half of the video where we lower the light to show you how the the camcorder performs in more challenging conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity misses Mass storage mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity on the LG E900 Optimus 7 covers all the bases ? world-trotting quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and fast tri-band 3G with 7.2Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA support (via the PlayTo app) and Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP. Bluetooth is currently limited as to what it can do ? there?s no file transfer support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing with a computer is done with the Zune app. It supports syncing over USB and Wi-Fi. It?s the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your Optimus 7 ? Windows Phone 7 doesn?t support Mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you have a Mac don?t worry ? the WP7 Connector for Mac will cater Mac computer users with a Windows Phone 7 mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another syncing option is the cloud. SkyDrive is a free Microsoft service that gives you 25GB cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Best Internet Explorer yet, but we wanted Silverlight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer is the browser many people love to hate, but the Windows Phone 7 version of Microsoft?s web browser is very good. It?s fast and easy to use ? a huge step forward from Internet Explorer Mobile 6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Page rendering is perfect and fast, as are panning and scrolling. For zoom, you have double tap and pinch zoom. As an extra guide for navigation there?s the Find on page option. Flipping the phone in landscape orientation clears the onscreen controls and gives the whole screen to the webpage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple tabs are supported and the E900 Optimus 7 didn?t break a sweat juggling several of them. This is of course thanks to the high hardware specs ? which are guaranteed for each Windows Phone 7 device. There is a six-tab maximum limit though ? reasonable for a mobile device, but tab-power users may find it limiting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>History and favorites are supported and you can even pin a favorite site to the homescreen. Another handy option is to let Bing suggest sites as you type in the URL and Internet Explorer will also suggest sites from the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some things missing though ? Flash is one, but we were at least hoping for Silverlight, which didn?t work either. Saving files is problematic too ? you can only save files that the OS can handle. Text reflow is another feature we missed ? if you zoom in as much as possible to make fonts readable, you?ll have to pan left and right to read the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.8? WVGA screen on the LG Optimus 7 provides a good browsing experience. The resolution is enough for browsing the desktop versions of sites and the 3.8 inches are adequate screen real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is usually the place where we mention YouTube ? on the WP7 the support is rather limited. The current YouTube app in the Marketplace just launches the browser and directs it to the mobile YouTube site. Not any more useful than a bookmark. And the desktop version is no-go of course.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Task-oriented organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar prefers two view modes ? agenda and day view. You have month view too, but you can?t access it by side-swiping ? you need to use the soft key for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two softkeys are Today (brings you to the current date) and Add an appointment. That?s the only type of event you get, but it has enough options to suit your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple calendars, including our Google Calendar but we had to add it as an Outlook (ActiveSync) account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set multiple alarms ? each with its own name, ringing sound and repeat pattern. We set up ten and yet the add alarm button didn?t grey out ? the Optimus 7 can handle more alarms than we know what to do with. There?s a basic calculator too, which has big, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mobile office is better than ever, still not perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Office hub is an important part of the Windows Phone 7 package. The interface is identical to the other hubs and it?s the best mobile Office suite we?ve seen yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections ? OneNote, Documents and SharePoint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft?s collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you?re done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you?d need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let?s look at the two most important apps ? Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported. PowerPoint files live in the Documents section too ? but they are for viewing only, you can?t edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Word file support is very good. When reading a file, you can tap the Outline key to view a list of all titles from the document. The other way for navigating long files is the Find key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s undo and redo options but strangely, there?s no way to create lists, like in OneNote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the biggest missing feature is copy and paste. That?s a huge miss for a document editor ? you can?t copy and paste parts of other documents, emails, messages, sites, nothing. We?re guessing many people will sooner or later find this omission quite frustrating. Microsoft will be fixing that in early 2011.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel viewer/editor is pretty good too, but like the Word editor it misses some features. You can add formulas to cells (though it?s not as easy as on the desktop Excel and there are fewer cells available), you can sort and filter the cells too, even merge some of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But cell formatting is limited to date, money or percentages. You can?t even change the currency sign. Another must-have missing is row and column insertion. Several sheets are supported but you get three by default and you can?t rename or delete them, nor add new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft?s fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other interesting apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the Bing website, there are new photos every day to serve as a background, but WP7 has one extra ? three squares on the photo, which give you three interesting facts about what?s in the picture. The copyright sign in the bottom right also reveals the location of the photo (e.g. ?Waterfall on the Arroyo del Salto River?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not useful per se, but it?s a nice ?Did you know...?? type of feature for the curious-minded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like any other Windows Phone 7, LG Optimus 7 has extensive voice recognition capabilities ? you just press and hold the Windows key and say your command. You can do things like ?Call Sarah at work?, ?Open calendar? and even ?What can I say?? if you?re not sure what commands you can give. It wasn?t very good at recognizing our commands though, hopefully it will improve with time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive is Microsoft?s cloud storage service and they offer 25GB of free storage (individual files must be 50MB max). You can integrate it with desktop Windows Explorer and it has some integration with Windows Phone 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right now, you can upload photos including auto uploading of all pictures you snap with the camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG apps do DLNA, augmented reality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG E900 Optimus 7 comes with three special apps preinstalled by LG ? PlayTo, ScanSearch and Panorama shot (which we already covered).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PlayTo turns the Optimus 7 into a DLNA server ? it can play pictures, videos and music on compatible TVs and computers. It?s subject to some limitations ? it?s a server only, that is, you can?t play content from your home server on the phone, and DRM-protected files won?t work. Still, this is a unique feature in the land of WP7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ScanSearch is an augmented reality app similar to Layar. It uses the camera and your location to overlay information about various points of interest. It uses the compass, so when you turn the phone in the direction of a POI it appears on the screen ? you can set the radius for the search and what to look for (cafes, banks, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can pull data from either Google or Bing (Google seems to have more info) Tapping on a POI shows its About page and also info on what else is nearby. You can also search for a place by name and set the center for the search somewhere other than your current location (though the UI for that isn?t very good).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature of ScanSearch is a sort of radar view ? tilt the phone so it?s parallel to the ground, and instead of using the compass to look around, you get a top-down view of the points of interest around you. You can pan around to view items further away. Tilting it to the sky brings up a weather forecast instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Official Twitter app is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While it didn?t come preinstalled on the LG E900 Optimus 7, the official Twitter app should be one of your first downloads from the Marketplace. Windows Phone 7 is heavily geared towards social networking and Twitter is one of the biggest networks right now, so you can count it among the essential apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app was released only recently and not all kinks have been worked out, but from what we?ve seen so far it?s great. You can add several accounts, but only one can be signed in at a time and their timelines are kept separate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Twitter app, you can view your timeline (yours and your friends? tweets are intermingled here), @mentions, direct messages and lists. For each tweet you have the option to reply or retweet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app kept track of our hashtags and @usernames so they were easy to add to the tweet. Adding a photo (either from the gallery or snapping one on the spot) was easy too ? and the app offers to upload it to Twitter-friendly photo sharing site (TwitPic, TweetPhoto or yFrog). You can geo-tag tweets too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some major things that need to be fixed though ? right now, there?s no integration with the People hub (so people?s tweets won?t show up in their contact info), the Live tile for the app is static (it could, say, display number of new tweets) and there?s no way to automatically shorten links before you send out your tweet. But for an early version the Twitter app is very good and highly usable too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Twitter client on the LG E900 Optimus 7 will also feature the voice-to-text capability as in the messaging department. That too wasn?t available on our test unit though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps is capable and simple to use<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG E900 Omnia 7 comes with a built in GPS receiver and it was fast to acquire a lock and kept a strong reception. A-GPS is available and it speeds things up, but there?s no way to turn it off (it requires some data connection to do its magic).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing Maps for mobile is the in-house application that Microsoft has prepared for use on their Windows Phone 7 smartphones. You can view either the regular map or switch to aerial view, which brings up the satellite imagery. Unfortunately, the cool Bird?s eye view isn?t available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, when you zoom in down to street level, Bing maps automatically switches to satellite imagery, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three softkeys available are for directions, my location and search. The extended menu has options to clear the map of any markers you?ve placed, toggling aerial view and accessing the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the map is easy and relatively fast. Zooming is done by pinching, and for a bit of eye candy when new tiles are loaded they fade in smoothly instead of just popping up. Overall the effect is looks much smoother than on Google Maps for Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold places the marker on a specific location ? tap the marker and you get About (a map screenshot and the address, which you can send over a message or email) and Nearby, which shows nearby POI with a rating and basic info (like a phone and a web site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get Directions from my location button, which will find step by step instructions to get you to your destination by either driving or walking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for what?s missing ? there?s no Navigate from here option, which can be quite useful. For example, you?re going to the theater, but want to check how far away the restaurant you?re going to afterwards is from the theater.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still do that, but you can?t pick it from the map ? you have to use the search to find that location. Another thing ? you can?t add more than one destination when planning the route (Google Maps can?t do that either though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there was no trace of voice guided navigation either, even though Windows Mobile 6.x can do it. That?s another thing that 2011 is expected to bring, though it hasn?t been confirmed officially.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Marketplace lets you try before you buy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace has gotten a few tweaks since we last saw it. It?s organized into four main sections ? applications, games, music and the LG apps store. A fifth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update ? there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it?s on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, Top, New, Free and finally, Categories which has the games sorted into genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too ? new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (it?s 15 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections ? so, songs get mixed in with the apps and games. This is a little annoying since you don?t need song results while searching for an app and vice versa. But still, it?s not a major problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of apps is growing fast (it passed the 1000 apps in three weeks) and some key apps are already available ? like the official Twitter app for example. The option to install a trial version for a game or app has been added and it?s very convenient ? how much you get to play depends on the individual developer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the LG apps store, it currently contains only 6 apps, all of which are free. The plan for now is to populate it with exclusive, free apps. Better still ? for 60 days, you?d be able to download 10 apps worth 30 US dollars, with new apps replacing the old after that period runs out (you get to keep what you?ve downloaded though). Apps developed by LG will be available for free ? if you buy the Optimus 7, you?ll never experience a shortage of apps (and very rarely have to pay for one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is the same and each page bears the LG logo, but will show related content from the general Marketplace too, which might show a better alternative outside the LG apps store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox Live invites your friends over for a game<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox ? from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests ? which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there?s a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live ? the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace. We didn?t have many games to test, but the beefy hardware requirements ensure that Windows Phone 7 handsets won?t have any problems with complex games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The WindowsPhone.Live.com cloud has a silver lining<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has added extensive support for ?in the cloud? features in Windows Phone 7. The WindowsPhone.Live.com site is where you can access those features from your browser ? everything from remote wipe to browsing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Open the site in your browser and sign in with the Live ID that you use on your WP7 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once that?s done you have access to the Find My Phone features. You can make the phone ring or see its last location on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it turns out that your phone is lost, you can lock it and leave a ?please return? note on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you fear it?s been stolen, you can remote wipe it too (which erases all data from the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Live also lets you browse and edit contacts, calendar events and OneNotes too (those are edited with Office Live).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also browse photos you?ve uploaded to SkyDrive. We already mentioned that the camera of every WP7 phone can be set to automatically upload all pics you snap there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of SkyDrive, using Windows Live Mesh you can sync your computer with your SkyDrive account too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is only the second Windows Phone 7 device we?ve reviewed but we?re already getting a clear picture of what we can expect. The main differentiator will be the hardware, with minor perks included in the software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG E900 Optimus 7 is solidly built with a high-end spec sheet. In the face of the WP7 competition, it?s more or less an equal. That works both ways though ? there isn?t much that the non-QWERTY Windows Phone 7 mobiles have to offer that the Optimus 7 doesn?t have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the DLNA feature of Optimus 7 is likely to remain unique for a while as Microsoft has put tight restrictions on Windows Phone 7 software (so no third-party app can do it). The Panorama app and signature LG Intelligent and Beauty shot modes along with the LG apps store that promises free apps are good perks on the software side too. That speech-to-text feature sounds great as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s hard to compare phones when they are so alike but here are a couple phones that the LG Optimus 7 needs to watch out for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 has a slightly bigger screen, but more importantly it?s SuperAMOLED and offers a much better image quality. It comes in 8GB and 16GB varieties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 ? HTC Trophy</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Trophy has a 3.8? S-LCD screen though its internal memory is just 8GB (and there?s no microSD card slot). We haven?t seen the Trophy yet, but our initial impressions from the Desire Z and Desire HD S-LCD screens imply that the display quality can hardly be a differentiator between the Trophy and the Optimus 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, there?s the iPhone (3GS and 4) and the various high-end Android phones. Those are not yet in direct competition with Windows Phone 7 though ? people who buy the first WP7 phones like the LG Optimus 7 are ones that want a high-end phone and a new OS experience with excellent social networking and Office integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the Optimus 7 delivers. Its success is tied up with the success of its OS. The LG E900 Optimus 7 is a solid effort and its place as one of the premier Windows Phone 7 mobiles is well deserved.</paragraph>
