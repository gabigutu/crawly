			<paragraph>Sirocco is currently the most expensive Nokia model on the market. It has a sapphire protecting glass and glossy steel panels; among its standard accessories are a leather case, two batteries, a earphone, a Bluetooth handsfree, and a cleaning cloth. Apparently, future owners of Nokia 8800 Sirocco will be happening to rarely run one into another if ever: the reason? Nokia 8800 Sirocco costs a good deal of money.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Nokia 8800 Sirocco</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rich managers in gleaming limousines, celebrities, businessmen, directors and all kinds of important social figures need toys, and, out of principal, these are usually supposed to be expensive. Nokia is one of the mobile manufacturers that has been constantly meeting such requirements for plenty of years now, launching one model after another within the so called 8-line. You surely remember the 8910 model as well as the following improved one 8910i; two years later Nokia 8800 hit the market. Today we?ve got a new jewel - Nokia 8800 Sirocco Edition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Like a bottle of exquisite wine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Nokia 8800 Sirocco is wrapped up just like a highly expensive bottle of wine: in a black box made of solid cardboard, whose top is held by a silver clip with the polished number 8800 and the words Sirocco Edition. In the first level of the box I found a flint-paper brochure assuring the new owner how bright their idea of buying Nokia 8800 Sirocco has been. Along with the handset the package includes a great amount of high-class accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp; An exclusive phone needs an exclusive packaging </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Size modifications in Nokia 8800 Sirocco as to the classical 8800 model are insignificant. Sirocco is just by a millimeter thicker. The resulting measures are: 107 x 45 x 17.5 mm. Due to the mass of the used materials, however, the phone weighs 138 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;The phone in palm</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Size comparison with a credit card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When closed, the phone has a rather minimalist design, much like its forerunner. The keypad is invisible; surfaces are even and glossy. Holding the steel-covered Nokia 8800 Sirocco in palm is a pleasant experience, but constant cleaning is simply inevitable. If you ignore this duty, you would get ashamed rather than be admired as fingerprints appear immediately and could hardly remain unnoticed. That is why, the manufacturer has enclosed a dark-brown clothe, which you should always keep with you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Glossy steel-made panels remind mirrors </paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Fingerprints stick firmly to the panels ? cleaning clothe</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The click<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Sirocco looks very compact and solid. Closing mechanism works superbly. Much like its forerunner, Nokia 8800 Sirocco features a specific sliding construction and any new user will need some time to get used to managing its mechanism. Most of my colleagues would try to take to the hollow in the panel covering the keypad and push downwards. Instead, you have to simply place your thumb a bit higher, on the shaped silver jag and press upwards. The display slides up and out together with the entire keypad. End-locks are accompanied by a pleasant metal-like click reminding the sound given out by the Zippo lighters. The movements in both ways are smoothened and eased by strong springs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jag for the thumb </paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Sliding mechanism works seamlessly </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has no side keys. Here you will only find parts of the rear panel locks. When being removed, the rear panel moves on pretty long and tiny rails, contributing to the overall solidness of the phone body. The panel is made of steel too, of course. Beneath it you will find a small Lithium-Ion battery of the BP-6X type specially made for this phone. According to the official statements it provides power for up to 240 hours of stand-by or up to 165 minutes of call time. After having removed the back panel, I started to look for a memory card slot, but I could not find any even though Nokia had originally promised to implement one ? a drawback that we once criticized in Nokia 8800 and that - to our great disappointment ? appears in the new model too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;All-side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Removing the back panel ? the panel is made of steel</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Battery and SIM bed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On its back Nokia 8800 Sirocco has another hollow, shallower than the one on the front. The phone is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera, whose lens is located untraditionally behind the display and remains hidden and protected when the handset is closed. The lens pops out when the upper part of the body slides up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Back panel lock ? handle plate on the back </paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;The camera lens is hidden </paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the very top of the body you will see the main on/off button, which also allows for instant selection and activation of profiles when the phone is on. The bottom of the device is occupied by the charger and the earphone slot. Nokia has abandoned the idea about a standard Pop-Port, supposedly due to the curves of this part of the phone. Hence, take into account that any synchronization or file transfers will only be possible via wireless connection, that is, slowly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Main on/off button and the loud speaker ? there is no standard Pop-Port </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of accessories<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Sirocco is charged by being inserted into a heavy metal holder, whose base circuit is attractively illuminated in blue. Together with the handset the holder can simultaneously charge a second battery so that one can take it as a back-up right away. The second battery comes enclosed in the phone?s retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cradle charger with blue-illuminated base </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Both the phone and a second battery can be inserted in the charger simultaneously </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another attractive accessory is the earphone ? a HS-15 headset with wires covered with textile material, a 2.5mm jack, and a clip with a microphone. The clip is metal and rotatable; in its top part there is a tiny hollow for the microphone accompanied by a call and voice-control button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   HS-15 headset </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we were testing the original Nokia 8800, we were criticizing its wire-handsfree, which we considered unsuitable for such an expensive phone. Such a device definitely deserved a wireless earphone. Fortunately, Nokia knows to learn from its mistakes: in Nokia 8800 Sirocco?s package you will find a second, Bluetooth HS-64W handsfree of elegant, light and compact design, with a removable clip. Its sound abilities are satisfactory. The button for accepting calls is spacey and comfortable, apart of playing the role of a decorative element. Another cool element is the tiny dual key controlling volume levels. The thin wire holds the device firmly behind one?s ear; it is extremely comfortable to wear, even if it does not seem so at first sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Elegant Bluetooth handsfree HS-64W </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another important accessory enclosed with the handset is the phone case. Would have anyone ever thought this could be made of something else but leather? The manufacturer?s logo is incrusted and polished in its top part. The phone is extracted in a rather interesting way, that is, sideways; both the top and the bottom of the case are closed. The ?cutout? starts on the right side of the case and comes up to the middle of its top: a great solution as the phone holds firmly inside and at the same time is easy to insert and pull out. Our only fear is that the edges of the open area of the case may become loose and start to gap away with the time ? a tendency, which we could notice after only a few days of testing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; The leather-made case features interesting design </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Same display, different keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 Sirocco display is identical to the one in Nokia 6230i, both in terms of resolution and size: 30 x 30 mm, 208 x 208 pixels. Supported colors have increased to 262K, but the difference is hard to tell with a bare eye. The displays of the original Nokia 8800 and Nokia 8800 Sirocco are absolutely the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Display is protected by a sapphire glass </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture is very fine and sharp, with enough contrast. The pity, however, is that the font color can only be modified within the standby mode, but does not refer to the entire menu. In result, dark wallpapers remain virtually useless for work with the menu as these make some legends illegible. The display is protected by a hardened sapphire glass resistant to scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The display in the dark </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is plastic. Backlighting is blue-white and strong enough. The keys panel is positioned comfortably so that one does not need to bend their thumb in an unnatural way. Typing is ergonomic, eased by the fact that Nokia 8800 Sirocco?s keypad occupies more or less the same area where most phones have their display. Keys react smoothly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  The keypad slides up together with the display </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Certain changes have been made in the distribution and the form of the keypad when compared to the original 8800. The number keys are now positioned with an inclination. In result, they are easy to press no matter how little space they occupy. The call receiving keys are very large. The confirming center of the main control key has been enlarged as well and is now easier to be found without looking at it. At the same time, the band around it representing the four navigation ways will be the source of problems for most users: ladies will almost surely come to break long nails, while rich gentlemen with thicker fingers will lose a lot of nerves. And one more remark: the edge of the metal panel of the keypad disturbs the work with the bottom key line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Main four-way key with a confirming center </paragraph>
			<paragraph>It took us a long time before we got used to the location of the context keys next to the thumb rest for slide-out. In other words, they are not part of the keypad, as in most phones is. At the beginning of our tests we would often mistake them with the call-control keys. The reason for the unusual place of the context keys is the design harmony, which is - after all - what most counts in Nokia 8800 Sirocco.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Few options with a closed handset<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When closed, the phone offers very few options: accept calls, receive SMS, or silence ringtones. Nothing else. Aside from the context keys, the only usable element left is the main on/off button: single presses help you browse profiles, while a longer press confirms your selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Context keys are accessible when the phone is closed, but unfortunately their usage is rather limited </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another significant drawback (mentioned already in the first chapter) is the absence of a standard Pop-Port connector. In the bottom of the handset you will only find a classical charger slot and a slot for a minijack, which results in a mono speaker output. If you want to listen to the radio, be sure to first plug in the earphone, as it plays the role of an antenna. Once the latter has been inserted, you may also direct the sound to come out through the loud speaker. In all events, both the radio and the MP3 player are said to be able to play stereo via Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The functions of the context keys are user-configurable. The left context key serves the function ?Go to?, while the right one is used to select option. Each of the four ways of the main control key can be assigned any menu function as well. The main menu could be visualized either like a sequence of standard large icons, or like a 3 x 3 matrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Main display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most expensive Nokia model uses 3rd edition of Series 40 user interface. Since the active stand-by display of S40 has recently been implemented and it cannot fit into Nokia 8800 Sirocco?s small display, the phone lacks certain functions. On the other hand, however, it offers 13 special themes and ringtones, which cannot be found in any other Nokia model. A very interesting feature of the interface is the white coloring on the display: the white color changes its nuances in accordance with the corresponding active theme. For example, if you setup a brown theme, the white automatically becomes slightly brownish; if the active theme is red, the white gets a pink nuance.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A thousand of multi-field contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Up to 1000 names fit into the phone memory. Contacts stored on the SIM card and in the phone can be used simultaneously. Each contact can be assigned 5 types of phone numbers, of which the first one is set as a default number. Additional customization is possible though. Here are some other available fields: an email and a web address, a street address, a picture and a note; a nickname, a company position, a ringtone, and a videotone. The phonebook offers a total of 19 fields for each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  View options for the phonebook ? creating a new contact ? fields to assign to a contact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  A view at a selected contact ? group editing ? searching by gradual typing </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can be displayed in the form of a standard name list, like a name list with numbers, or like a name list, where each name is assigned a picture (up to 100 positions available). Each name can be added in more than one group, while each group can be assigned both a ringtone and a picture. The pictures assigned to names are preferred to those assigned to groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Font size options </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message creation follows common standards. Nokia 8800 Sirocco works with SMS, MMS, emails, and Instant Messaging. All messages are stored in the shared internal memory of 128 MB. SMS can be fragmented into 6 sub-messages. Counting starts from the first character. The phone features a T9 dictionary. MMS size should not exceed 300 KB. Nokia 8800 Sirocco also has an inbuilt email client, which manages POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Memory indicator </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Message editor ? typing a SMS ? working options within a message </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each message type can be assigned a specific alert ? a function impossible to find in any other Nokia model. Of course, this kind of setup comes as a part of the pre-installed profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Modifying ringtones </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Was it necessary?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s now pay a closer attention to Nokia 8800 Sirocco?s camera, which ? according to my and some of my colleagues? opinion - could have not been installed in the phone at all. But it is, perhaps to allow future owners to merrily capture special moments and exchange them with friends via MMS. If this was the idea, then let it be. But if you mean to print the images taken with Sirocco?s 2 megapixel camera, before you start shooting first make sure that light conditions are perfect and that the selected scene is as little detailed as possible. In other words, Nokia 8800 Sirocco?s camera scores worse than almost any other 2 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Camera lens </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features white balance, but no exposure compensation. The digital zooming is absolutely fluent, but creates crops only, alias, it is useless. Available are also various color effects, a self-release, and a night mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Sample photos in full resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoom creates crops only</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Images of closely-located objects are poor (there is no macro mode) ? text photos are horrible </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sirocco makes videos in 3GP format in resolution of 176 x 144 pixels. The records are surprisingly fluent, but low resolution limits their use. As it seems, video duration is only limited by the available internal phone memory. At the beginning of our test, for example, the phone offered us an entire hour of video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Limited MP3 usage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The menu includes a general media player as well an application called Music player. The Music player manages MP3 and AAC formats. An option for creating one?s own playlists as well as a simple equalizer with Rock, Pop and two user-configurable presets are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music player </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player features Repeat and Shuffle as well as Select All options (marks all music files in the phone). In the last case the phone searches in the folder ?Music files?, so you would better store all your MP3 files here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Player settings ? playing options </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound is classy. Yet, it does not achieve the performance of standard MP3 players or music phones like Sony Ericsson?s Walkman lineup, for example. The possibility to simultaneously listen to music and browse the phone menu is present. Music files are played in the order stated in the currently active playlist. On stand-by the phone displays file names and the date in regular intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting the equalizer </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned earlier, it is a great pity that Nokia 8800 Sirocco only has a minijack as this excludes the plug-in of standard earphones. Enclosed handsfree sets are good for calls, but not for high-class music performance. Nokia managers probably expect future solvent Sirocco owners to be selective enough to not do with a phone MP3 player, but prefer to get themselves a classical MP3 player instead. On the other hand, Sony Ericsson Walkman models are a perfect example that the player-in-a-phone solution is simply great. Considering the lack of a memory card slot in Nokia 8800 Sirocco, however, any full-function music player built in it would have been in vain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also has a radio identical to the radios used in all other model from the Series 40. There are 20 positions for stations; automatic search is reliable. Unfortunatelly, there is no RDS support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The calendar ? the mother of wisdom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar can store 5 event types: meeting, call, birthday, note, and reminder. Notes can be up to 160-character long. You can set the calendar to automatically delete events in predetermined time intervals. Each event can also be repeated. Event records can be visualized in a month, week, or day view. The first weekday is user-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Month ? week view at the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Selecting a new event ? entering details </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer offers a task manager too. Tasks can be marked as given low, normal, or high priority. Marking-off after accomplishing is available as well. Notes can contain up to 3000 characters, but it is hard to believe anyone will ever make use of so much space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Task manager</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock will wake you up even if the phone is off. Alerts are repeated; snooze intervals are user-configurable. Alarm can be represented by a standard ringing, radio broadcast, or a MP3 file. In the menu you will also find a common stopwatch, a countdown, and a calculator, a unit converter and world time clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Calculator ? stopwatch</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Unit converter ? world time</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end, let?s also mention the voice recorder used for recording of ongoing calls. Its time limit is 60 minutes ? absolutely sufficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice recorder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WAP browser opens simple web pages too. The phone can serve as a modem for internet connection (only via Bluetooth though). Data flows are not the best the Finns could have offered: Nokia 8800 Sirocco support EDGE and GPRS technologies, but both are Class 8. Why Nokia did not equip this new bijou with Class 10 remains a mystery. Synchronization with PC is backed up by PC Suite.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mission accomplished<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia has once again managed to design a mobile phone that meets the wishes of precisely those clients it has been made for. Any data features, organizing functions or calling options should be taken as nothing more but a good base for work and calls. The crucial priority of this model is to thrill you and grab others attention at first sight, including due to its price tag. The materials are outstanding, the construction is brilliant; applications and all features are the result of a careful selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I suppose that as the time passes by, Nokia 8800 Sirocco?s owners will start to feel the impact of drawback, like the lack of memory cards, the constant necessity of cleaning the panels and the display glass, or the lack of a system connector.</paragraph>
