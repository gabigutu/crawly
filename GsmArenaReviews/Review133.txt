			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Aino is without a doubt one entertaining slider. It does pretty much all the stuff the other Sony Ericsson feature phones do, but does it better. It brings in some heavy multimedia firepower such as a PS3-inspired touch menu, a large 3-inch touchscreen, VGA@30fps video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, Wi-Fi and GPS are also in the mix to make the device that much more tempting. The Remote Play feature, initially developed for PSP, enables users to control and access media content on Playstation 3 from their phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we don't really find the Sony Ericsson Aino exterior breathtaking. It rather takes a somewhat conservative approach and an unassuming touch-only look, when it's not opened.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Aino at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino is the first phone by Sony Ericsson to sport a widescreen and touchscreen display. Yes, the 3-inch screen is actually touch-enabled but only in the multimedia part of the menu and the camera interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel camera is all there as well, so you can bet you get all the goodies that Sony Ericsson can offer in one single device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, the Sony Ericsson Aino is in our lab right now and it's ready for some pre-release action. There are limitations of course - for instance, the camera is nowhere near proper working condition, but there's plenty of time ahead of market release. We really hope to get a better working unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not keep you waiting any longer. Head on to the next page for our hands-on scoop of the Sony Ericsson Aino hardware and ergonomics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Aino 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Aino display is 3 inches wide and sports the somewhat peculiar WQVGA resolution (432 x 240 pixels). We cannot remember a pixel count as peculiar since we reviewed the Samsung F490 a long, long time ago.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite its compactness, the closed Sony Ericsson Aino instantly creates the impression of a full touch device. The lack of any keys whatsoever on the front panel and the relative slimness have led to a simplified front panel that comes so natural to touchscreen devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The truth however is Sony Ericsson Aino does have touchscreen capabilities but those are only limited to a few multimedia parts of the menu. Not that we haven't seen a similar approach before - the LG KF750 Secret had the same semi-touch multimedia thing going on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aino front panel is mainly occupied by the large 3-inch display and a bunch of sensors located in the vicinity (some of them are hidden in the earpiece).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as picture quality is concerned the Sony Ericsson Aino performs decently although its prematurity shines through. We are hoping to get better treatment once units closer to release become available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen capabilities are limited to a new and specially designed multimedia menu, which has nicely thumb-optimized icons. We are glad that Sony Ericsson went for the capacitive technology this time as we tend to prefer it over its resistive alternative. However we cannot pass a judgment on the touchscreen responsiveness as our Sony Ericsson Aino unit was way too unstable to be a proper reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the slider reveals a whole bunch of keys and turns the Aino into an incredibly long handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated Call and End knobs are crammed between the soft keys and the Activity menu and C key, but they are still large enough and easy to hit. The problem with our unit was that they were on the stiff side, which made actually getting your press registered a somewhat harder task. We are certainly hoping that this will be sorted out in the final version of the Aino.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad of the Sony Ericsson Aino is using a waved layout but is too rather rigid, much like the keys above it. That's why we will refrain ourselves from passing a judgment on it usability at this stage and wait for a more final unit to arrive.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino has its Fast Port on the left side much like the other handset we are previewing today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker (which also doubles as a zoom lever) and the camera button are on the opposite side. Those are both comfortable to use and do not spoil the user experience at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microphone pinhole and (somewhat peculiarly) the loudspeaker grill are at the bottom of Sony Ericsson Aino. It's pretty strange that Sony Ericsson claim that the Aino is equipped with stereo speakers as we cannot figure out where that other speaker might be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only control on top of the handset is the lock key. With the touchscreen operation so severely limited and all keys comfortably sliding behind the display the users are unlikely to need such a control at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backside is neat and simple with the 8 megapixel camera and the LED flash at its top left corner the only thing of interest. The camera lens isn't protected with a lens cover, most probably in order to reduce the handset's thickness but that makes getting it scratched a pretty probable scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino draws its power from a 1000 mAh Li-Po battery. It does sound a bit too small to us but Sony Ericsson have a pretty good record as far a battery life is concerned so they might make the best out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the battery, under the back cover is the microSD (yay!) card slot, which is hot-swappable even though you will have to remove the back panel every time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>To touch or not to touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At first glance the Sony Ericsson Aino interface is just like all the other Sony Ericsson phones you might have seen in the past two year or so. But much like with Sony Ericsson Yari, the interface has had its share of updates. Most of them are the same as the ones we described in the Yari preview, while others are specific to Aino and its semi-touchscreen input method.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the user interface is Flash-based with all the visual eye-candy implied. Let's just say that it would be hard to find a better looking or more customizable feature phone interface than the one on Sony Ericsson phones - especially now that it has just been updated again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the familiar part of the Aino interface that you may see on the screenshots in almost all of our recent Sony Ericsson reviews, there is something else - and quite unexpected too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the new Media menu, which is? controlled by touch. What's even more - the only way to interact with it is by touch, so if you slide the keyboard open for example, thinking of little D-pad action there, you would be out of luck. In such cases the new Media menu just closes immediately by itself. Now we are not quite sure if this should be the planned behavior of the menu, but that's the way it is at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking closer at the new touch interface, you may find quite a lot of similarities with the Sony PlayStation 3 or the Sony PSP interface. And that's not a coincidence. The Sony Ericsson Aino is expected to have compatibility with the PS3 console. It will use the new function Remote Play, which was initially created for PSP. It allows you to control your PlayStation 3 or browse its multimedia content via your Aino.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty in wireless connectivity is the new way to interact with your desktop-installed Media Go software. With Sony Ericsson Aino you will also be able to download multimedia content from your desktop library over the air thanks to the Media Home service which uses a Wi-Fi connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this stage the new touch interface is attractive but still clumsy, and we expect that to be fixed further on in the development process. After all, we have a pre-production unit on our hands here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch interface is home to the camera, the FM radio, the gallery, the Walkman and the video player. Both players have some submenus for the playlists, recently added, resume button, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the idea of the touch-enabled multimedia menu, but touch-enabling the whole user interface seems a much nicer option to us. But again, that would bring up numerous other challenges that will need solving.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The new media center<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like the Sony Ericsson Yari, the Aino comes with the latest Walkman player 3.0. It definitely looks the part - especially on a screen that big. you will find the new graphical styles here as well - tape recorders, gramophones, CD players - it's all part of the game of making the Walkman player more attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch gallery is nothing revolutionary. There's no kinetic scrolling or anything, upon a finger sweep the image just changes. You can tap on screen to see the options ? edit, zoom, delete. But let?s not forget our Aino is just a prototype and the gallery will likely have its capabilities extended and optimized in the retail version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch audio and video players look almost the same. There are three standard control buttons ? previous, next and play/pause. The video player has also send and delete as additional options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is supported. There is no portrait mode, only landscape. When the screen is locked, but the music is still going on, tapping it brings the touch music controls up on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio has new touch optimized user interface and looks very good. Frankly, it may well be the best UI among mobile FM receivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old media center is also available, but unfortunately it won't be touch controlled.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The only way to control the camera menu is by touch again and unfortunately in our prototype it didn't quite work. But according to the press information, the Aino should be able to take 8 megapixel photos and - finally - capture VGA video at 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is similar to some other touch camera UIs by Sony Ericsson - the ones on Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 or Sony Ericsson G900, for instance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full pack connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, the Aino sports Wi-Fi connectivity plus DLNA. Connecting to our access point was hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there is also the integrated GPS receiver with Assisted start. The navigation software, which comes with the Aino, is the usual Wayfinder Navigator (but Google Maps 3.0 is on board as well).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing is a treat with the latest NetFront 3.5 browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser preinstalled on the Aino is the same as Yari's - an updated version of the popular NetFront 3.5 mobile browser. It offers a much smoother experience than before and renders web pages more quickly. Almost every time it nails the zoom level for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equipped with the well-known mouse pointer, the new NetFront 3.5 web browser always operates in fullscreen mode and the four most important features are easily accessible on a toolbar - mini-map, enter an address, favorites and downloads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, we spotted some other new features as well such as mark-and-copy, allowing you to copy text off web pages and the added Flash support (which unfortunately doesn't really relate to Flash video watching).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, the Sony Ericsson Aino surely did surprise us. The very concept of it is so unlike Sony Ericsson. You've got a huge touchscreen, 8 megapixel camera, Wi-Fi, GPS, plus all the other well-known goodies. We've gotta say that the microSD card support is more than welcome too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No longer do you have to choose between a Cyber-shot and a Walkman, and no longer should you check out the competition when decent video recording is a must. It seems that Sony Ericsson are changing their game plan and thus maybe even changing the game itself.</paragraph>
