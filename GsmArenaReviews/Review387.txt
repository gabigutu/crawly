			<paragraph>HTC is launching a new communicator based on the Windows Mobile 5 platform, which the German operator T-Mobile decided to adopt as a successor of the popular Compact line (HTC Magician). The new HTC P3300 features revolutionary user-control, an integrated GPS receiver and FM radio. Naturally, the device has a few cons as well. After all, would this review be valuable if we did not try to discover them?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>MDA Compact (HTC Magician) became a part of T-Mobile?s portfolio at the beginning of 2005. It entered the market as a revolutionary device among communicators based on the Windows Mobile platform. Its crucial advantage was its small size against the forerunners like MDA II (HTC Himalaya) or MDA III (HTC Blue Angel), which could only be carried hooked on a belt or in a case. All communicators before MDA Compact were considered "big" as well as ?non-practical? due to the lack of important software functions. Along with its modest size MDA Compact offered an improved interface for contact dialing and a user-friendly, no-stylus mode of typing SMS. It lacked Wi-Fi and EDGE, but 2 years ago it was not a big deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Logically, the successors did not hesitate to appear. The first one was MDA Compact II (HTC Charmer); apart from being based on the new OS Windows Mobile 5 it also supported EDGE. On the other hand its processor Texas Instruments OMAP850 (200 MHz) was far slower than Intel XScale (416 MHz) used in the original Compact. Yet, the basic reason for many users not to go for MDA Compact II, but wait for a better model, was probably the lack of Wi-Fi support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi appeared soon afterwards in the communicator we know as Qtek S200 (HTC Prophet) ? a device full of features, with improved control, Wi-Fi support, and a brilliant display. The pity was that the manufacturer had once again ?backed the wrong horse? and had set to the non-popular processor Texas Instruments OMAP850 running at just 200Mhz. In the end, T-Mobile decided not to include it in its portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That is why consumers chose to give precedence to MDA Vario (HTC Wizard). Besides, compared to Qtek S200, MDA Vario had the advantage of possessing a superb hardware keypad. Even though MDA Vario was not a direct Compact successor, it was definitely worth special attention. Its only deficiency was and still is its slow processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here we have ? the new HTC P3300 (HTC Artemis), also presented by T-Mobile as MDA Compact III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  T-Mobile MDA Compact III was presented at the IFA fair </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see in the picture with technical specifications, it is quite probable that T-Mobile will have HTC create a special version of the communicator without Wi-Fi support. I personally consider a communicator without Wi-Fi a ready failure, unless its price is considerably lower than the basic version of the device. But let?s now pay attention to the original model HTC P3300.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reference table of all HTC manufactured PocketPC and Smartphone devices</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dandy in a small frock<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At first sight HTC P3300 looks longer than Compact. The real dimensions of both devices are nearly identical though. The great advantage of HTC P3300 consists in its slim profile and less than 130 grams of weight. Even if a communicator, HTC is so small and elegant that it reminds some of Nokia smartphones. It feels comfortable in any pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body of the communicator is made of dark grey plastics. There are no decorative metal elements except for two glossy bands on both sides. P3300 is no fashion freak. It looks rather moderate and practical. It is also very comfortable to hold due to the roundness off all its edges. The body is elaborated precisely and looks solid? all parts stick firmly one to another.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The brightest of all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC P3300?s display has standard parameters: QVGA resolution or 240 x 320 pixels, 65K colors. On one hand, it is true that other communicators in the same price and size categories do not offer more; on the other hand, however, an increased resolution is becoming highly desirable since common mobile phones for 100-200 euros feature the same resolution. The display diagonal measures the standard 2.8 inches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there are other aspects, in which HTC P3300 scores better: it is highly probable that HTC has used a display of qualities similar to those of Qtek S200?s display. Contrast and color saturation are good, while maximum brightness is excellent. The legibility of the display under direct sunlight is perfect. Improvement is especially notable when HTC P3300 is directly compared to its current competitors or with the older Compact communicators. Backlighting only has 4 stages ? a minus I am willing to pass over because of the quality of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC P330 has a touchscreen display, which ? quite naturally - is vulnerable to scratches. If you care about your communicator, I recommend you to use a protecting foil. The latter may slightly reduce brightness, but will matt the display eliminating the reflections of the surrounding objects. The communicator offers a stylus for work with the display. It consists of a middle metal part and plastic endings. The stylus is long enough but may create difficulties to users with bigger fingers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Trackball in a pocket computer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Control is quite unusual. The standard four-way control key has been substituted by a steering ring. Even more interesting, however, is the white ball located inside the wheel. Its function will be no mystery for those of you experienced with Trackball (frequently used in older notebooks). By scrolling the ball in all directions you drive the cursor on the display and can basically control almost all available functions without having to pull out the pencil or to use both your hands. When active, the ball is illuminated in dark blue. The cursor control mode applied in HTC P3300 is similar to the one used in HP iPaq hx4700 (a device with touchpad beneath its display).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Theory is important. Yet, practice is even more important. I am not sure what type of mechanism scans ball?s movements, but I suppose it has a lot in common with the roller system applied in a traditional mouse. Horizontal and vertical shifts are smooth. Diagonals are managed in a sort of jumps, a bit clumsy. In sum, the cursor sometimes moves in unpredictable ways, so be patient when you target smaller fields like the soft keypad or when you switch between days in the calendar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Steer it around!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The glossy silver ring around the ball scrolls in both directions substituting the vertical ways of a standard navigation key. It is a truly practical and very fast driver, whom the manufacturer named Trackwheel. Yet it has one shortcoming, which we would better describe in a practical example: first we make a move downwards in the application menu using the ball and at the same time we select one application. A press on the ball, however, does not run the selected application but "confirms" the place, where the arrow is aiming. After having scrolled the respective page with the ball you have to grasp the ball once again, select the respective application with the arrow and run it. The entire process creates a significant time lag. Let?s hope that it is a pure software problem, which designers will manage to eliminate before the communicator hits the mass market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is quite a pity that HTC does not offer the ability to press the steering ring in all four directions. The lack of real arrows may be a difficulty for some users. The navigation applications, for example, are hard to control, certain games are nearly impossible to play. Our words may sound much too critical, but in general the trackball is an exciting element to deal with. What?s more, we are convinced that this is the only way technology could progress until Microsoft manages to adapt its operational system to control through hardware buttons. The stylus is only indispensable when text is entered. In any case, it is highly recommendable that all above mentioned details are improved in the upcoming new models.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of keys<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ring is accompanied by 8 keys: two with receivers, two context ones, whose functions appear in the bottom bar of the display, two preset keys that run the communication manager, and the Internet browser. Just next to them are the Start and the OK/Close keys, which notably facilitate overall control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display there is a speaker bordered by LEDs. The right one indicates availability of GSM signal and charging; the left reacts to data-transfer technologies. On the top edge you will only find one speaker. The left side features a key for running voice-control applications. If you are used to working with a voice recorder, just pre-set the key. A bit lower there is a dual volume-control key; in the bottom ? a slot for instant soft-reset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the synchronizing connector is located at the bottom. It is a universal, practical miniUSB connector, but has one specialty: only one of its edges is beveled so that the earphones enclosed in the standard retailer package could not be used with another device. The communicator has no other physical output, like a standard 3.5mm jack, for example. In other words, the manufacturer makes users fully dependent on the original headset. So far we have no information about adapters. The only alternative to the original earphones is the high-quality wireless headset working with Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the communicator are the camera button (in the bottom) and the on/off button (at the top edge). Their location is exactly the same like in older Compact models. The difference is that the stylus in HTC P3300 is situated in its lower corner instead of its upper one. The pencil holds firmly to its bed; a bit of nail helps pick it out for sure. We recommend you to try out the trackball though. Its functions are worth the efforts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lens of the digital camera is located in the center of the rear panel of the communicator. It is flush with the surrounding surface, but not protected ? a perfect condition for making scratches. Beneath the camera lens there is a tiny mirror for self-portraits. There is no LED flash. Unlike Qtek S200 there is no manual macro mode, either. Pay attention to the rubber band at the top of the panel ? if you open it (from right to left, using the stylus, for example), you will reach the connector for the external antenna of the GPS receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery panel occupies a great part of the rear side of the communicator. It covers a Li-Ion battery with a capacity of 1200 mAh. The SIM card bed is positioned underneath it. Finding the slot of the memory card (a tiny microSD one (TransFlash) was a harder job to do; it took me several long minutes. Would it have ever occurred to you that it could be positioned under the SIM card bed? In other words, any change of the memory card not only requires that the battery is eased off, but also that the SIM card is removed. Card swappers with bigger fingers may as well forget about it! On the other hand, the better hidden the card is, the less dirt it attracts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>OS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC P3300 is equipped with the Windows Mobile 5 OS in its PocketPC Phone Edition. The manufacturer has not forgotten to integrate the latest updating package AKU2, which is comparable to Service Packs of Windows XP. Windows Mobile 5 brings along numerous interesting improvements, some of which will be mentioned a bit later. Let?s now start with a brief description of the operational system for absolute beginners. Those experienced could skip the following several paragraphs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Mobile 5 OS has inherited the address and file structures of its bigger ?brother?. It offers a registry and multitasking. Against common Windows, however, here there is no bar with running applications that one could add with the help of third parties? applications. Of course, should you need to or want to, you can enrich the OS with plenty additional applications. Along the progress history of Windows Mobile (earlier called Pocket PC) there could rarely be found crucial changes breaking the compatibility with older applications. That is why nowadays Internet offers several thousands of applications for this OS. They are so numerous that whenever you need a particular service, be sure you will run across an application that will not only be suitable, but will also be free of charge. Of course, Windows Mobile suffers from drawbacks too. For example, it tends to overload the system as every second installed application drags in its own library, registers and other lumber, which do not get eliminated once their application has been uninstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned several times the changes between Windows Mobile 2003SE and Window Mobile 5, let?s now sum them up briefly: the memory organization has undergone the most crucial modifications; in the older version RAM was used for both running programs and for storing of user data. ROM served the OS. The result was an automatic hard reset after battery discharge. In the new version this drawback has been eliminated in a simple and logical way: ROM is shared by the OS and the user data, while RAM only serves running applications. The principal is identical to the one applied in common computers. The only disadvantage of this change is that ROM is notably slower than RAM. In a result, it takes longer for applications to start running or for files to get copied. If you are used to installing your applications on the memory card, however, you may not even notice the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s now have a closer look at the novelties of the upgrading package AKU2. The first one is that Bluetooth works with the profile A2DP, which transfers stereo music files into wireless earphones. The second one ? but not the last ? is called Direct Push. This is a new system of mail delivering from the communicator to other mobile devices. The email box can be checked either manually, or automatically, in preset time intervals. Direct Push delivers messages immediately, but its smooth run requires that several conditions are met: your company server should be running on Microsoft Exchange 2003 Service Pack 2 and Mobile ActiveSync should be available. When using Direct Push you should expect higher data costs and decreased battery life.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slow-paced processor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC has again used the processor Texas Instruments OMAP 850 of the scant 200 MHz. It is clear that the processor clock speed is not always an indication of performance, but in the case of HTC P3300 it is so. Why HTC repeatedly uses such a weak processor since in other devices it applies far more powerful processors like Intel or Samsung remains a mystery and at the same time provokes many speculations. We believe price is the crucial factor. Unlike above mentioned competitors the processor Texas Instruments has all critical elements (voice/data communication module, input/output driving units, wireless technologies etc.) integrated on one chip, which naturally reduces the final price significantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter what Vario owners say, the TI OMAP 850 processor is slow. Do not blame us of being pedant in power units published in synthetic tests though. When compared directly with Eten M600+ (Intel XScale 416 MHz) HTC did lag in all tested operations. Actually, there is no need to compare the two devices. Simply try to run the calendar or the client for text messaging or open the settings and you will see what we are talking about. HTC could drive you mad. On the other hand, the processor deserves a compliment for its seamless work with the famous VoIP in Skype. There were no functional difficulties as to communication via Wi-Fi, no matter the fact that Skype developers recommend the use of a processor of at least 400 MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAM is 64 MB according to the specification. Its real capacity, however, is 48 MB. Nonetheless, only 25 MB remain available once the OS has been loaded (without installing neither popular resident applications for better task-management nor extras for Today screen. I guess our fear of using up all available memory if we had ran a navigational application was well reasoned. This unease could have been overcome for good by doubling the RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ROM is no big success, either. The total capacity is 128 MB, but users are only left 51 MB, the rest is used by the OS. Fortunately, HTC P3300 is equipped with a memory card slot. Bad news for the owners of older communicators though: the purchase of a new memory card is inevitable. The good old SD/MMC (MDA Compact I &amp; II, Qtek S200), even miniSD (MDA Vario) have been substituted by microSD (TransFlash). The problem is not the price of the memory card; it consists in the fact that the biggest offered capacity does not currently exceed 1 GB, which may not be enough for users in favor of navigation and multimedia.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC P3300 has a quad-band GSM module, that is, working in the following frequencies: 850, 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz. 3G UMTS networks support is missing. The phonebook offers an infinite capacity due to shared memory. Each contact can be assigned tons of fields. Common calls are made in the following way: switch on the communicator, press the green key to open the interface with virtual keypad, and from here search the desired contact using the special T9 search. Then select the contact and press the green key once again to start calling. The T9 search means that there is no need to press keys with letters repeatedly. A single press is enough for the communicator to start filtering the entries. Whether you search by first or last name is absolutely irrelevant. Of course, dialing just a number is possible too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphones enclosed in the retail package perform well! Their high volume capacity is perfect for the noisy city environment, but the highest two levels are accompanied by unpleasant noise. The application Voice Speed Dial for instant dialing and pocket computer control is available as well. HTC also mastered our audio test with a wireless Bluetooth earphone. What we notably missed were ringing profiles and call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us now go back to the VoIP communication via Skype mentioned in the previous chapter. As we said, HTC P3300 is powerful enough to support this application. At the same time, however, HTC sends the sound coming from the opposite part to the loud speaker on its rear side (just like most communicators do). Fortunately, the speaker is located in the upper part of the rear panel allowing for a relatively good-quality conversation. The only exception to the rule is the communicator E-Ten M600+, which features a smart utility that redirects sound to the speaker on the front.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SMS: the most important is missing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messaging is again backed by the application Inbox, which covers SMS, MMS and emails. Few elements have been modified in comparison to the forerunners: the application for creation of MMS allows you to insert text, pictures, videos and music files (items are only limited by the maximum data size predetermined by the corresponding operator). The email client supports POP3 and IMAP protocols including security certificates. You can download either email headers or their entire bodies. Auto-check in preset time intervals as well as signatures and attachments are available too. As we already mentioned, HTC P3300 also supports Direct Push.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text messages work in the same old way. What did surprised us was the absence of a virtual phone keypad, which allows for typing text (with multi-tap or T9) by touching virtual keys viewed on the display. Such virtual keypad does not offer the feedback real keys do, but getting accustomed is only a mater of time. I myself type on HTC Magician as fast as I do on a common mobile phone. Without a virtual keypad what you have left is three modes for manual text typing and a tiny virtual QWERTY keypad. The drawback they all suffer from is the inability to type with one hand. Let?s not forget, however, that the testing piece we are holding is a preliminary one. We all believe that the final model will feature a virtual keypad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data communication<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that HTC P3300 will satisfy all fans of mobile Internet and its additional services. Mobile data transfers are backed by GPRS Class 10. You may even enjoy three times faster surfing provided you are in an EDGE-covered area. The difference between both technologies is hard to overlook as fully graphic Internet opened via GPRS requires a great dose of patience. The presence of EDGE signal is indicated by an E in the top state bar. In areas of no EDGE the letter E is substituted by G. If you need UMTS or HSDPA, for example, you would better go for another device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another available form of data communication is Wi-Fi, which we mentioned at the very beginning in a reference to T-Mobile. Some Internet sources speak about support of the 802.11 B/G standard, but in the tests with 802.11g access point we did not measure a speed higher than 11 Mbit/s. HTC P3300 does pretty much better than HTC Wizard in terms of working radius.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us also include Bluetooth (in 2.0 version) in this chapter. HTC P3300 has left interface selection to Microsoft. It offers basic details without extra information. Even so the respective manager has undergone several improvements: a novelty is the support for document synchronization through Bluetooth. Generally it only allows access to one address book, but in reality the entire ?My Documents? folder could be shared. The sharing process works seamlessly both in Windows XP and MacOS X. Work with Bluetooth is smooth too. The wireless earphone, the external GPS receiver, and general communication with mobile phones all function perfectly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other functions and multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As a device equipped with Windows Mobile OS HTC P3300 can easily be used as a video player. Considering its low processor, however, conversion to lower resolution and slower data flow is inevitable. While other devices of the same category driven by a 400 MHz processor manage to play videos designed for PC, HTC?s 200 MHz processor just cannot make it. Nevertheless, if you have a powerful computer, the required conversion in the application PocketDivXEncoder should not be a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another useful element in HTC P3300 is its built-in FM radio. As far as we know, this is the first ever communicator of its category to have a radio. The pity was that we did not have the chance to try it out as HTC P3300 was delivered to our office without a headset, which substitutes the antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual standard audio output has been abandoned. Earlier we were used to a small 2.5 mm jack, which allowed the use of an adapter. In this model, similar to HTC MTeoR, the earphones are plugged into a mini USB connector. While both edges of the synchronizing cable are beveled, the earphones have only one beveled edge and thus cannot be connected to other USB connectors but the HTC P3300?s one. Currently we cannot think of any adapter that would allow you to plug a good headset of your own in the communicator. The only available solution untill such an adapter appears on the market (if ever) remains Bluetooth with A2DP profile.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Focused on navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apparently, HTC has done its best to catch up with the latest technological trends, especially the one focused on navigation. This is the first ?Compact" equipped with a GPS receiver. The manufacturer has used the chip SiRF Star III (the best solution in terms of price), adding a useful application for faster satellite search. Once activated and before it determines user?s position, the receiver needs first to connect to the satellites and download detailed information about their location. The fewer the satellites the GPS receiver detects, the longer it takes it to start running. The above mentioned additional application helps to download all necessary information (a few KB) via Internet, advancing the start of the navigation. As the satellites move constantly, however, the validity of downloaded data expires within approximately three days and a new download is required. At the same time it is all the same whether the necessary information is gathered via mobile data transfers, via a Wi-Fi network, or through synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s now put an end to theoretical explanations and start practicing. Although we downloaded the most recent positional details by mobile data transfers, it took quite a long time to the communicator to locate the satellites (the sky was clear). For example, iPaq hw6515 featuring a similar additional application starts to navigate within a few seconds after having been activated. It feels as if in HTC P3300 the navigational chip and the corresponding application were not linked. Yet, let?s not forget that we are working with a sample unit, not with an officially sold model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once HTC has found the satellites, it starts to navigate seamlessly. During our weekend trip it helped us find three geocache treasures. Along with HTC P3300 we also carried a MDA Compact (HTC Magician) with an external GPS receiver and an older navigation chip SiRF Star II in order to be able to compare both devices simultaneously. The result was stunning: on a hill under a clear sky both communicators showed absolutely the same position including navigation preciseness. In a deep forest, however, as well as inside the city HTC P3300 scored far better. The older MDA Compact with external receiver simply failed to deliver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC is going to offer P3300 in two versions differing by the range of the application TomTom Navigator enclosed in their retail packages. We apologize for not being able to tell you exactly which cartographic data will be offered as standard. The final original package is just not available yet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera: where have the times of S200 gone?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera has a fully remade interface and works in a resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. P3300 takes pictures in landscape mode, just like cameraphones do. A key on the right side of the phone or the trackball can be used as a shutter release button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also has a 10x digital zoom, but this is only accessible in the lowest available resolution. In higher resolution the zoom is virtually useless. Standard functions like exposure compensation, white balance, multi-step quality control or self-timer are available too. In addition, you could even choose between evaluative and spot exposure metering; pictures can include the date and the time when they were taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, HTC P3300 scores worse than expected in one of the most important aspects for all mobile devices nowadays ? image quality. Sharpness is poor even at the highest-quality setting. Exposure metering does not work well, either (have a closer look at the fifth picture with vines). The observed results disappointed us, but most of all they surprised us, because Qtek S200, which we wrote about in the summer this year, made so good photos that they could even compete with top-rated mobiles like Sony Ericsson K750. Allow us not to make any conclusions from the above findings, though, as a few software tweaks can easily turn this situation upside down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard and additional software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The OS offers numerous useful applications. The communicator has a user-friendly calendar with several views and plenty of features for new events. Event can be alerted about in advance, but not on a particular day or at exact time. Windows Mobile 5 supports neither manually typed notes, nor voice notes. The same holds true for the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s also mention the remade version of the office applications Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, and Power Point Mobile. The first two of them open documents and provide trouble-free editing. For example, you can receive documents, modify them and send them back via Internet. Although Microsoft has recently been working hard to improve these applications, there are still components suffering from partial incompatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few more interesting applications: a standard image browser, a MIDlet Manager for Java applications and games, a calculator, a file browser etc. HTC also has a special offer, outside the standard menu: an excellent application for data back-up called Sprite Backup. It can make a backup of the entire device or of selected sections only. HTC has also added a ClearVue PDF browser, but its performance is far worse than the spectacle of the special version of the Adobe original application. A few less important novelties can be found in the settings menu too. The most visible one is the Task Manager. It does not display a full list of all running applications, but is only able to modify the meaning of the key with a cross so that the corresponding application could be fully closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And do not forget: should you need any application, just browse the Internet for a while ? you would find a suitable solution for sure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nobody is perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The communicator HTC P3300 surprised me very positively: its size is perfect; it has a great shining display, Wi-Fi and EDGE support, an integrated GPS receiver, and last, but not the least ? a great single-hand control mode. As it usually happens, however, no device could be absolutely perfect. HTC P3300 has a rather slow processor and lacks a universal audio output. On the other hand, neither of these two drawbacks is of great importance if you do not plan to play games or use the communicator as a music player.</paragraph>
