			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 is about to be three times lucky. But any way you look at it, it's nothing short of a dozen. Not that we wanted to make that much fuss, but a bunch of 12 megapixel pictures coming from a phone are always worth it. All the more so, when they come out just right. With two quick primers behind us already, we're about to focus on the Samsung M8910 behind the Pixon12.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 Pixon12 is a top of the line cameraphone but some may find it guilty of not being a smartphone. It's got the ultimate in still photography but not the best video a handset can offer. It's a dream-come-true upgrade but can the mishaps of the original Pixon spell trouble? Awaiting its official launch, the Pixon12 is standing tall against the odds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to capturing your moments and sharing them with the world though, the Pixon12 will hardly let you down. On top of the industry leading camera, the phone has all the connectivity options you may need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we're setting off on our last trip with the Samsung M8910 Pixon12. We know it's got enough fire to scorch most of them big-shot cameraphones. But is it enough fire to call the fire department?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original M8800 Pixon was dragged down by the lack of some key features and it seems Samsung chose to treat their top cameraphone with more respect this time. The Pixon12 boasts a complete pack of features, including Wi-Fi and SatNav software to go with the embedded GPS chip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The complete xenon plus LED flash package will go down well with the cameraphone buffs. As a whole, the Pixon12 strives to be the complete imaging device with a wide-angle variable aperture lens and a whole bunch of camera features that Samsung are usually keen to offer anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in pure upgrade terms, the Pixon12 is well worth it for the new TouchWiz interface, full of eye-candy and faster than ever. Smarter than smart may be too much, but the TouchWiz 2.0 is simply better a year later. A multimedia gadget like the Samsung S8000 Jet will sure take maximum advantage of the new 3D interface, but the M8910 Pixon12 cannot afford to fall behind either.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What's in the low-equipped box?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A high-end handset like the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 implies a retail box brimming with extra stuff. Well, not this time - and no surprise - if you followed the original Pixon. Just like its predecessor, the Pixon12 is bringing only the most essential things along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contents of the retail package include the mandatory charger, a data cable and a two-piece handsfree that allows changing the headphones without losing the remote functionality. The headset remote ends on a 3.5 mm jack so you have quite a choice of alternatives to use with the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Please don't gloom too much on that second battery up there on the shot. Our Pixon12 indeed arrived with 2 batteries, but it turned out it's just a strange mistake - the retail package of the Pixon12 will include only a single battery - the primary one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What would've been really welcome is a memory card, as the Pixon12's 150 MB of inbuilt storage are but dwarfed by market leading devices like the N97 and the iPhone, or Samsung's own Omnia HD. Of course, that can be changed at any time and also - retail contents are usually market dependent so do expect differences. Some retailers even throw in bonus memory cards, so you never know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 retail package comes with a nicely designed single stylus with no spare unit. The stylus is supposed to hang on the lanyard eyelet, as the phone has no compartment to accommodate it. It's pretty inconvenient so it's nice the Pixon12 interface pretty much limits the stylus use to handwriting, so we don't see much need for it to dangle off the handset and get in the way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung M8910 Pixon12 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 Pixon12 is yet another touchscreen device and its design is hardly revolutionary - you know, a big screen on the front and a few buttons below. This form factor doesn't really lend itself to much variation anyway. What's more important, the Pixon12 isn't ashamed of its beginnings and almost exactly copies the original Pixon, especially the camera-centric rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a phone of such skill and prominence, the Pixon12 looks and feels quite a normal medium-sized set. At 108 x 53 x 13.8 mm and 120g of weight, the M8910 Pixon12 is almost the same size and weight as the original M8800 Pixon.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 Pixon12 front is quite sleek with black glass framing the display, while the surface around the controls mimics brushed aluminum to give the set an extra bit of class. Keeping fingerprints away and the secure grip on hardware buttons are an added gain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.1-inch display of the Pixon12 beats the LG Arena screen size-wise, for a random reference, but falls short of the original Pixon and the Apple iPhone 3GS screens. At WVGA 480 x 800 pixels, the M8910 Pixon12 though is quite on the forefront of the market in terms of screen resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resistive screen of the Samsung Pixon12 is sensitive enough. It reacts to even the slightest touch almost as well as a capacitive screen, and you can use anything you want to interact with it - stylus, pencil, gloves, etc. It's far better than anything we've seen on a Windows Mobile device - it's rather close to the iPhone sensitivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not all daisies and sunshine though. In fact, sunshine does make the Pixon12 squint. Sunlight visibility is the same as the Samsung S8000 Jet and far from the best we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, you will be able to see most of the Pixon12 screen on a bright sunny day, but it's far from perfect and users will be struggling under direct sunlight - especially with all them smudges on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But still it's not a make or break thing. The Pixon12 screen legibility is way superior to Sony Ericsson Satio under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three hardware controls below the display - Call and End keys obviously and the center button. Now, the center button does not launch some 3D cube or anything, it just handles the main menu. Pressing and holding it will start the new task manager courtesy of TouchWiz 2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the phone you get the microSD slot and the hardware Lock (Hold) key. On the right side are the volume rocker (zoom lever in camera mode), the tiny new knob that turns the camera on and off and the shutter key. All controls are easy to operate in both single and two-handed use scenarios. We're not sure though the dedicated camera on/off key is essential. The original Pixon had a similar knob launching the gallery - feels right, provided the camera can be switched on and off using the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's worth noting though the camera knob not only overrides the phone lock but will instantaneously turn the camera on regardless of what else is going on at the moment. It does make sense after all in a camera-centric device. Plus, we're talking some sweet start-up time here of less than three seconds. The downside is, the button can be accidentally pressed in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 top side houses the standard microUSB port with a protective cover. The phone charges off the microUSB port - just like most of its recent siblings - and is quite useful as you can leave the charger at home when traveling if you have a computer with you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's more, the lack of 3.5mm audio jack means the microUSB slot is used for connecting the headphones. Luckily, the supplied headset has a 3.5mm jack on the remote, so you can use your own headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the brushed-metal battery cover is a breeze thanks to the release latch at the top. Below the cover hides the standard 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery, which probably is the same unit as the one used in the original Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had quite a rendezvous with the Pixon12 and we dare say we kept it busy. Of course our reviewing routine is harder on a device's battery than average. We ended up charging it overnight on many occasions after a heavy day's use including scores of pictures (most of them flash-free), browsing over Wi-Fi and testing quite a lot of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the 12 megapixel wide camera lens is on the back of the device along with the xenon and Power LED flash. The camera has a lens cover but there's a protective glass on top of it, which of course is vulnerable to scratches and finger smudges. Its role is most probably to protect dust from accumulating beneath the lens cover, where it would be almost impossible to clean. However if the glass eventually gets scratched it will ruin your photos. In fact we lost quite a lot of otherwise good shots due to finger smudges we've made on the lens without knowing. The image quality deteriorates visibly even after a single fingerprint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Samsung Pixon12 hosts a handy grip, which makes the phone perfectly stable in the hand while taking pictures, but adds some bulk along the way - much like the original Pixon. By the way, repeating the original Pixon styling at the back is absolutely reasonable. Cameraphone is its Number One job and the digicam styling makes a good point of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of stereo speakers on the Pixon12 is a shame, as otherwise the device is a very capable portable media player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in spite of its size and weight the Pixon12 is a pretty handy cameraphone and fits the hand almost perfectly. Thanks to the convinient grip, it's great for doubling as a digicam and always ready for some quick snapping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chrome lining on the sides is pretty much all that sets the phone apart from the original Pixon but the upgrade still feels quite a bit more sophisticated. Technically, the Pixon12 screen is smaller but the WVGA resolution and AMOLED technology do raise it well above the original.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz UI 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8910 Pixon12 comes with the latest edition of the home-baked TouchWiz interface. The same interface powers the multimedia flagship of the company's feature phone lineup - the Samsung S8000 Jet. Well technically, there's no Media Gate (the Cube) on the Pixon12 but the rest is pretty much identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did experience lags with some of the previous TouchWiz handsets but the Pixon12 is a whole different story. Responsive and fast, the user interface offers great touch experience, boosted even further by lively icons and nice transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have been keeping track, you would know that the number of available effects has been reduced since the early pre-release samples of the S8000 Jet, but what has remained is still enough to make the Pixon12 quite a treat to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the speed of it, even if it's not publicly announced, the Samsung Pixon12 is probably running the same powerful hardware as the Samsung Jet. Plus, the same exceptionally sensitive screen completes a really responsive and sweetly performing touch device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have made it a tradition not to repeat the same homescreen arrangement twice and the Pixons12 follows suit. This time around, you get three different non-scrollable screens that you can alternate by sideways sweeps. The current selection is indicated by three thin bars at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can fill up each of those homescreens with as many widgets and you can assign a different wallpaper to each screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets are mini-applications that you can use to customize your home screen. One shows the time in two time zones, another has the weather and so on. Even the operator logo is a widget and can be tucked away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widgets are handy like the AccuWeather thingy that shows the local weather and a clock with two time zones. There are others like the 'Go on a diet' or 'Quit smoking' that count the days you've been 'clean'.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are widgets that simply serve as shortcuts to an application, but there are also some widgets that help you run the others. One brings up settings for both the offline widgets (the one that don't need an internet connection) and online widgets (such as the aforementioned AccuWeather) where you can set up the network connections for the online widgets. The other very helpful 'meta' widget help you search for new widgets to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a widget to download launches the browser and directs it to a page with a short description of the widget and a screenshot. At the time of writing, there aren't too many widgets (24 to be more specific) to download but this number should increase as the user (and developer) community grows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the homescreen, Samsung have also rearranged the main menu. It now stretches over three different screens, which are sweep scrollable sideways. The reason that so much more space was needed is the fact that almost all apps are now brought to the main menu, arranged in a flat iPhone-like structure. You will only need to dig deeper for the settings but if those were also to be brought to the fore, the main menu would most certainly have become a huge mess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also given users the option to reshuffle the menu as they like. A press on the small icon at the top right enters Edit mode, which allows you to simply drag each icon to the place you want it. Another tap on the icon and you are good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In both the main menu and the homescreen, you have a button bar at the bottom that shows four keys time - keypad, phonebook, messages and a button to toggle between the homescreen and menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 Pixon12, like most recent Samsung phones, comes complete with multitasking. The task manager gets launched by pressing and holding the hardware Menu key. It has a nice 3D view and a more classical grid one. You can alternate or even close the tasks straight from there. A "End all applications" key is also present in case you don't want to waste time closing application one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A true cheer raiser around the office is the Samsung M8910 Pixon12's Smart unlock feature. First featured on Samsung S5600 and Samsung S5230, Smart unlock allows users to not only unlock the phone but open a menu item or an application, or even dial a contact, just by drawing a letter on the unlock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each letter from A to Z can be set to trigger one of those actions. For instance, you can use it to start features like the music player, messaging, web browser, Java apps or the dialing keypad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is pretty good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 Pixon12 comes with a phonebook that can store up to 2000 contacts with multiple fields. You can assign a photo to each contact, or even a video if you so wish. On the downside, those pics can only be used as caller ID and are not visible in the contact list. You can view contacts in the phone memory, the SIM card, or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 offers two search patterns for the phonebook. The first is the traditional search by typing a part of the contact's name. It doesn't work all that well with the virtual keyboards however. You have one extra click to open the text box to type and only after you tap 'Done' do you get to see the search results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we ended up using the alphabetic scroll most of the time. Quite nicely, Samsung have provided the option to place the scroll bar on either side of the screen to facilitate single-hand usage for both left and right-handed users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frankly, the Pixon12 screen size favors single-handed use anyways but we guess the variable scroll-bar position is still a nice touch. Of course, the kinetic scrolling is also available in the search but it's not quite so convenient in longer lists, is it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pretty glad that this time Samsung found enough space next to contact's names to place a Send Message and a Call button. The photo you may have attached is not displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact there are first and last name fields along with a field for the display name. So you can have a contact appear by his nickname while still keeping the contact's full name on record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another useful feature to avoid duplicate entries is that the phone will display a warning if the number for the new contact you just entered is already in the phonebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo contacts is the alternative<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the recent generations of TouchWiz devices, Samsung have introduced an alternative to the phonebook. While it still relies on the regular contact database, the Photo contacts application might save you the effort of ever entering the phonebook again, once you've filled it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app itself allows you to tag photos, parts of which can be used as shortcuts to various contacts. That might be pretty handy if you are into grouping your contacts. You can take a photo of your colleagues and another one of your buddies and than tag each face to its respective phonebook entry. The next time you want to go out for a drink Friday night all you need to do is call everyone in that photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that when adding a photo, faces are detected automatically but tagging is manual, even if you've already tagged that contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management has its ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 Pixon12 is very good at its main job - making calls. The reception was pretty decent with no interferences during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer gets activated through its reserved shortcut on the homescreen or from the main menu. You can proceed to dial just like you would on any other phone. Unfortunately the smart dial feature works with numbers only, instead of names, which makes it pretty useless. When you punch in some digits, the names whose numbers contain them pop up but we doubt it anyone really remembers just a part of a contact's number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Normally that app should search contacts, whose names contain the letters corresponding to those digits but we guess it will take another device to get that right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As most recent Samsungs, the Pixon12 has another nice accelerometer-based telephony feature. It allows you to mute the ringtone of an incoming call by turning it on its face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 doesn't have a built-in proximity sensor to turn the display off when you hold it next to your year. So it automatically locks each time you start a call and you need to press the unlock button to use the in-call features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>New events like missed calls or incoming messages show up on the homescreen as a widget. It has three tabs each signaling a different type of event. It also displays the sender's number and the time of the call or text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the loudspeaker performance, here is how the Pixon12 ranks alongside some of the other devices we've measured. You can find more details about the test itself, as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8910 Pixon12 messaging department isn't much different from its predecessor. The handset has a shared editor for SMS and MMS and a separate one for emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS editor is the usual intuitive application which allows you to add the recipient from your phonebook, from your recent contacts or enter it manually. You can also add a whole group in the recipient field for mass messages, instead of adding contacts one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messages can be broken down into up to 15 parts for sending if you exceed their maximum character limit (standard 160).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email supports is also duly covered. There's a Gmail icon in the menu but all it does is open the gmail.com webpage in your browser. You might as well use it if you prefer web-based access but the native email client seems the far better option to us. Unfortunately, it didn't automatically detect the settings for Gmail so we had to enter them manually, but once that's done, handling email is a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downloading email limit is 5MB, enough for receiving most types of files. If you receive an office document as an attachment, you will be able to view it as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text input, the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 has three different options to offer. The first one is the traditional thing - typing on a customary (albeit virtual) 3 x 4 alphanumeric keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone on its side automatically expands that numpad to a full-fledged on-screen QWERTY keyboard. The 3.1" display provides enough space for this layout, especially given that the number keys and symbols are in a separate screen that toggles on and off upon a tap. Typing is really comfortable by touchscreen standards, once again the very sensitive display and the haptic feeback count in favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final option is handwriting recognition. While very intuitive and precise in most cases, the lack of embedded stylus is almost ruling out as an option. If you don't mind your stylus dangling on the side of the phone, be our guest.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File browser up to scratch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Customary for the company, the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 is equipped with one of the most elaborate file managers that you can find on a feature phone. It can display the files and folders from the phone memory or the memory card, and even both at once with matching folders nicely brought together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for different types of files (images, video, sounds) and this allows the handset to sort the memory contents. However, you are not forced to follow this structure - you can place your files wherever you want and the phone will have no problems handling them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (except the default folders, like Images, Sounds and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When deleting multiple files you can choose to delete protected images, contact photos and so on. By default those options are off so you won't accidentally delete a contact photo or a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth, again one by one or in bulk. Throughout the whole file manager, you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the Pixon12 has little issues with recognizing memory cards unlike some of its siblings which we reviewed recently. Initialization and reading a 16GB memory card isn't the fastest one around but it isn't frustratingly slow either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery improved<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In line with other recent Samsung handsets, the M8910 Pixon12 has two different picture galleries. They are both optimized for touch operation and very user-friendly, plus this time each sports a cool new view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and accessing it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images. It allows sorting your images by date, type, name, and size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery offers grid, list and a nicely looking zig-zag view layouts. The latter is definitely the most fun to use but it is also certainly the least functional as you need to do quite a lot of scrolling in some folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going through 12 megapixel images is quite fast with the Pixon12, we're just amazed how quickly it's ticking. We've hardly seen a Samsung handset (or any other for that matter) listing numerous thumbnails in a folder so fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open an individual image, you can sweep you fingers across the screen to see the next images without having to return to the image list. It's really fast and it seems the phone pre-caches several images ahead and backwards so swiping your way across the image gallery is always fast and responsive. Alternating portrait and landscape modes is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also implemented the so-called one-finger zooming, which is recently getting new press hype by Samsung. It's marketed as a novel feature, but a version of it has been around for quite some time already on the original Samsung i900 Omnia. This still is the first time we see it implemented on a feature phone - if we don't count the Samsung Jet, of course, but technically, the Pixon12 was announced before the Jet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming is extra simple and takes only a single move of your thumb - you just need to hold it on the screen for a second and then slowly drag your finger up or down for zooming in or out. This method works in both galleries (as well as the web browser) and at first glance it even seems more convenient than the pinching gesture on the iPhone. When we got to play more with it however, we noticed there's an unpleasant lag before the actual zooming starts. It's probably the only aspect where the Pixon12 lags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alternative to the picture gallery is the Media browser (as opposed to the Photo browser found in previous Samsung handsets). It has its dedicated icon in the main menu and is the quickest way to access your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the regular grid view, the Media browser adds another cool view mode which is pretty convenient for flipping through tons of images with your finger, while getting a tiny preview of each one of them at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the two galleries also have another Samsung proprietary accelerometer-based feature. It lets you browse pictures in fullscreen landscape mode by simply tilting your phone up and down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the tilt scrolling has been improved to a point that it is acceptable and quite usable. It is a great improvement over the rather annoying implementation in previous handsets that we have tested. But still, that feature is more of a gimmick and among the less practical things we've seen in the image gallery ever since it was first introduced on the original Pixon.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player slightly refreshed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player usually found on Samsung devices has received a minor face-lift on the M8910 Pixon12. It sports slightly different icons when browsing your tracks and a new way of displaying album art in Now Playing mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new option here is the '5.1 ch' button which, when activated, makes the player do its best to emulate 5.1 channel sound on normal stereo headphones. There are quite a few equalizer presets available, but sadly, there's no option to set up a custom equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on, the three different visualizations are a nice touch to the music player and the album browser (quite like the one on Omnia HD) takes after Apple's Cover Flow, something we quite appreciate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but certainly not least, the player is nicely touch-optimized for fast forward and rewind, just like the Pixon. This adds up to an excellent music application that can fully replace your portable MP3 player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player widget is cool, allowing quick access to the full version of the application by only a single tap. You can also start, stop and skip tracks straight on the home screen if you prefer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple and nice to use FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 Pixon12 features an FM radio with RDS. The advanced RDS allows displaying the station name on one row and some additional info on the other. It is complemented by a user-friendly and easily thumbable interface with several large buttons appearing on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 can automatically search and save all the available stations in your area. Alternative frequencies of a given station are automatically detected too, so you don't have to retune manually when traveling. There's an option to record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 radio comes complete with an integrated music recognition feature called Find Music, which works much like Sony Ericsson's TrackID.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you won't bother hitting the menu, the Radio widget on the homescreen gives you more immediate access. Tapping on it brings up the radio or you could just use the widget's controls to start/stop the radio or change the station. It can only jump saved stations though, and if you want to search you'll have to do it in the application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of stations, you can save stations but they are labeled by just their frequency and can't be renamed. There's a separate list for your favorite stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is another noteworthy application. It has a nice touch-optimized interface and all the essentials are covered. It can play video files in fullscreen landscape mode (auto-rotated of course) and you can fast-forward and rewind videos in the same way as the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player even provides the same 5.1 channel option when you plug in a headset. It also allows direct uploading of a video on the web.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 Pixon12 has no problem playing VGA or even 720x480 videos at 30 fps. Not a great surprise but worth noting since compressing videos to view on mobile devices can be a time-consuming business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best parts about the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 video player is its DivX and XviD support. This means you no longer need to convert your videos to play them on your handset - just get them onboard and you are good to go.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Taking the 12 megapixel camera out for a spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you checked out our previews last week you've probably already seen the Pixon12 camera in action. It's a worthy piece of equipment and the first of its kind to hit the shelves. Now that we had some more time to play with it, we managed to put it through a series of tests that showed its performance in more detail. We also completed a little shootout between it and the Nokia N86 8MP, which at this point some people find as the Pixon12 toughest rival (at least before the Sony Ericsson Satio gets released).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardware</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8910 Pixon12 sports a maximum image resolution of 4000 x 3000 pixels. It's an autofocus unit and boasts both xenon and LED flash. Those give the Pixon12 both an extra edge in extreme low light conditions and the video light functionality that's otherwise impossible with a xenon unit. A brief flash shootout (including the xenon-equipped Sony Ericsson C905) follows towards the end of the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Monitoring the user feedback of our two Pixon12 previews we noticed an interesting trend among the active photo critics on the web - somehow it became very fashionable to claim that the megapixel count is hardly that of an advantage. You know - that it's all about the quality of lens and stuff. While this is undoubtedly true in theory and in practice with some dedicated digital cameras, it is not quite so with the cameraphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The truth is that more than often manufacturers purchase in bulk the entire camera modules, including the lens, the sensor and some of the processing hardware. Then, all they do is tune the output by tweaking the processing settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the reason why the 12MP camera modules come with higher quality lens than the 8MP ones, which in turn most of the time outdo the 5MP modules and so on. Having tested our fair share of cameraphones we can safely conclude that it is extremely rare for a lower-resolution cameraphone to produce better photos quality than a higher-res one. So, in fact the megapixels mean something. Well, maybe not as much as the marketing tries to convince us but they do have an impact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung marketed the M8910 Pixon12 as sporting 28mm (in 35mm terms) wide-angle lens just as the Nokia N86 8MP. For those of you unfamiliar with the material, the 28mm lens gives you roughly 20 percent wider angle of view when looking in the viewfinder. As it turned out, the Pixon12 camera is actually using a 30mm, rather than 28mm lens, which is still wider than the 35mm competition but not what Samsung promised (and less than what Nokia N86 delivers). This was confirmed by both our field tests and the EXIF data recorded by the Pixon12 itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting discovery we made reviewing the Pixon12 is that it comes with a variable aperture like the Nokia N86. The Pixon12 however only offers two aperture values compared to the three available on the Nokia N86.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 shoots at F/2.64 to let a standard amount of light in and stops down to F/3.61 when light conditions allow it. Technically the photos at smaller apertures (indicated by a larger F-stop value) should be sharper and with greater depth of field than those at larger ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as on the Nokia N86 8MP though, Samsung didn't provide any kind of manual control over the aperture value. The handset decides which of the two values to use automatically. That is as good as it gets for almost every user out there, but why not give the few enthusiasts the choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the rarity of the variable aperture in the cameraphone world we are surprised Samsung didn't mention the feature at the announcement. Due to the automatic nature of the aperture control we couldn't actually test whether the shots taken at F/3.61 are indeed sharper or not. Since Samsung have not included the variable aperture in their marketing materials, it's a fair guess the difference shouldn't be that huge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User interface and features</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 is pretty well geared when it comes to software features too. The basic anti-shake digital image stabilization, geotagging and viewfinder gridlines are all there and so is face detection, smile shot and blink detection. The ISO sensitivity can go as high as 1600.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 sports the Smart auto mode, which picks the best scene preset according to the shooting conditions and the subject much like the LG GC900 Viewty Smart (LG called it Intelligent shot). Compared to the regular auto mode, Smart auto gives the phone control over many more of the phone settings such as contrast, color balance, saturation, etc. thus tweaking the output to a far greater extent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 sports tracking touch focus similarly to the iPhone 3GS. All you need to do is hold your finger over the subject you want to focus on and watch the cross-hairs follow it in the viewfinder. Once you press the shutter key, it will lock focus and proceed to capture the actual shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is just about the same as on the original Samsung Pixon. Nicely touch optimized and surely one of the most comfortable camera interfaces on a touchscreen device so far, it also excels in terms of speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore the image saving process is also very quick as a 12MP photo only takes slightly more than a second to be recorded. With the automatic preview turned off, this could lead to some remarkable shot to shot time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Against Canon 350D and Nokia N86</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last week we made two impromptu shootouts with the Samsung M8910 Pixon12. For the first one we went out of our usual ways, putting the handset against the good old Canon 350D DSLR camera and the point-and-shoot A610. A lot of readers were unhappy back then that we used a cheap ultra-zoom lens on the DSLR. So this time we went for the noticeably better Sigma 10-20 for the comparison. The aperture was stopped down to make out the most of the lens potential - F11 in one of the samples, F7.1 in the other, and all the crops are made from the central part of the image where the lens does best. We are throwing in Nokia N86 in the uneven battle too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And outrageous as it may seem, we are still standing behind our last-week statement that under ideal lighting conditions, the 12MP cameraphone resolves as much detail as the 4 year-old 8MP Canon 350D DSLR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And before you go quoting us left and right without mentioning the proper context, please note that we are talking about resolved detail only and we are NOT saying that this really is an equal game when it comes to noise levels or dynamic range. The large sensor counts big time when it comes to those, placing the DSLR in an entirely different league. But nevertheless a comparison like that is still a pretty good reference of the progress cameraphones are making.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, seeing the contenders side-by-side you can see why we are excited, the Samsung Pixon12 is so much smaller and it's something you will always have with you, which is certainly not the case with the DSLR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also revisit our first Pixon12 vs 350D shootout over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Against Nokia N86</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next day resorting to our time-tested methods, we stood the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 against the Nokia N86 8MP. The Nokia N86 8MP cannot deliver 12 MP photos and lacks some of the software extras of the Pixon12, but sports a wider-angle lens as we mentioned and the rest of the features are pretty much on par.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yeah, we know that the Sony Ericsson Satio is the only other 12 megapixel cameraphone and as such might has its right to be here. However the Satio is still in development and its camera needs more tuning before it is ready to face such a challenge. Rest assured though that we will do our best to compare those, once the Satio becomes available (or even gets close to releasing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolution advantage is obvious in all of the samples. While not a bad cameraphone, the N86 doesn't have any edge over Pixon12 in any of the image quality aspects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 resolves visibly more detail with the colors a bit more accurate than the Nokia. The noise levels are pretty much on par on both devices so you can rest assured that the dozen of megapixels doesn't have a negative impact on the image quality and instead, they're only bringing benefits to the table. By the way, despite the increased resolution the processing speed and usability on Pixon are also better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the dynamic range seems better on the Nokia than on the Pixon12. On several occasions the Samsung lost more information in both the shadows and the highlights. But that may as well be the Pixon12 applying too much contrast enhancement in the processing algorithm set in the default Auto mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the contrary the Nokia N86 produced less contrasty photos, but that can be easily fixed with post-processing on a computer if need be. However bringing back information lost due to highlight clipping (such is the case of Pixon12) is impossible. On the other hand if you aren't much into post-processing your photos you might as well like the punchier Pixon12 output better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Against Nokia N86 in low light</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took a couple of shots to test both cameras' low light performance. The EXIF data on both photos shows ISO200, so the results are perfectly comparable. The Pixon12 resolution advantage diminishes in those conditions but it has still has produced a photo with more detail. So much for the "more cramped 12MP sensors perform worse in low light" theory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Against Sony Ericsson C905 and Nokia N86 - flash</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next in line is the promised flash shootout where we also included the Sony Ericsson C905, which is considered to have one of the most powerful flash units on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turns out the Samsung Pixon12 again produces better results than its 8MP contenders. Sony Ericsson C905 puts up a good fight, but Nokia N86 with its incomparably weaker LED flash (be it 3rd generation or whatever) can't come anywhere closer to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Against Sony Ericsson C905 - flash macro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Sony Ericsson C905 and the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 produced good results here - they manage to reduce the flash output and the images have turned out pretty usable. The Pixon12 takes more conservative approach by not allowing any highlight clipping, but this has resulted in a slightly darker image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are also welcome to check out the shootout from our second Pixon12 preview. Next to its S8300 UltraTOUCH and i8510 INNOV8 siblings it does look a clear winner. The resolution it provides is superior, the color rendering is more accurate and the 30mm lens is easily our choice for a walk-around camera. Actually, we prefer 28mm or even 24mm but among those cameraphones we'd take the Pixon12 any day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More Samsung M8910 Pixon12 camera samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung M8910 Pixon12. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In conclusion, we have to admit that we are pleasantly surprised by the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 camera performance. The high resolution, the decent noise levels and precise colors are its best assets and we are really pleased with the result. Furthermore from about a couple hundred photos that we took with the Pixon12 there are very few that are unusable (not counting those ruined by smudgy fingers on the lens). And that's a respectable achievement, indeed.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video recording of the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 failed to impress as much as its still image quality. It manages D1 videos at 30 fps but the quality isn't anywhere near the best Samsung have pulled off recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we aren't even talking the HD-capable Samsung Omnia HD here. The Samsung Pixon12 isn't even close to the S8300 UltraTOUCH, which is admittedly one of the best in the D1 category. We can pretty much say the VGA@30fps video by Nokia N86 8MP is better than the Pixon12 results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now don't get us wrong here - it's not that bad with the videos turning out usable on most occasions, it's just that we were in for a "wow" rather than an "oh" effect. The colors are washed out, and the resolved detail can hardly be called high (and you can tell the video bitrate is almost 4x lower than in S8300 videos). We may be too demanding here but with a still camera like that we just hoped for the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video taken with the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 camera so you can see for yourselves</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity packs it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 Pixon12 is perfectly capable of providing worldwide roaming with its quad-band GSM support. The 3G coverage is not as perfect with just the 900/2100 bands onboard. Luckily the phone supports both HSDPA up to 7.2Mbps and HSDPA to guarantee the fastest data speeds available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is also available and comes with A2DP, which is no news on even lower end phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is quite welcome as it's a lot more popular than the proprietary port the previous gen Samsung phones used to come with. You can set up the phone to connect in mass storage mode or PC suite mode (Media player) or to prompt each time it's connected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In mass storage mode it gives access to the memory card but not to the internal memory and you cannot use the phone for calls or data in this mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To round it all off, the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 is WLAN enabled. It sports a nice Wi-Fi manager that makes it easy to add an access point to your list, while throwing some nice graphics at the same time. The problem is that you need to update each application's profile every time you want to use it with a different access point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means that if you are at work and you have set your browser to use your office Wi-Fi network, you will have to reach for the profiles when you go home and switch to your own network, or if you want to use it over 3G. We really hope Samsung will come up with a more intuitive solution to automatically handle the networks currently available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is up for the challenge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8910 Pixon12 and the Samsung S8000 Jet are the two pioneers of the new WebKit-based Dolfin web browser, which is an in-house developed application. With full Flash support and the new one-finger zooming, it is one of the finest web browsers we have seen so far (especially on a feature phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new web browser allows up to 5 pages to be open at the same time. Multiple downloads in the background are also supported and there is also a built-in AdBlocker. Unluckily, it tends to run out of resources pretty fast, displaying a warning with only three not really heavy sites opened simultaneously. We cannot quite see it managing the promised five pages but then again we don't really use that many on a cell phones usually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one-finger zooming works like a charm. Of course you can also rely on double tapping a block of text or an image and the handset will automatically zoom in on it. Another double tap and you are back to the previous zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of Flash and Java support, the new web browser also offers kinetic scrolling and fullscreen view mode. In all fairness, the kinetic scrolling is somewhat bumpy and not as smooth as on the iPhone but it still does the job.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer fully equipped<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8910 Pixon12 has a good number of useful time-managing applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. You can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday. However, with the Pixon12 there are only two types of events available in the calendar. You can set the starting date and time of the event and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm is quite customizable. You can set up to 10 alarms, each with the following configurable options - custom ringtone, volume, repetition days and name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator of the Samsung M8910 is pretty much as basic as it gets. Among the other organizer offerings are a voice recorder and a unit converter. The voice recorder limit is 60 minutes. A countdown timer and a stopwatch come in useful too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also to-do and memo applications for taking down tasks and notes. You can also use the memo widget to place a memo on the homescreen where you're unlikely to forget it. The widget and the application are separate so don't expect your memos to automatically pop up on screen. There's a to-do widget as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Video editor also deserves a mention. It can handle videos of up to D1 resolution and there's the option to edit them - trimming, splitting or inserting text. You can even use photos instead of videos - you just set the time for them to be on screen (from 1 to 30 seconds).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The world clock allows you to quickly check out the time in any given time zone around the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, one of the most important applications of the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 organizer is the office document viewer that supports Word, Excel, Powerpoint and PDF files. It's an application produced by Access and is one of the nicest additions to the software package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The document viewer is quick enough when opening files; however, panning is rather slow. The document viewer also works in landscape mode (once again, rotating the screen automatically), which makes reading a little easier.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 builds on the original Pixon and adds navigation capabilities to the built-in GPS receiver. It comes with the Samsung Mobile Navigator preinstalled which is a full-fledged SatNav solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application itself is something we've seen before but its presence on a feature phone certainly is still considered news. This also is yet another evidence that the differences are getting blurred.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Mobile Navigator is in fact a regular Route66 product, so you can be quite sure that its functionality and map data is sufficient. It has voice-guided navigation and a huge number of extras, but the goodies come at an extra cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The voice guided navigation and the weather service, traffic info and safety cameras info, travel guides and so on came unlocked on our device with a one-year license. We are guessing though that this will be strictly market dependant. Purchased separately, a one-year voice-guided navigation license for a given region costs about 70 euro.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games to try and buy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical Samsung, the Pixon12 offers a bunch of trial games. Entertaining though they might be, they can only keep you occupied for a short while and the full versions have to be bought for a small fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Samsung didn't bother putting any fun and entertaining games in the handset, we don't see the need to get into any detail about the demos offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only game section that isn't a trial is called Rollercoaster Rush. The Java title uses the built-in accelerometer for control and ranks decently on the fun scale.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There you go - the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 is the next stage in cameraphone evolution and you're welcome to take it and use it. Cameraphones are still some way behind point-and-shoot digicams and seriously, catching up is not the point. The thing is if everything else was getting better at the pace handsets are evolving, we'd be living in a better world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, real success for cameraphones would not be to kick digicams out of the market but simply match their image quality. We guess the Pixon12 is here to say this might not be as impossible as previously thought. Optical zoom and more user control over more features are still the difference makers but with Samsung M8920 in the works, we're looking out to another leap forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the Pixon12, we're looking at a handset that has plenty to offer. The vibrant and sensitive screen, lively and snappy interface and rich connectivity make it a great package all around. Its initial pricing is steep all right: topping the cost of big-shot smartphone all-in-ones. Not to mention that this kind of cash gets you a reasonable digicam and a good enough phone. Oh well, being at the cutting edge of technology never comes cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 is winner stuff but we guess we need to define win here. It's not the kind of handset to make insane sales - the price tag, the novelty, the top industry position will rather connect with the "insane purchase" kind of mentality. But it sure is handsets like the Pixon12 that make a company's name. Let's judge the Pixon12 by the competition it keeps busy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP also sports a pretty powerful camera, image processing being its main weakness for now. However a firmware update might turn the tables, so it will be Symbian S60 power against the extra four megapixels, smartphone vs touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N86 8MP</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's own i8910 Omnia HD is another heavyweight cameraphone by Samsung which trades the 12megapixel stills for HD video recording and S60 5th edition OS. It doesn't have as sensitive a screen, but size does matter and the HD sure gets the upper hand. The wide angle variable aperture lens however is definitely earning a point for the Pixon12 plus the OmniaHD is quite large and not every one would be willing to lug it around in his pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i8910 Omnia HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon12 will also have to play a couple of rounds against the Sony Ericsson Satio (or Idou if you prefer), once the latter makes it to the ring. They both sport some advanced 12 megapixel shooters, with the Satio again on the smarter side of phones with its S60 5th edition OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Satio (a.k.a. Idou)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the LG GC900 Viewty Smart will also cross paths with the Pixon12. A few months headstart to the users, the S-Class equipped LG cameraphone sports a lower-res shooter but matches everything else. With LG presumably also working on a 12-megapixel shooter, users are in for plenty of action in the ultimate cameraphone category.</paragraph>
