			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W950 is an exciting new addition to the Walkman series of Sony Ericsson. It is a smartphone based on the Symbian 9.1 UIQ 3.0 with a stylish and yet classical design. Although it doesn?t feature a camera, the 4GB of free space and the dedicated multimedia keys would make any music lover jump from joy. The large touchscreen TFT display with QVGA resolution is just another fascinating feature for the tech buffs. It seems that the W950 has got what it takes to overtake the high-end music phones market and it is our job to see how it performs in every possible aspect.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main advantages:<subsectionTitle>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W950 seems like the utmost music phone in its pure form. The whopping 4GB of internal memory are enough to store all the tracks you love to listen to. The addition of dedicated music keys that come alive when you start the player is just great. Moreover, all this comes in a rather compact body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson W950</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the 4GB of storage memory might make you think of Nokia N91, in fact the Nokia handset has more to offer such as a 2 megapixel camera and Wi-Fi. Nevertheless, N91 is much bigger and weighs a hefty 50 g more. Therefore, there is no room for comparison between the two and we would not make such attempt in our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W950 retail package includes a USB cable and a Walkman stereo headset with a remote control. Of course, as with any other mobile phone, the contents of the retail package remain strictly market and country dependant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo headset that comes in the package in fact is standard one with a 3.5 mm jack. The remote control itself, also bearing the stylish Walkman logo, is an adapter so you may even opt for using your regular 3.5 mm headphones with W950.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   W950 retail package stereo headset</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W950 boasts a solid construction and a stylishly designed body made out of matt plastic along with silver lining and orange highlights. Thanks to those, the orange Walkman theme has been kept all over the handset, while keeping successfully away from the flamboyant styling of some of the previous Walkman phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Measuring at 106 x 54 x 15 mm, the W950 could be hardly called a compact phone, but as far as smartphones go, it is in fact pretty slim. The probable reason for that is the absence of a camera. When it comes to width though, our friend has lot more to show. But width is essential in order to be able to use comfortably the Jog Dial single-handedly. And you may agree, that is of great importance since besides the stylus, it is the only way to navigate through the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to Sony Ericsson P990, the Jog Dial can no longer be used in five directions as in Sony Ericsson P910. Now the only available directions are scroll up, scroll down and press. We think that the 5-way Jog Dial was a great navigation tool and stripping it of two of its functions would most surely disappoint many people that are already used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, beside the Jog Dial, the left side of the body features only a Back button used for exiting the current menu. The left side is also the one from where you can pull out the stylus, which plugs in into a special slot in the phone?s body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W950 left side: Jog Dial, Back button and stylus visible</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone features only a dual volume key and a dedicated stop/play key for the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  W950 right side: volume and stop/play buttons visible</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper part of the body incorporates the on/off key and the Infrared port while the bottom end features the Fast Port used for charging and for plugging in the headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W950 top and bottom part: Infrared port and Fast port visible</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back part of the handset is rather bare in fact. The only visible elements are the loudspeaker grill in orange, the Sony Ericsson logo and the cap on the external antenna jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  W950 back view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover reveals the standard Sony Ericsson BST-33 Lithium-Polymer battery with a capacity of 900 mAh. According to the manufacturer, it should last up to 2.5 hours of talk time in UMTS networks and up to 7.5 hours in regular GSM networks. The expected standby time varies from up to 250 hours in UMTS networks to up to 340 hours in GSM ones. The battery should also be enough for up to 10 hours of listening to music. Unfortunately, we couldn?t test the phone?s battery life since we used the phone heavily during our tests and thus the battery life we experienced was not indicative for the real-life performance of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card slot is in the upper part. You simply plug it in and when you have to take it out, you should pull out the metal tray protruding from the slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Battery cover removed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the front panel would probably arouse much more interest. Most of it is taken by the 2.6? touchscreen display. Above it is the in-call speaker grill again with an orange highlight. Below the display, there is the Walkman logo and the keypad.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The keypad itself is rather innovative both in technology and in design; at least as much as the mobile phones? world is concerned. The keys are level but have a good reaction to pressing ? in general, the feedback is sure and positive. Each key has a small protruding dot that would help you work with the keypad without looking at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting solution in W950 is that there are no conventional navigation keys. Navigating trough the menu options is carried out either with the help of the stylus or with the side Jog-Dial and Back button. The keypad also lacks the standard keys for receiving or ending calls ? for that purpose you would again have to use either the Jog Dial or the touchscreen. A nice thing about the touchscreen is that you can use it for the basic functions without taking out the stylus ? a simple press with your thumb would do since the most important on-screen keys are made large enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the regular alphanumeric keys, there is also a dedicated Music player key on the left marked with the Walkman logo and a correction C on the right. The alphanumeric keys have a white backlighting while the Walkman key and the C key have an orange one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you turn on the Music player a new row of keys lights up ? those are the three dedicated multimedia keys REW, STOP/PLAY, and FFW.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   W950 keypad: multimedia keys visible in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is ok when typing slowly and you take your time to make sure that you press each key strong enough, but when it comes to writing regular messages at regular speed it can easily turn your life into hell. The innovative design of the keys in fact provides for their highly inconvenient use. You are almost sure to make writing mistakes all the time unless you take your time and write very carefully.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone, however, is really comfortable for everyday use and feels great when held in hand. The added millimeters in width in fact provide for a very good grip and the weight of 112 g feels just fine. Besides the nagging writing problem, we might say that it?s one of the most comfortable smartphones to use and carry with you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W950 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen display of Sony Ericsson W950 is pretty large with a diagonal of 2.6?. It supports 262K colors and works in QVGA (240 x 320 pixels) resolution. Unfortunately, it doesn?t do so well under direct sun light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W950 display ? the phone in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As anyone could expect, W950 offers nice signal reception strength and we found no problems during calls. The vibration is on a medium level, while the ringing volume is more than enough to alert you of incoming calls even in a noisy street.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone?s interface is UIQ 3.0, which is a customizable stylus-based user interface for media-rich mobile phones that is based on the Symbian OS 9.1 OS. Besides regular clock, date, signal strength and battery meter, the standby mode offers the user a Today screen and a customizable shortcuts bar. The Today screen shows current Calendar events, message and email inbox, missed calls, general notes, etc. It is directly accessible by pressing the Jog-Dial. By default the shortcuts bar allows access to the Calendar, the phonebook, the web browser, the message inbox and the main menu. The shortcut items can be selected with the stylus as well as with your finger since the graphic icons are large enough for the purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Standby mode with Today screen expanded and collapsed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In standby, there are also two pop-up menus. The first one can be invoked by the More softkey and the second one can be opened by pressing with the stylus the triangle in the upper left corner. The first one offers the option to turn on a connectivity feature, change the volume, view the smartphone?s status, and allows access to a call management option for filtering incoming calls. The other one gives you access to the most important items or actions you may need or like to do ? for example, turn on connectivity options such as Bluetooth or Infrared, make a new call, add a new contact or put down some appointments and notes. Furthermore, it gives you access to the dual time zone clock and allows you to control the volume level for different events centrally. We are very pleased with this menu since it allows quick access to the most important functions of any smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Pop-up menus ? Time zone manager with alarms</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice thing is that the smartphone has a dedicated Flight mode, which can be turned on seamlessly without even restarting the phone. Even if you have to turn it off for some reason, there is an option that the phone asks you whether you want to start it directly into Flight mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu of the Sony Ericsson W950 allows you two different views such as icons grid or list view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone interface can be customized through various graphic themes. We find the default orange Walkman theme very pleasing to the eye but still there are other graphic themes that may freshen up the things for you when you get fed up with it. Several of them come preinstalled while many more should be available online once the phone becomes publicly available.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W950 offers an extensive phonebook designed to suit everybody?s needs. It can store unlimited amount of numbers. You can choose to filter your contacts by groups; by the location, they are saved at; or separate them into individual folders that later on you can use for calls management. The default filter applied shows the contacts saved in the phone?s memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contacts list ? applying list filters ? filtering calls</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The details that you can save for a given contact are abundant and include several numbers and email addresses, job title, office and home postal addresses, voice commands for the individual phone numbers of the contact and finally you can associate a ringtone and a picture to the specific contact. There is a field to enter the contact?s birthday and contrary to Sony Ericsson W950, the entered date does get transferred to the Calendar. A nice feature is that you can add your own custom fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contact Dexter?s details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even add a note for every contact. As usual, the font size throughout the most of the smartphone?s interface can be zoomed in. That?s a great feature for people that no longer enjoy their full-strength eyesight. Otherwise, the smallest of the font sizes is pretty legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Adding a sample note for Dexter</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Call log lists store all the information about the calls received or made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Outgoing calls list ? a specific call details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, when it comes to call management, besides call filtering there are also two nice options. The first one is to set the smartphone to send a SMS with a predefined text whenever you have to reject a call. The second one is to automatically store a callback event in the calendar every time your reject a call. In case you choose that option, you can set how many minutes after the call the call back event should alert you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Setting up the Reject with SMS option ? setting the call back option</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>But when you want it written<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Usually the messaging department is one of strongest ones in any smartphone. Sony Ericsson W950 doesn?t make any exception to the rule. It offers rich functions combined with several text-input options. You can enter text with the numeric keypad in the usual Multi-Tap way, use the virtual QWERTY keyboard with the stylus or simply write with the stylus on the screen. As regards handwriting recognition, the phone manages very well. If you feel uncomfortable with it, you can always turn on the virtual keyboard, which is rather easy to use and offers different layouts. The Sony Ericsson W950 also offers an enhanced version of the T9 dictionary ? its thesaurus is expandable ? you can add your own words and it can even remember whole messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Setting up text input options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging menu combines all messages in one inbox. The supported messages are SMS, EMS, MMS, email, and RSS feeds. The last one is available through a dedicated application. Writing a sms with the plethora of input methods available is rather easy. Furthermore, you have a lot of emoticons to express graphically your feelings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Shared Inbox ? using the virtual keypad ? SMS emoticons ? EMS emoticons</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The font size in the conventional messages can be varied according to your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is not really a separate application. It has extensive options but setting it up to work with your email account is rather easy. It supports the POP3, IMAP and SMTP protocols, as well as SSL and TLS encryption. Writing an email is as simple as writing a standard sms message. Usually the client downloads only the email headers or you can set it up to automatically download the whole messages if they don?t exceed a predefined limit in kilobytes. Adding an attachment is easy as usual ? all you have to do is open the corresponding tab in the ?new email? editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Email account settings</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Manipulating the contents<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W950 has 64MB flash memory and 64MB RAM besides the 4GB available as a separate storage space. There is no way to expand the memory by using a memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone offers a nice file manager, which resembles a lot the interface of the file managers of Sony Ericsson non?OS phones. It has two tabs ? one showing the folders in the phone?s memory (no system files visible) and another one showing the files and folders on the 4GB storage memory. You can mark multiple files or folders and then copy, move or send them to another device. There is full support for DRM (Digital Rights Management) protection. It can be applied to all types of multimedia content such as audio, video, images and Java midlets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Browsing folders ? folder context menu ? Other folder ? available space</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing through pictures though, is much easier through the Picture gallery application. It offers almost the same folders &amp; files interface as the file manager but it has some additional options as well as several view settings. You can browse the pictures in portrait or landscape mode. You can also set whether you want the pictures in portrait mode to be seen fullscreen. When browsing in landscape mode the fullscreen is the only available option. Of course, you can zoom in the pictures to their original size and even more. When zooming, a mini-map appears which allows you to see which picture area you are looking at.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>And finally Walkman...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is the same as the one used in the Walkman-branded Sony Ericsson phones. Well, not quite. In fact, Sony Ericsson W950 boasts one of the most developed music players we have seen in a mobile phone. Of course, it supports playlists with shuffle and loop options while offering the usual equalizer presets including the Walkman MegaBass one. The dedicated music player key on the keypad along with the multimedia keys, that come alive once you have started the player, really make the life easier for the user - not that we would expect any less than that when we are talking about a Walkman-branded mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Playing a song ? Loading an album ? Equalizer presets ? Filtering tracks by Artist</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nice innovations are the several animated background visualizations, which are a very nice touch, by the way. An added way to sort all your music is by using the added rating and mood designations. First, you can add ratings to the songs and then filter the available tracks by their rating. The mood designation, on the other hand, means that after adding a corresponding mood to your tracks you can later on filter the songs and virtually listen only to those that suit your current mood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Available visualizations ? Adding mood or rating ? Available moods ? Filtering tracks by mood</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player also offers a sleep timer allowing it to turn off automatically after a user-defined period. One of the coolest things about the player is that you can scroll through your tracks a lot easier using the side Jog Dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external speaker as well as the stereo headset provides a nice listening experience ? nothing less than one would expect from a Walkman phone. The speaker manages to sound very mild and pleasant although lacking substantial bass element. The headphones don?t have that problem at all and sounded more than satisfying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Video Player application offers basic functionality. A nice feature is that you can watch your videos in landscape mode at fullscreen view. According to the manufacturer, the Sony Ericsson W950 is able to play smoothly videos with VGA resolution, captured at 30 fps, which is more than enough to watch a music video or even a movie. Besides the usual mobile formats such as 3GPP, the smartphone supports MP3, AAC+, MPEG-4 and Real Audio 9 and RealMedia formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Video Player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo FM radio that the W950 is equipped with supports RDS and can store up to 20 radio stations. If the radio station has RDS broadcasts, it gets stored in the phone?s memory with its name. The equalizer presets as well as the sleep function and the visualizations that are available for the Music player are available for the FM radio, too. This again makes it one of the most developed FM radio applications we have seen in a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Tuning in a station ? Browsing stations with the Jog Dial ? FM radio options ? RDS options </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity means much<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connecting the W950 smartphone to a computer or other devices, you have various options. You can use the integrated Infrared port, a USB cable or the Bluetooth 2.0 functionality. Connecting the smartphone to a PC via the Bluetooth worked like a charm. The Bluetooth capabilities of the device include also support for the A2DP profile, which allows you to use a stereo Bluetooth headset for listening to music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization with the PC or remote server via SyncML also works seamlessly. The user can choose items to be synchronized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Remote sync options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides Infrared and Bluetooth, the W950 has tri-band GSM/UMTS support (GSM 900/1800/1900) and supports GPRS for fast data transfers in non-3G enabled networks. EDGE (the so-called E-GPRS) support lacks here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W950 comes equipped with the famous Opera 8.0 web browser, which has made a reputation as one of the best for mobile devices. It supports HTML, XHTML, JavaScript, frames, CSS, and TSL and SSL security protocols.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Opera web browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users can quickly and easily switch between portrait and landscape modes as well as change from a normal view with scroll bars to a full screen view. Furthermore, you can use the Text mode option to reformat pages to exclude pictures and thus save some of those precious megabytes you pay your network carrier for. We are pretty happy with the browser capabilities but it must be noted that the Web browser that comes with the Nokia Symbian smartphones with the S60 3rd edition user interface outperforms it with an ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Web browser in landscape fullscreen mode</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>But it can do a lot more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alarms application is nothing special really but it does its job more than satisfactory. You can set a ringtone of your choice as an Alarm sound or you can have a given radio station to wake you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the Calendar application is at a good level. You can choose between monthly, weekly and daily view and two time zones. The available events that you can store are Appointment, Reminder, All day event, and Anniversary. The birthday can be recorded as an Anniversary event since those events are repeated automatically through the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Calendar: monthly, weekly and daily view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any other Sony Ericsson phones you have two other applications to organize your daily routine ? that is the Tasks and Notes applications. The Task one allows you to enter simple events that do not require extensive setups as the ones in the Calendar. The Notes application allows saving short notes as the name itself implies. The interesting thing here is that the notes can be in handwritten form. When using the regular input method, the predictive text input mode is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Tasks ? normal note ? handwritten text note ? handwritten drawing note </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W950 also offers a nicely designed Calculator, Unit converter and a Sound Recorder with a recording time only limited by the available memory. Sony Ericsson has decided to leave the MusicDJ application seen on almost all of their mobile phones ? it allows you to create polyphonic ringtones within a simple user interface. For an unknown reason the VideoDJ application seen on some of the latest Sony Ericsson mobiles lacks here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Calculator ? Unit converter ? Sound recorder ? MusicDJ</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe this is the most appropriate place to say a few things about the Task Manager, which is something of a separate application although fully integrated into the OS. The Task Manager icon is available in the upper right angle of the screen almost throughout the whole smartphone interface. You probably have noticed that on almost all of our screenshots. Unfortunately, the icon itself is so small that the only way to press it is by using the stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Task Manager has two tabs ? the first and default one, which you see whenever you open the Manager contains shortcuts to the Main Menu and the Activity menu as well as access to the recently used application. The second tab of the Task Manager contains all the currently running applications and allows you to terminate them easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Shortcut tab of the Manager ? Running applications tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Sony Ericsson W950 doesn?t have the Quickoffice application preinstalled which would allow it to open or even edit MS Word, MS Excel and MS PowerPoint documents. According to us, it is a great disadvantage since every smartphone should be able to deal with office documents. Of course, you can always add such an application but usually you have to pay for it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Strategic gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W950 comes with two preinstalled games. The first one is the Tetris-like QuadraPop game seen on many other Sony Ericsson phones. We must point out though, that it is an enhanced version of the game with a serious face lifting done to its interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second game is Nightclub Empire, which is a sort of a tycoon game where you start as an owner of a nightclub and begin developing it as a business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    W950 games</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the end, it all comes to your priorities. Sony Ericsson W950 is a great smartphone, a great phone, and a great music player. That is if you don?t expect your mobile phone to take pictures and you are not much into messaging. That great display would have put to a good use a Wi-Fi capability but it would have added to the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s up to you to decide whether this is the right smartphone for you, but if you are into listening to music, the Sony Ericsson W950 is among the best solutions on the market.</paragraph>
