			<paragraph>Spoiler alert: the results of the voting are revealed below. It's not too late to check out the camera samples on the second page with an open mind and pick your favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to everyone who voted on the blind shootout! We made it more difficult this time around by concealing the FoV of the different phones, but we saw some very accurate guesses in the comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below you'll find the results of the voting and the full resolution shots we used for the comparison (without resizing to hide the FoV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start by unveiling the mystery phone. Many guessed "Xperia Z5" and were fairly close - it is a Sony camera, except not in a Sony phone. The fourth phone, D, in the blind shootout was the Meizu PRO 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other three were as follows: A is the Samsung Galaxy Note5, B is the Huawei Nexus 6P and C is the LG V10. And of the three a very clear winner emerged, though it was actually the Meizu that snagged the first couple of victories.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#1 and #2 - Best day time photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu PRO 5 (D) snagged both of those with over 50% of the votes. The LG V10 (C) came second with around 38% of the votes (#1) and 31% (#2). The higher-resolution sensor, 21MP, captured plenty of detail in the well-lit conditions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#3 - Best night time photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 (C) scores a decisive victory here with 74% of the votes. Here the relatively poor low-light performance of the Meizu dropped it to third place. The Huawei Nexus 6P (B) is a distant second with 19%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 comes with the widest aperture of the bunch, f/1.8, and finely tuned software. The Nexus 6P has the biggest pixels on its image sensor, 1.55µm, but poor processing let it down.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#4 - Best day time video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 (C) maintains its lead with 62% of the votes, while the Meizu PRO 5 (D) got a respectable 30%. The other two, Galaxy Note 5 (A) and Nexus 6P (B) scored in the single digits. Note that the PRO 5 has a very narrow field of view, much more so than the others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#5 - Best night time video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Shooting in the dark is LG V10's (C) thing and so is video. This vote got more contentious, but the V10 still won with 41%, while the Meizu PRO 5 (D) took second place with 29%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Nexus 6P (B) almost toppled it though, it was just a single percentage point behind at 28%. The Samsung Galaxy Note5 (A) uses very strong noise reduction, which made the image very soft at it landed it in last place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's it for the blind shootout, expect our full thoughts on the cameras of these four phones tomorrow. The full article will be pit the Nexus 6P, LG V10 and Galaxy Note5 against each other on multiple topics (screen, battery, performance) and the Meizu has a cameo in the camera section.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Blind shootout<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update: Voting is now closed, results are on the first page!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stop us if you've heard this one before - the Samsung Galaxy Note5, LG V10 and Huawei Nexus 6P walk into the GSMArena office... and, of course, we pit them head to head. We'll publish a full vs. article, but first let's see what you think about the cameras of those three phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The marketing for each one of them tells at great length about how the phone combines the best hardware and the best software, but we know better than to trust marketing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, let's see what our contestants have to offer. The Huawei Nexus 6P has the biggest sensor and pixels - 12MP on a 1/2.3" sensor makes for 1.55µm individual pixels. The LG V10 has the widest aperture - f/1.8. Both the V10 and the Samsung Galaxy Note5 have much smaller pixels, 1.12µm. The Note5's aperture is f/1.9, sitting between the V10's and Nexus 6P's f/2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With such impressive hardware, of course we'll a night time photo. But we'll start off with the most common scenario - shooting during the daytime. There raw resolution is more important and the Nexus is at a bit of a disadvantage with 12MP resolution (it has a square-ish 4:3 sensor, the other two shoot widescreen photos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last time around you guys guessed the phones based on just the field of view, which spoiled the fun. This time around, we've downscaled the images and normalized the field of view so it's not going to be so easy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#1 - Best day time photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's the first batch of photos. You'll notice there are four photos - that's because we threw in a mystery phone to serve as a reference. Can you guess which one it is?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vote below, the polls will be open for 24 hours before we close them and reveal the vote counts (and the mystery fourth phone):</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#2 - Best day time photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's another one from the daytime. This one offers a wider view with even more sunlit and shadowy areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And cast another vote below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#3 - Best night time photo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now the promised low-light shots. Note that both the Galaxy Note5 and LG V10 have optical image stabilization, while the Nexus 6P relies only on digital stabilization. OIS can reduce motion blur from shaky hands, while the digital stabilization can't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vote below. You don't have to vote for the same phone on each time, some phones are better during the day than at night.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#4 - Best day time video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also recorded videos, but in the interest of keeping things anonymous here are some screen caps from those videos, plus a side-by-side crop. Again, we resized and cropped the images so that they have identical fields of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Are the three phones as good in video as they are at photos? Vote for your favorite below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#5 - Best night time video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also tried shooting video in the dark. Note that both the images above and these below are taken out of 2160p videos. We also have 1080p samples for the vs. article, perhaps the lower resolution will make things easier for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vote for the best low-light video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again you have 24 hours to cast your votes before we unveil the results. Do you think all four phones did well? Did you hesitate between two equally good ones? After voting you can jump in the comment section to let us know what you think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the reveal, we'll publish a vs. article that covers our thoughts on the camera, but also goes into detail on the screen, battery life, performance and audio quality.</paragraph>
