			<paragraph>The T-Mobile G1 is the Googlephone. Did we really need to say that? Well, there's more Google in this story than there is phone, so we guess we did. We've got a new contender on the race track but we're talking no rookie here. If you thought Apple made the phone game breathtaking, think of where it's all heading with Google keen to play along. Unlike the iPhone Mac OS X, the Android is the joint effort of the whole Open Handset Alliance, which brings together makers that sure know the drill. So much for the rookie, as long as Google is siding with Asus, HTC, LG, Garmin, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Toshiba.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But well, that's the bigger story. We have the first chapter right here, and it's called the T-Mobile G1 or HTC Dream if you prefer. The first impression sure is important. So, there we go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>T-Mobile G1 or to be also released as HTC Dream might not have the specs to make a geek's heart melt but we guess the Android OS was still gonna draw drool even if it came tossed in a plastic bag or wrapped in newspaper. So, forget about the peculiar form factor, the full QWERTY keyboard, the large and crisp touchscreen and the anti-utopian design. Android's inside and google is the limit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>G1 does look like a rather wary and conservative approach to introducing a new OS to the mobile world. While the T-Mobile G1 isn't by any means low-end it kind of deliberately falls short of what the current multimedia monsters have to offer, both in terms of styling and mind-boggling high-tech feats. This gives the G1 two quite important advantages. Firstly the main focus of the device remains on the OS, though this doesn't exactly relieve the pressure. Secondly, keeping a low profile allows the G1 to get away with its juvenile weaknesses more easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another seemingly smart move by Google is to debut in a rather vacant segment where the G1 will face less competition. While there certainly are a few slide-out QWERTY touchscreens, only a couple of them have achieved a fair degree of success recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch Pro and Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 are both manufactured by HTC and are basking in the spotlight. However, the WinMo Professional isn't everyone's cup of tea even with all the custom plug-ins there are. So why not freshen things up by bringing something completely new - the G1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The result they achieved is controversial - the G1 sells pretty decently but still hasn't matched the iPhone kind of hype. Part of the explanation is of course the iPhone itself, which raised the bar rather high for any newcomers. But we doubt that any personal failure of the G1 - if any - is likely to spell doom for the Android platform. So, in a way that sounds pretty safe and reassuring for this here Google-phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we're more interested in that one soldier at this point rather than the army to come. So, let's see if there is more to it, as we inspect the T-Mobile G1 more closely. We take off on the next page with the design and ergonomics of the first of them Androids.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>T-Mobile G1 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 117 x 55.7 x 17.1 mm the T-Mobile G1 is hardly the most pocketable phone you can imagine. It's even a bit bigger than say the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1, which certainly wasn't the most compact handset we have seen. On the other hand, it's a tad slimmer than the HTC Touch Pro so we guess the QWERTY keyboard does take its toll and that's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of the T-Mobile G1 is the formidable 158 grams. Again, that stacks right between the XPERIA X1 and the Touch Pro to give you the first idea of how the phone fares in terms of size and handling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the T-Mobile G1 has rather extraordinary design, not quite like anything else on the market. The tilted chin and the peculiar side sliding mechanism are the most notable design aspects. And by the way that's exactly where the whole design thing came to a complete stop. Whether it's a conscious choice to go low key and not distract the audience from what's inside, the G1 is as simple as it gets. And well, big enough to make sure it won't go unnoticed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the front panel of the phone is taken by the 3.2" 65K-color capacitive touchscreen. Being one of the key ingredients of the package, the display will be discussed in more detail a little later in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the display is the earpiece, while the chin below accommodates five hardware keys and a trackball.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The crowded (in touch phone terms) navigation deck includes call and end keys, home and back buttons and the menu key. Our only grudge with those keys is that they are a bit too small and flush with the surface for our big hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trackball is certainly one of the most comfortable navigation solutions, even if it has its flaws too (in gaming for example). The trackball on the T-Mobile G1 is pretty good thing but just a little short of matching the comfort recent BlackBerry devices offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is that the G1's trackball feels quite small and thus somewhat fails to match the lightning fast response of the BlackBerry Curve 8900 for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the G1 fared a lot better than the Samsung i550 which happens to be the only other trackball device we have tested in the recent months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the T-Mobile G1 are pretty plain with less controls than we are used to. Starting from the right the only element of interest we find is the camera key, which is located just above the bottom edge of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side hosts the volume rocker and the microSD card slot. While we are pretty happy with the volume controls, usability-wise the card slot is one of the worst bits in the phone's construction. It has a small lid over, which can only be lifted up (quite difficult too as the finger rest is really slim) when the slider is open. Furthermore, even when you manage to open it somehow the card is located too deep for a comfortably reach (unless you have inch-long fingernails).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, in our test the T-Mobile G1 card slot handled a 16GB memory card like a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the G1 brings nothing but the battery cover release? or something like that. The fact is, opening the battery cover is a pull-and-pray job where you pull as gently as you can and hope it won't crack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The miniUSB slot is located at the bottom of the T-Mobile G1 hidden under a small plastic lid. The cover takes care of keeping the dirt and grime away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here might just be the place to mention a really peculiar behavior we noticed with the G1. Its touchscreen kept freezing every time we connected it to a computer by anything but its very own miniUSB cable or the one of the HTC Touch Diamond we had lying around. We suspect this has something to do with the proprietary 11-pin miniUSB port by HTC but the really strange thing is the HTC Touch Diamond itself never had such problems with non-proprietary miniUSB cables.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The back side of the handsets is where the 3 megapixel autofocus camera is located, as well as the loudspeaker grill. There is no flash of any kind, suggesting that low-light photography isn't really the G1 element.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover, which gets opened in the aforementioned scary routine, lays the 1150 mAh Li-Ion battery, which powers the G1. Its performance is hardly spectacular managing about a day under heavy usage (an hour and a half of messaging, one hour of browsing over Wi-Fi, several calls and a couple of hours of exploring the rest of the phone features).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the T-Mobile G1 is pretty good, the plastic used looking sleek and durable. The handset would've felt pretty good to hold in hand if it wasn't for the really disturbing rattling noise that comes from the slider spring. Every time you grab or push the G1 a bit harder you hear a squeak.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we appreciate the HTC and Google's attempt to make the device as unique as possible they would've been better off with a regular slider. The single curved spring mechanism also has another disadvantage as the slider has a really uneven run. You basically need to press as hard as you can to get it moving but then you suddenly need to watch your fingers as the top part snaps almost viciously.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The QWERTY Keyboard is good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now this is the one part about the G1 ergonomics over which our team simply couldn't reach an agreement. The problem with the G1's QWERTY keyboard is that its buttons are smaller than average making it hard for most people to get used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand there is more than enough spacing between them so missing by a millimeter or two will not result in a wrong press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all the T-Mobile G1's keyboard does need getting used to but once you do, it gets real quick to type on. And we do mean quick, as the five-row layout has almost ruled out key combinations for the most frequently used symbols.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of the keyboard is also good enough so your typing speed won't suffer in the dark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display reaches for perfection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned, the T-Mobile G1 is equipped with a 3.2" 65K-color capacitive touchscreen of HVGA resolution. The half VGA resolution of 320 x 480 pixels has been recently known as the iPhone resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality is commendable with sharp contrast and good brightness levels on the TFT display. The 65K-color count turns a weakness on very few rare occasions when single color gradients are displayed. In all other aspects the G1 screen performs greatly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is also flawless with the colors retained almost perfectly even when the handset is exposed to direct sunlight. The only thing that makes it worse than the Apple iPhone's display is the fact that it reflects more light, resulting in occasional rainbows on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the touchscreen is also brilliant. A well-known advantage of capacitive touchscreens is their sensitivity, as they don't actually need a push to register a click. Even the lightest of touches does the trick which is probably a large part of the reason why would one buy a touchscreen phone in first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing missing - as a stylus is not an option with capacitive touchscreens - is handwriting recognition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Crash course in Android<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android is a brand new OS, which means it doesn't carry the same kind of baggage as other smartphone platforms. Sure, it uses the Linux kernel but you'll never know it's there - even Google say the OS is not Linux. This means that you'll have to learn a few new things but the interface is very intuitive and consistent so it doesn't take long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things work in a similar way to other OSes but there are differences as well. For example, the "menu" key under the screen doesn't bring up what most people would think of as THE menu. It would be more appropriate to call it a "context menu" as it brings up relevant options to whatever is currently happening on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the case of the homescreen, it brings up a bar with options for modifying its contents - add new shortcuts or widgets, change the wallpaper, launch Search or access Settings. In applications, it brings up buttons that are like soft keys with a "more" tab when the list of available options is too long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get to the actual Main menu you tap the virtual button at the bottom of the screen. This launches a panel with shortcuts to all the applications on the handset. Alternatively, you can drag the panel up with your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping is faster and simpler but, trust us, you'll be dragging it. It has an inherent "cool factor" - pulling it up is almost physical. The interface elements stick to your finger much like on the iPhone - very smooth and very slick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a couple of basic gestures you won't need to learn if you've used a touchscreen phone. The first and most obvious is the simple tap. This is one of the most commonly used gestures - it activates whatever you tapped on, whether a shortcut, a button or a list item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next is the long press, which serves two different purposes. On the homescreen it is used for dragging shortcuts and in lists it is used to bring up a submenu for a specific list item (e.g. if you want to delete a contact).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To remove a shortcut from the homescreen, just drag it to the main menu icon, which will temporarily turn into a trashcan (it works the same way for widgets too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third gesture you need to know to get you going is the sweep. Quite predictably, it scrolls lists up and down or the available homescreens side to side. Multiple desktops have become quite popular, first on computers and now on mobile phones as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android homescreen has three separate desktops that actually seem like three parts of one single panoramic desktop. Eye candy is of course not forgotten - the default background is a stunning landscape (there are several wallpapers preinstalled) and the icons move a little faster than the background adding a feeling of depth and added dimension that's not to be seen on any other OS - somehow the icons look closer to you that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the keyboard out switches the screen to landscape but despite the change in aspect ratio, the arrangement of the icons doesn't change. That is, an icon's relative position remains the same.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Things to look out for<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android has some peculiarities. It doesn't recognize the concept of "running" and "closed" applications. Instead it gives the impression that all apps are running all the time. The system may close an app that runs in the background to preserve resources but as soon as the user selects it again Android will restore it to its previous state so that the user never knows the app had actually been closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pleasant surprise is that all this background activity doesn't lead to any hang-ups or slowdowns. Holding down the Home key brings up a kind of "task switcher". It's not really a task switcher, though, as some of the applications you've already started may no longer appear running for the reasons described above. Still, the task switcher is useful as it gives you access to the six most recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android doesn't have the typical concept of a "file system" either. You can put folders on the homescreen to help keep things organized but you can't put folders within folders. Browsing through your memory card is out of the question too. Instead, your only chance of checking what's on it is by using the respective file viewers - to check photos on the memory card open up the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes sense - a music player would do a much better job of navigating your music collection than a generic file browser. This however has its drawback as, say, copying a file from the memory card to the internal memory is not possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here the app store - the Android Market - comes into play offering a wide range of applications (most of them free) to do what you need. But more on that later in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some "bad" habits you need to break when using Android. For example the red receiver key doesn't bring you to the homescreen as it does on every other phone out there, instead it locks the keyboard (and screen). Another one is that typing just about anything short of a phone number requires you to open the keyboard, at least until the expected Cupcake goodness spills over the G1. The only virtual onscreen keyboard the G1 has out of the box is a basic dialer to quickly punch in a phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However it's interesting to know that some of the applications that come fresh out of the Android Market have their own onscreen QWERTY keyboards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing that we found missing in this new Android line of work, is a nice and easily accessible Wireless manager - having some type of a shortcut pad for managing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the likes directly from the homescreen would have been a nice asset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Secret handshake - the gesture unlock<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A quite intriguing feature is the Gesture lock. Yes, the Apple iPhone came up with the whole "slide to unlock" thing but with Samsung I7500 the unlock slide can take a very complex shape. The phone can be set to require a preset pattern of onscreen sweeps each time you're unlocking it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way it works is you're presented with a 3 x 3 grid of dots and you have to connect at least four dots in whatever order you choose. Now, we'd advise against too complex shapes, as you have to draw the shape again if you want to cancel or change it, so forgetting it would be quite unfortunate. You can choose to have haptics enabled so with a little training you can unlock the phone without looking at the grid. There's even an option that disables the trail that connects the dots completing the pattern.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Buttons and dials<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are quite a few things you can add to the homescreen. Shortcuts, folders and bookmarks are the most basic ones but you can also add shortcuts to contacts, Gmail labels and even playlists. There is also widget support but you get just three widgets at this point: clock, search and picture frame. You can't download new ones from the Market just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search button on the hardware keypad (the one with the magnifying glass on) activates context relevant search - in the homescreen it's Google search, in the Gmail app it searches the mail, when browsing contacts it quite naturally searches for contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only place where it doesn't do what you'd expect it to is in the browser - it doesn't search on the page but instead brings up Google search again. The other gripe we have is that it doesn't search for items on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search button also moonlights as a quick launch button. For example, Search + B launches the browser, Search + C brings up the contacts and so on. You can also assign your own shortcuts in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, there are shortcuts using other keyboard combinations. A number of Menu key + letter button combinations work as shortcuts for apps, while Menu + W in the browser closes a tab just like in computer browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Android is the notification area. As usual, there's a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you slide it down you get a list of all recent notifications - that's the so called notifications area. Tapping one of the listed notifications takes a context relevant action - for instance, a tap on a notification of a successful installation would launch that application; a finished download notification will open the file and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since you can open the notification area from wherever the top bar is visible, new events won't interrupt your work. You can slide the tray down like a window blind just enough to see more details about what has happened and if it's not important you can let it slide back up and continue where you left off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can store quite a lot of information. It lets you input numbers for work and home, and you can even create custom labels. There is of course an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something of special interest is the option to send calls directly to voicemail. You can also add IM nickname info to the contact as well as a postal address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in the Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a photo to a contact is quite easy: when you select a photo, a cropping tool comes up allowing you to use any photo you want. Adding a photo has a pleasant "side effect" - if you put a dialing shortcut for the contact on the screen, it uses the photo as an icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact the various details display in sections. There is a Dial number and a Send SMS/MMS tab with the numbers for the contacts listed. Each number fills an entire horizontal row so it's easy to hit with your thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email also has a tab that works just like the ones for numbers. The rest of the information (if any) is displayed under that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Audio quality during a call is perfect and reception is quite good despite the signal strength bar underestimating the signal strength a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To dial a number without looking up your contacts you use the Dialer - a virtual onscreen numpad. The hardware QWERTY keyboard gets much involved in telephony too. Hitting a number key on the hardware keyboard in standby mode will bring up the dialer while hitting a letter key brings up the contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Android the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. In the phonebook you can search for contacts by gradually typing out a name but this doesn't work in the dialer. Searching by typing the number doesn't work either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker independent voice dialing is on board but unfortunately it doesn't work over a Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging the Google way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the strengths of the T-Mobile G1 is its messaging department. It has all one can dream of, except for the ability to set up MS Exchange mail; however, it should be just a matter of time before the developers fix that flaw.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The T-Mobile G1 can handle all common types of messages - SMS, MMS and email. Instant messaging is quite well-heeled with AIM, Google Talk, Windows live messenger and Yahoo! Messenger all at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go into details, we'd like to go back to the interesting way that incoming messages are handled. You will see no notifications on the homescreen but rather a tiny SMS icon on the status bar at the top. When you tap this bar and drag it down you will see the network provider and all the incoming notifications such as incoming mails, calls, messages, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have only one SMS message, it displays the sender and part of the text. If you have two or more messages are, you are simply informed of the number and the SMS section is opened once you hit the icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple at first glance - there are no folders here, just a new message tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messages are organized into threads, the newest message placed at the bottom, just like the Apple iPhone 3G. There are no bubbles here but the latest message in the chat history is colored in light blue. At the bottom of the display is the type-to-compose box and the send key of course. There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 16 or fewer characters left out of the limit of 160.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing the corresponding name and choose from the numbers offered. The drawback here is that the bar displays the desired number rather than the contact name. This is especially frustrating when you send a message to multiple recipients since you have to remember which people are already listed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you get a new message, the whole messaging history with that person is pushed to the top of the messaging menu, no matter when your last conversation with that person was. When you open it, you can see the latest message displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If any of the chat histories contain drafts or unsent messages, corresponding icons and text notify you of that. A really great thing is that each chat can hold a draft/unsent text in the type-to-compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contextual menu key adds more usability and friendliness to the process. If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, just mark it with the trackball and press menu for general settings and options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you can press and hold the trackball itself to bring up features such as edit, forward, delete message, as well as view details and call number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you apply the same trick with the trackball when you are in the type-to-compose area you gets access to functions such as cut, copy and paste text. You are free to paste the copied text to any text editing area like email, note, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have a vast collection of messages and you are a typing expert, it is always good to know how many of your numerous messages are still undelivered. In the main messaging menu, there is the "undelivered messages" key, which displays only undelivered messages but not the entire chat history. Once you are there, you can either send them one by one, send all or delete the ones you don't need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically converted into MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Email, Gmail and IM<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the style of Apple, your precious brand new G1 is almost unusable unless you activate it. In this case, it's done by punching in your Google account credentials. You are required to have a valid Gmail username and account to unlock the full functionality of the phone. You are also forced to sync your contacts via Gmail, which obviously is ? well ? the Google way or the highway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you already have a Gmail account, you can immediately access the full web-based service via the Gmail app on the T-Mobile G1. Basically, you're getting a copy of Gmail right there on your phone. The labels are there too and you can define which of them to sync. You can also apply ringtones and vibration for an incoming message, favorite messages, report as spam, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned, there is a standard email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. Sadly the emails are not display threaded like the the Gmail app, but you still have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, the folders are organized in a tree structure - one click over a specific folder reveals its contents and the second click closes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the other standard email features and options are here too, but this doesn't come as a surprise as even most non-smartphones have fairly developed email clients preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The T-Mobile G1 has four chat clients preinstalled - AIM, Google Talk, Windows Live and Yahoo! Messenger. Skype and ICQ ? two of the most popular instant messenger apps got their Android versions too, even though they are not official.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Skype will deliver a ?lite? version with core functionality for many Java-enabled and Android-based devices soon. Meanwhile, ICQ has several unofficial versions available and the final choice is up to you. These applications can run on background too, but we are uncertain whether they get automatically terminated when the phone needs more memory for other processes, which is the default logic behind the OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia: image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T-Mobile G1 has a decent multimedia department, but that's all. One of our big disappointments is that the G1 doesn't have a preinstalled video player, which is now considered a basic feature on most mobile phones - users obviously have to pay the price for enjoying the Andorid OS at an early level of development.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G1 gallery is a standard one, while the music player has a high level of both performance and usability. It's a pity that the audio quality is not as good as we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's have a look at the picture gallery, a standard application on any phone. We've seen all kinds of galleries with lots of features and functions: the gallery on Nokia's N series offers superb usability and handling; Sony Ericsson and Samsung also rate highly while LG offer fluid touch experience. Unfortunately, the G1 gallery ranks somewhere just below Sony Ericsson and Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery automatically looks for images, no matter where they are stored. If they are separated in different folders, images will appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the relevant folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the name is a number indicating how many images are in that folder. Each sub-gallery has a thumbnail, which displays either the latest image (if the folder contains less than four images) or four thumbs if there are at least four files in this folder. There is no way to change these view options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first All Pictures gallery holds the entire image collection, starting with the latest images at the top. From here, the contextual menu allows you to start a slideshow or to access the settings. Unfortunately, autorotation of images does not work and you have to manually change the orientation in the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on a gallery thumb opens a menu which allows you to start a slideshow or view the gallery. In the same manner, holding your thumb on a specific image starts the options menu with features such as view, share, rotate, delete, crop or set as.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, there is no option for single or multiple marking of images for mass cut/copy/delete. Another disappointment is that scrolling thumbs of images up and down is quite choppy, too. Caching images takes quite a while when you open a gallery for the first time. However, once that's done, they are loaded almost instantaneously even if a folder contains thousands of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Full size images load immediately. Zooming in on an image can be very irritating since it's is done in quite small increments and while you can zoom in beyond the actual image resolution, there is no quick and easy return to normal view. At least there is a quick zoom mode, which is activated when you press the zoom in/out for a second and then all you have is to keep your finger on the zoom key until you reach the desired level of magnification.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mutimedia: music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T-Mobile G1 has a very comfortable and capable music player. The player supports the main file formats, such as MP3, WAV, WMA, and AAC and is among the exceptions that can be set to run in the background. One of its major drawbacks is the lack of equalizer presets or other features like stereo widening, enhanced bass or visualizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another let down concerning music is there is no standard 3.5mm audio jack on the G1 and they didn't even provide a miniUSB to 3.5mm adapter in the retail package. Don't worry though, as you can easily snatch one online for several bucks. As the G1 is manufactured by HTC all miniUSB adapters made for HTC will do here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main display has four big icons for artists, albums, songs, and playlists. At the very bottom of the screen is the now playing section with the author and the track name. The play icon is not active, i.e. it does not start or pause the track but serves as a shortcut to the track itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The artists section lists the performers in the library. Indication of the number of albums and tracks are right under the artist's name. The specific tree structure allows you to see the different albums and the tracks in them and album art is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you select a track it starts playing immediately. On the right side of the album label there are shortcuts for now playing list, shuffle and repeat. Each time you press a key a small tooltip gets displayed over the play key to indicate what action has been taken. On top of this there are the contextual menus where you get additional access and features such as library, add to playlists, use as a ringtone, delete, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums, Songs and Playlist icons in the main player menu are also at hand if you prefer them for quicker access to your music files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the gradual-typing search option is for people who don't remember the whole name of the track or simply want to quickly get to it. The good news is that it works with any part of the song's name.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T-Mobile G1 achieved about average scores on most readings in our traditional audio quality test. The handset has tolerable audio output which considering the high price tag is hardly a great achivement. It has cut-off bass frequencies, probably due to some kind of high-pass filter meant to improve sound on small size headphones. The distortion levels are passable but not great by any means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the T-Mobile G1 has good dynamic range, noise level and low stereo crosstalk. A comparison to the Apple iPhone is by no means favorable to the G1 but most WinMo devices like the HTC Touch Pro in our chart are not too far ahead. And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Where is the video player?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The G1 is said to run one of the most advanced OSes around, and yet it doesn't have any video player preinstalled. Having in mind it's the first device with the new OS, and since there are already some free video players that can be downloaded off the Android Market, we will pass that with a smile. We really hope the next device powered by Andorid will have that fixed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were somewhat surprised to find out that there is a sneaky way to play 3gp clips without any installed player. What you need is email a 3gp video to your Gmail account and then open it by using the "Preview" option in your email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as we could tell, the G1 only supports the H.263 codec. This means that you will be able to play 3GP and MPEG4 clips that are encoded with the codec, but nothing else. We are not quite sure how this will turn out, but we really hope developers will find a way to extend the video support a little further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a third-party video player by by Jeff Hamilton we downloaded additionaly. It supports auto rotate, has a simple but efficient user interface and is quite stable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 3 megapixel camera snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To be honest we expected a pretty mediocre snapper with limited capabilities on the T-Mobile G1. We've never seen a nice camera by HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet the G1 delivers decent quality 3MP action on a phone although it cannot compete with the best 3MP sensors in Sony Ericsson and Nokia handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But a picture is worth a thousand words, so here come several camera samples taken with the G1:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see for yourself the G1 camera produces an acceptable level of detail without generating too much noise. Except for a few white balance misses, we are actually quite pleased with the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no over sharpening or purple fringing although the dynamic range of the sensor seems somewhat worse than we are used to seeing on 3 MP cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is quite clean. By default the viewfinder is free of any overlay controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu button brings up only two options - save/delete and enabling geo-tagging. There is no setting for resolution - so it is practically unchangeable. Apple iPhone anyone?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is macro mode up to 2cm (which is excellent too), but it's completely automatic. All this simplicity might not please some users who are dying to mess with the camera settings, but most people will probably appreciate the ease of use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A little bug we found with the camera is that if you start it by pressing the camera key, continuing to keep the key pressed after the camera has been activated, starts a second instance of the camera interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, with good conscience we can say that the camera is good?or at least pretty decent. But, there is always something waiting in the wings to spoil the party and that's the absence of video recording. Again - just like on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, don't get upset just yet - video capturing is planned to hit Android OS along with a load of other improvements some time in April with the rumored Cupcake update.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you may suspect, the Android browser is fast and the interface clean. But unlike so many of its smartphone siblings, Flash support is not available. The T-Mobile G1 web browser is based on the same open source WebKit used in Chrome and Safari, and this accounts for the smooth user experience. Pages load quickly, and navigating with fingers is just as easy as on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite having a capacitive touch-screen like the iPhone, the G1 does not support multi-touch unless tweaked. This means that right out of the box zooming is not the browser's strong point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to some other applications (like Google Maps), you can zoom by touching the two virtual plus and minus buttons at the bottom of the screen, and there is also a dedicated on-screen key to zoom out and view the whole web page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android team also added a rather nifty function to help you read when in maximum zoom-out mode. This is a small rectangle which acts like a magnifier and enables you to read small portions of the microscopic web page. You can move it with your finger and sometimes it can be quite useful. But in the end, this is just another zoom option since the moment you release your finger, the magnifier disappears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the option to have multiple web pages open at the same time. If you hit the Windows button in the browser menu, you will see all the currently opened pages and you can choose which one of them to view. Switching from one page to another involves smooth transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser handled perfectly most of the pages we threw at it and we are very satisfied with the results. The capacitive screen coupled with the browser's performance makes surfing on the G1 a real treat and maybe the only thing missing is multi-touch. But then again, that's been addressed by a relevant tweak, so we guess the only grudge is the missing Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A YouTube application is onboard and is almost the same as the iPhone version, the only difference being the addition of a category view on the G1. Watching mobile video is easy and despite some occasional quality issues, it does the job. Unfortunately, unlike most other Google stuff on the G1, your YouTube account is not synced with your online profile. That means you cannot exchange favorites or check your channel subscriptions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity quite diversified<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The G1 offers excellent HSDPA 7.2Mpbs, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.0. The handset features quad-band GSM and tri-band HSDPA support, as well as USB 2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accessing the connectivity options can be done in two ways - you can either open the Main Menu and look up Wireless controls under Settings, or you can push the hardware menu button on the home screen and select Settings in the contextual menu. The second option is better when you have a long list of applications crowding the main menu and you don't want to scroll all the way down to get to the Settings icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the really few things missing in this new Android business is a nice and easily accessible Wireless manager - having some type of a shortcut pad for managing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the likes directly from the homescreen would have been a nice asset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi support is excellent. It's very easy to get running, with no need to dig through the menus or set various parameters. Just click on the desired network, type a password if needed and there you go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth isn't quite as good. Just like the iPhone, it's for headset use only and does not support file transfer or A2DP. Maybe these will be enabled at some point in the future, but at the moment they are sorely missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity menu is Network - you can enable or disable 2G networks depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As much as we are surprised there is no desktop sync application, synchronizing your data couldn't be easier - it's just that you sync with the Google cloud of webservers instead to your desktop rig.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no USB Mass storage support or USB internet sharing (the so-called tethering). The T-Mobile G1 charges off the USB cable but that's as far as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could do some USB tethering, but it requires a bit of hacking and unapproved third-party software. More on that in the Tweaks&amp;Modding section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: While at first we really concluded that the T-Mobile G1 doesn't have USB Mass Storage mode, some of our users actually reported we were wrong. One of the requirements for this to work is to only use the original USB cable supplied with G1 (or any other proprietary USB cable by HTC). No other standard miniUSB cable will do the job though it would still charge the thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've connected the handset via the original cable, you should check your notifications area by sliding it down. You will find a USB connection notification there, allowing you to perform the additional task of mount your phone via USB. It's only then that your G1 will appear as a removable drive on your computer. Bear in mind that it will only mount the memory card slot, not the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When reviewing an entirely new OS, a failure to spot that USB notification is quite understandable even for an experienced team such as ours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It however says a lot about the usability of the software interface. Perhaps Google would benefit from a new notifications alert logic making those little alerts such as the USB connection a bit more conspicuous. This is true for every other notification - such as the incoming SMS alert - the event alerts are just not as obvious one might expect.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks and modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Usually a high user interest into a mobile platform is guaranteed to bring about a host of tweaks and modding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first and most obvious opportunity for developers is the presence of a capacitive touchscreen that lacks multi-touch support. The reason why Google didn't implement multi-touch is still unclear, but rumors point to Apple as the main obstacle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, whether it's coming officially or not is hardly the big question here, but rather when the eager Android fan coders will create a hack for it. The process has started and the first results were seen a month ago, available for anyone to try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will find the required files and instructions to open up your G1 to multi-touch here. The mod adds active multi-touch support for the G1's web browser and showcases how would multi-touch feel in Google Maps and the image gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried this multi-touch addition for the web browser and it worked perfectly fine. The experience is quite iPhone-like and works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting mod is the DroidSans Tweak Tools. It gives you the option to turn on the auto screen rotation, which lacks by default. There are some limitations of course, mostly with unsupported apps such as the web browser or unsupported software. More information is available at the link above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another disappointment was the missing virtual QWERTY keyboard. It is available in some third-party applications. Soon all Android owners should be able to get the official on-screen keyboard in the massive Cupcake update in April.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upcoming Cupcake update will add video recording too. Video recording is something that the iPhone still lacks - even after two major OS revisions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In December Google released a SIM-unlocked developer version of the T-Mobile G1 with unlocked boot loader. Today the dev tools can be found all over the web providing you with the ability to flash your device with different and modified firmwares, that come with some relatively useful apps for system monitoring and etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned internet tethering via USB is not available by default on the G1. The Tetherbot app is what you need for connecting your laptop to the internet using EDGE, 3G or whatever else your T-Mobile G1 is using. Here you can find the download package, detailed installation instructions and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The obvious Bluetooth features absence will be fixed too with the upcoming update adding a Stereo Bluetooth support. If there will be more is still unclear at this stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of other small apps tweaking many aspects of the OS, but none of them are quite as interesting as the ones we mentioned above so we won't cover them here. When Cupcake is released, be sure we will take a closer look at it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T-Mobile G1 is a full-blooded smartphone but surprisingly doesn't sport a document viewer - a must for a device in this class (not to mention the price range).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, mail attachments such as office documents and PDF files are displayed but you can't download them and files saved on the memory card or in the phone's inbuilt memory can't be viewed either. Luckily, news of upcoming (paid) document viewers is circulating on the web, so we won't have too long to wait to see one working on a T-Mobile G1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having said all that, we can proceed happily as all the other elements of the organizer are ship shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the calendar, for instance. It has five different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly, monthly and today. Adding a new event is easy and quick, and you can also set an alarm to remind you about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard and you can use it with either on the touchscreen or with the hardware keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't find a preloaded voice recorder but it took us less than a minute to download a free and functional one at the Android Market. It even gives you the option to send the voice message right after it's been recorded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, The T-Mobile G1 features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The GPS receiver needed a few minutes upon the first start-up to locate the satellites available, but after that it worked just fine. And, of course, it comes as no surprise that the only application you can rely on for navigation right out of the box is Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is slightly different from what we've seen before. Quick double-tapping can't be used for zooming in and out; instead, this now happens through the two buttons at the bottom of the screen. These are hidden when not in use and appear when you touch the screen. But despite these small cosmetic changes, this is still the familiar Google Maps app we know and like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the built-in accelerometer doesn't automatically kick in when using Google Maps and the only way to make the T-Mobile G1 show you the maps in landscape mode is to slide the screen up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accelerometer works in the Street View mode only. This mode by the way is the most interesting part about the Google Maps on T-Mobile G1. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in you can open a 360-degree photographic view of the area. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice guided navigation and turn-by-turn navigation aren't possible using Google Maps. Still, there is some kind of navigation: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your goal sometimes? assuming you can read maps of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, there is a free app that allows turn-by-turn voice guided navigation using the T-Mobile G1 and it's called AndNav! (there's AndNav!2 as well). The latter uses Google Maps, again, but adds some extra features that justify the download. AndNav! uses the inbuilt digital compass and you no longer have to turn the handset to orientate the map to match your direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As mentioned, the AndNav! app offers turn-by-turn navigation, which isn't bad at all. The voice guided navigation, though, is questionable - to use it you need an extra, free app (Text-To-Speech Library) which supports English along with many other languages. Using text-to-speech engines instead of pre-recorded voices is bound to give you a horrific computerized voice output but still the app is helpful.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Welcome to the Android Market!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T-Mobile G1 comes with almost no preinstalled applications (unless we count Google Maps, the Amazon MP3 app or the YouTube client) but the Android Market is open for business and offers multiple apps (with a lot of free ones, as well) which can be downloaded directly from the handset using Wi-Fi or the mobile network (3G for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch is the warning shown if the application you're about to download has potentially unsafe access to personal data, connectivity settings or else. The warning says exactly what this application will access so you can abort the download if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When an app is being downloaded a status bar appears at the top of the display to track progress. When download is complete, you can start the application from the same button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market follows the logic of the pioneering Apple App Store. Everything about it - the structure, the look - is eerily familiar. Although it doesn't look quite that good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's as easy as pie to find and download the app you need?.assuming of course the app you need is available! Having said that, the number of apps will grow over time and the selection will just get bigger and hopefully, better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from incredibly useless (such as the one that turns the display into a huge flashlight) to true must-have's (including file managers and video players).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, there are also games ... lots of them. That's quite nice, as the G1 doesn't have any games pre-loaded much like the iPhone didn't have any back in the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the Amazon MP3 application is concerned, it seems as Google's attempt at competing the iTunes store - it offers a wide choice of tracks. Interestingly however most are DRM-free, but we guess that's included in the price.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There we are at the end of our very first Android-powered review. The T-Mobile G1 made quite a start and had us impressed on quite a few counts. It's far from the perfect package but it gets the things that mater done and gets them done right. The interface is not only up and running, it has purpose and direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It maybe a long journey but the first step is daring enough. Instead of trying to expand on an already existing platform Google decided to build a new one from scratch and the effort is well worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The immaturity of the platform has its disadvantages too - the limited third party software and the lack of hardware choices. Those are being addressed as we speak of course and the Android Market will be brimming with software sooner rather than later, while new Android devices should be just around the corner set to launch in 2009.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But back to the small story in the Android history, T-Mobile G1 or its sibling HTC Dream is already standing taller than its actual height. What would've been another average smart QWERTY messenger is the herald of Google OS. Of course, the lack of Flash support in the browser, Bluetooth file transfer or even a proper file manager will be used against the G1 but it's not what it would be remembered by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to the iPhone, it doesn't necessarily need to feel threatened at this point, but at least Apple will know that changing the rules on the mobile phone market is not their exclusive territory.</paragraph>
