			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now that the dust of the Diamond vs. Omnia PocketPC battle settles down, our up close and personal look at the rivals continues with Samsung i900 Omnia. Slick looks, great feature-pack and ingenious software solutions are things that hold true for the i900 Omnia in the same extent as for the Diamond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And since the Samsung i900 Omnia boasts loads of character and personality it's no wonder it holds the crowd hooked ever since it was announced. The first five megapixel Windows Mobile cameraphone has inspired quite a following and now that it's already market available in Europe we are more than happy to welcome the Omnia back after a well deserved breather. Well then, we've seen it race, let's watch it cruise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PocketPC mid-season may as well be a hush before the storm with the HTC Touch Pro and Xperia waiting to be unleashed. But for now we have two other bitter rivals to keep us busy: Samsung i900 Omnia and HTC Touch Diamond. It truly is a great achievement for Samsung to have a gadget fit to stand up to the top PocketPC manufacturer HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two devices are doing a great job standing their ground to the Apple iPhone 3G and it's no wonder since each of them is technically more advanced than Apple's creation. In fact, they have a lot of things in common with the iPhone - the full Touch UI, the nice multimedia capabilities and the superior web browsing experience. But we digress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already saw the Diamond and Omnia in action and you're free to replay the game here. The Diamond surely has a few things to offer over the Omnia (VGA screen, smaller size, 3D acceleration, and magnetic stylus) but it also has its issues here and there to make it a tough call indeed. We do hope however that this review will bring you a little closer to deciding your allegiance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of you that have already gone through the Diamond vs Omnia article might be probably wondering if this review is worth your time. Well, truthfully, we have put our every effort to make it worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, since we finished the grand battle between these two high-end handsets, we received a final retail unit of the Samsung Omnia, which proved much better both in performance and software equipment. We've taken care to reflect all those changes in this review. And there's even more:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if we've got you interested enough, take the jump to the hardware inspection of Samsung i900 Omnia.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Samsung i900 Omnia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i900 Omnia comes in nicely looking medium-sized package. Its contents cover all the basics. A DC charger, a CD with the required software for PC synchronization and a bunch of manuals go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stylus dongle is also included and it's almost identical to the LG Viewty's in design. And much like with the Viewty, it's meant to dangle on its string tied to the lanyard eyelet. This isn't handy at all, so our guess is most Omnia users will give it up in the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handsfree, which consists of two parts - a remote and a set of headphones. The remote sports a standard 3.5mm jack, which means that you can change the provided headset with any other set you have at hand. Finally, there is a number of ear buds of varying sizes for a comfortable fit of the nicely designed headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i900 Omnia 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Standing at 112 x 56.9 x 12.5 mm, Samsung i900 Omnia is on the hefty side. This is of course mainly in terms of width and height, as the 12.5 mm thickness does sound great to us. In all fairness, it cannot compare to the compact HTC Touch Diamond but the Omnia is still easily pocketable. The weight of 127 grams isn't much of a feat for a no-keypad device but we guess it's the price to pay for all the top-notch features on board.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Designwise, the Samsung i900 Omnia doesn't differ that much from most other touchscreen handsets. In fact, there isn't much room for designer creativity in this class of devices, so the Omnia is understandably similar to its market rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, we do like the finish of the rear, which might not be as unique as the HTC Touch Diamond but looks really classy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the front panel of the Samsung i900 Omnia we find the earpiece, the ambient light sensor and the secondary video-call camera. Almost all the rest is the 3.2" touchscreen, which we'll come back to a little later in our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very bottom of the front are the Call and End keys, with the optical joystick amidst. The optical joystick is a nice little control, which is used for thumbing around a virtual mouse cursor in a way identical to Samsung i780.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Samsung i900 Omnia sports the lanyard eyelet and the Samsung proprietary USB port. Frankly, we would have preferred the miniUSB variety. Boy, even microUSB could've done better, giving the Omnia much greater compatibility. After all, miniUSB cables are extremely popular and microUSB is also quickly catching up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the Omnia we come upon the volume rocker and the dedicated camera key. They are both positioned in the lower half of the handset and are large and comfortable enough to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Near the top of the right side we find the knob that launches the thumb-optimized Main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All there is at the bottom of Samsung i900 Omnia is the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the power key and the reset hole. The kinda small and recessed power key did get on our nerves every once in a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i900 Omnia rear hosts the 5 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash that's supposed to boost performance in the dark. There is a preinstalled application that lets you use the flash as a torch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: The back panel of the Omnia is all plastic despite looking as if it has a brushed metal finish. You can't really tell that just by looking at it, but once you touch it, it feels like plain plastic alright. Nevertheless, we are really fond of this design solution - it certainly adds to the Omnia looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 1440-mAh Li-ion battery that powers the Omnia. The generous capacity, combined with the good power-management capabilities of the Marvel CPU, give the Omnia great battery life. The manufacturer quotes it at up to 500h of standby time and up to almost 6h in talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under our care and some moderate usage the Omnia lasted 60 hours with a single charge. The moderate usage in question is something like a total of 20 minutes of talk time, 1 hour of in-car GPS navigation, 1 hour of web browsing via Wi-Fi or 3G, and taking around 40 camera photos. The GPS receiver is a real battery drainer, so if you don't use it the device should last even longer. And we won't be surprised, if it lasts a week under really low usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing we found under the battery cover is the memory card slot. Hot swap was nowhere in sight as you have to remove the battery to access it. After all with 8 (up to 16) GB of onboard storage, the main purpose of the card slot is to serve as an extra connectivity option. Still, no hot swap is a loss we just can't get over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, we are really pleased with the construction quality of the Samsung i900 Omnia. It looks sturdy and feels nice in hand, the hefty size aside. We heard no creaks or other disturbing sounds for the time of our review and we also didn't notice any signs of wear and tear although we used it rather heavily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controversial Wide QVGA Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i900 Omnia is equipped with a large 3.2" 65K-color display with a resolution of 240 x 400 pixels. As with most PocketPCs, picture quality isn't really impressive. Not that it is too bad either but we've seen Samsung do much better on their feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display resolution can also be considered somewhat of a problem at times. Wide QVGA might be great for watching widescreen movies, web browsing and viewing photos but it does bring up some compatibility issues. For example, we had quite a hard time starting the iGO 2008 navigation software on the Omnia. We guess similar issues will arise with other applications too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of sunlight legibility, Samsung i900 Omnia is also far from its prime. It's really hard to see anything on the display outdoors on a sunny day, and finding a proper angle for working with the phone is near impossible. This has a particularly negative effect on photography, as you can hardly see the viewfinder at times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Single-handed operation with a mouse<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung engineers have staked so much on touchability that they didn't bother put a stylus slot on the Omnia's body. The retail package includes one, but there's no place for it in the handset itself. Instead you can leave it on hanging as a dongle from the handset body. We hate saying that (as much as we don't like using a stylus), but the hard work Samsung have put into making it more touch-friendly unfortunately doesn't rule out the stylus as a means of input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i900 Omnia doesn't have many hardware buttons - a main Menu key and a camera key on the right, Call and End keys and the optical joystick basically complete the list. The MainMenu key on the right hand side of the handset activates the proprietary Main menu, which is quite touch-optimized. A longer press on that key will open the Task Manager no matter where you are in the interface (neat indeed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, the Omnia offers a unique small touchpad that operates in two modes - it's either a regular touchpad or you can use it to navigate an on-screen mouse pointer. In both cases however the touchpad doubles as a hardware button that you can press for confirming, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In touchpad mode (the one without mouse pointer) a quick sweep produces a single move of the current selection (i.e. only jumping to the closest item). However an improvement with the retail Omnia we received has added a new functionality. Now a slower sweep over the touchpad moves the selection by four items instead of only one. That way it can conveniently be used for scrolling for example in menus such as Programs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouse pointer mode is interesting too and can substitute the stylus at most times allowing for single-handed usage. You can scroll easily with the mouse by holding the pointer dead center on a side scrollbar and pressing longer. This activates the scrolling mode and a single sweep takes you up and down. A single press deactivates the scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside of the mouse pointer mode is that you can't use it to drag-to-select or to invoke a context menu by a longer press on the joystick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Navigating around the user interface on the Samsung Omnia is further enhanced by the screen auto rotation thanks to the built-in accelerometer. There is even a nice little animation to make the transition of the screens more visually appealing. You can also disable that feature if you see the need to do so. The sensor sensitivity is also adjustable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia also offers nice touch feedback when you touch the screen. The Omnia vibrates shortly to confirm every key press. Unfortunately, the haptic feedback doesn't always mean your key press was actually accepted and the command is being run.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Omnia is a nice all-rounder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i900 Omnia CPU is clocked at 624Mhz and it indeed pays off. The Omnia fares superbly against most of our software benchmarks and the system response is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the most pitched feature of the i900 Omnia is its touch-optimized interface. And indeed we welcomed most of the changes and custom solutions introduced by Samsung. Although this is their first attempt at custom Windows Mobile interfaces, they have a lot of experience with full Touch UI handsets, which was obviously put to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the thumbable interface, the Omnia offers massive embedded storage clearly stating its multimedia orientation. The iPhone was among the first devices to pack 4GB, 8GB and 16GB of onboard memory in a similar fashion to the popular Apple iPods. Windows Mobile devices are now obviously taking up and the Samsung i900 Omnia has two versions - one with 8GB, and another with 16GB worth of storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there's the 5 megapixel camera that offers fast response, excellent image quality and a bunch of high-end cameraphone features. The Omnia is the first 5 megapixel PocketPC to hit the market and it totally stands up to the challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the built-in GPS receiver allows the i900 Omnia to make a nice in-car/walk-around GPS navigation unit, provided you install some software for the purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So overall, with the Samsung i900 Omnia we are looking at a really nice package - full of goodies for both the high-tech and the style-conscious customers but we are yet to see how it delivers on all those fronts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It's a clear case of Widgetry<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well OK, don't go running for a dictionary. Just know that widgetry is no crime, never mind the punch line up there. We totally made it up to spice this headline just like Samsung implanted the TouchWiz to tweak up the WinMo UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung are playing it smart with a proven performer of a plug-in to their spanking new WinMo handset. The concept of widgets on your home screen is nothing new - we've already seen it implemented on the Samsung F480 Tocco. But they have done a great job porting it to Windows Mobile Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making a step further, Samsung offer not one, not two, but a good three different touch optimized Home screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First is the Widgets home screen. It's basically a blank screen you can fill up with a number of mini applications of your choosing. There's a sidebar full of those widgets and they are simply begging to be taken out for a spin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets can be dragged onto the unpopulated screen and moved around to your liking. If any is to be stashed away, all you need to do is drag it back to the sidebar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the available Widgets are a digital clock, an analog clock, a world-time clock, a birthday reminder list, a photo browser, ringing profile selector, a music player, an FM radio, a Notes widget, and a calendar, plus several shortcuts to Windows applications such as Notes, Games, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an impressive list but they are not that practical and when you get bored you can switch to the more pragmatic tabbed Home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first tab of this alternative Home screen shows an ample clock and the date, plus shortcuts to SMS, Email inbox and the Calls log. The second tab allows quick access to favorite contacts and the third tab is a quick fix for frequently used settings such as: changing ringing profiles, screen auto rotation, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, mouse, LED flashlight and USB mode. You switch between tabs with a simple finger sweep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alongside those two Home screens, there is also the MainMenu, which acts as some sort of an application launcher. The MainMenu is a lot like a regular feature phone menu and gives access to Samsung's very own calls log, phonebook, music player, camera, FM radio, media library, image gallery, and installed applications. You also have access to Windows Mobile messaging and settings, as well as a grid of shortcuts to frequently used applications (this one is customizable unlike the MainMenu itself).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's very own in the paragraph above means that Samsung have added custom applications (such as the Phonebook or Calls Log), that are much more thumbable than their Windows counterparts. In fact, they remind a lot the Apple iPhone interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the third available Home screen is a mix between the tabbed Home screen and the Main menu. Well, it's not tabbed but looks a lot like the tabbed variety. But instead of shortcuts to some settings, it offers an application launcher similar to the Main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the first two home screens the right-hand hardware key starts the proprietary Main Menu but since you have that already on display with the third Home screen, the key starts the Shortcuts, which are otherwise part of the menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A step further takes you down to Windows Mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once you get past the Home screen and all the finger sweeps, all you are left with is the good old Windows Mobile. Stress here is definitely on "old", much less so on "good".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung however have made some efforts in remedying its usability too. Some of the most used system settings, contacts management, and the messaging department have all benefited, as well as the image and web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have decided to extend the touch interface to some of the Windows Mobile system settings. The options of the standard OS are usually displayed with a minute font and small checkboxes or sliders that are not really comfortable to set unless you pick up the stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia Home screen gives access to the Wireless manager allowing users to turn connectivity options on and off, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. You can also turn on the "Flight" and "Vibrate only" modes from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You further have the option to toggle the auto screen rotation and the mouse pointer on and off. The USB connectivity mode (Active Sync or Mass Storage) is also configurable from the Settings tab on the Home screen. The last thing that you can toggle on and off here is the the camera LED mode, which doubles as a flashlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung's very own phonebook is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contacts management is usually considered one of the strongest points of Windows Mobile. You have an unlimited contact list, unlimited info fields for each contact and excellent synchronization options. However, the small font and tiny fields make the stylus a must when you are looking up a contact or editing its details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have chosen to replace the contacts list with a touch optimized application of their own. It's accessible from the Samsung MainMenu and it's rather iPhone-like, or let's say iPhone-inspired. You can scroll the contacts by dragging your thumb across the display or quickly jump to a letter (iPhone way). The contacts list can be easily sorted by memory (Phone or SIM), by Name, company or Category, or you can easily search by gradual typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts are presented in a rather thumbable way. Only if you want to edit a contact's details, you get transferred to the regular Windows Mobile interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact you have a plethora of available info fields - and if by any rare chance, those are not enough, you can always rename some of the existing ones to use as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-optimized Phonebook may not be good at editing, but it has a handy delete mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual Windows Mobile phonebook is also available. The only advantage it brings is the Last Call field that appears when you preview a contact. It's quite handy to have the last time you called that person and it's a feature unique to Windows Mobile.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phone application of the Samsung i900 Omnia offers a large dial pad but probably its most useful feature is the Smart dialing. With Smart dialing you hardly ever need to go to the Contacts list in order to dial a number - just start typing a name or a number and you get all the matching entries from both the contacts list and the calls log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have gone so far in replicating a regular phone's dial pad, that even a long press on the # key starts the "Vibrate only" silent ringing profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call the Samsung Omnia locks the display until your call is over. To unlock it during a call you need to press the touchpad once. If you don't touch the display within a short while afterwards, it automatically locks again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also mute an incoming call by simply turning the phone face down on the table. If you turn the Omnia over again, muting gets released and the ringer resumes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As part of our reviewing routine we measured the loudspeaker performance of the Samsung i900 Omnia and compared it to a few other smart devices. One thing's for sure - you won't miss any incoming calls as the Omnia is loud enough to score the Good mark. Unfortunately, the retail Omnia that we received was not as loud as the beta unit used for the "Diamond vs. Omnia" article that you probably remember. But still, the difference amounts to a couple of decibels. The results displayed in the table are from the retail unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how it ranks. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calls log on Windows Mobile devices offers practically unlimited entries. Much like with the Phonebook, Samsung have created an entirely new Calls Log application which is much more thumb-optimized than the original one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's go at messaging is not as creative as their Contacts or Calls Log applications - they use the default Windows Mobile inbox and editors. Interestingly enough, emails and SMS on the Omnia share one and the same editor, which is rather uncommon in Windows Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xt9 prediction system is there to assist typing but you can switch it off just as easily. Another Samsung touch is the files toolbar, which allows you to attach files in your messages easy as pie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of Windows 6.1, users enjoy threaded SMS, so you can be sure you get that feature in the i900 Omnia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email inbox holds no surprises to experienced WinMo users. You have support for POP3, IMAP and Push Email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps now is a good time to mention input options on the Samsung i900 Omnia. Samsung have preinstalled three different layouts of a rather thumbable keyboard, since the default Windows Mobile keyboards are fit for stylus use only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choices include a full QWERTY keyboard, a Blackberryesque QW-ER-TY keyboard and a regular phone multi-tap keyboard. Unlike the standard WinMo keypad however, when you hit a number field, you have to manually switch the keyboard to number input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, Samsung i900 Omnia definitely wins a point when it comes to typing thanks to its vibrating touch feedback. Furthermore, since the screen auto rotation feature is available throughout the whole interface, you also benefit from a larger landscape version of all those keyboards in every application (those are especially useful in Messaging).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, much like with any other Windows Mobile Pro device, there is support for handwriting character recognition so if you wish, you can use the supplied stylus to write directly on the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management and file system performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i900 Omnia offers generous file storage capacity. The handset comes in two flavors - one with 8GB and another one with 16GB worth of data storage. Our test Omnia unit had 8 gigs on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia even has a microSD card slot, which easily worked with 4GB and 8GB memory cards. However, the downside of Omnia's implementation is that the slot is not hot-swappable - you have to remove the battery in order to access it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran a copy speed test on a Windows XP-based PC paired with the Omnia in USB Mass Storage mode. The Omnia proved rather fast in the Write operation (copying from PC to handset) but was some 30% slower in Read (copying from handset to PC). Here are the results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i900 Omnia copy/paste performance: </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that those figures will be lower on a Vista-based PC for some Microsoft-only-knows-why reason. That's another story entirely and we'd rather stayed out of it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to image browsing, the Samsung Omnia Media Album is really fast displaying and browsing those 5 megapixel images fullscreen. It's actually a full featured file browser that shows only multimedia folder contents. Since it's universal (not only photo-centric), you can filter the shown files by type - image, video, music, and documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to image browsing, the Media Album certainly benefits from the auto screen rotation feature. Zooming is as easy as on the Apple iPhone for example. You zoom in and out by simply dragging your thumb up or down the image. The first zoom step is a bit slow, but we are talking 5 megapixel images here. At this point we are really pleased with the Samsung solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on, if you want to see a slide show of your images, you can use the dedicated app that Samsung have also preinstalled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music is always important<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Touch Player caters for the music department on the Omnia. You can sort music by album, artist, and genre or you can create custom playlists. Sorting the tracks by album brings the album cover interface. The album covers look nice and large, and can also be displayed full screen while you're listening to music. We are glad that in the retail version that we received the scrolling speed is much improved as compared to the first Omnia we had a chance to play with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Samsung Touch Player lacks any equalizer presets; shuffle and repeat are the only related options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile devices have never been known for even decent audio output. Their business mindset has so far served as a good excuse for the poor audio. However, as the Samsung i900 Omnia is considered a multimedia device, it is about time this changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since we published our Diamond vs. Omnia article, we received a final retail version of the Samsung i900 Omnia. While, we weren't quite satisfied with the first Omnia audio quality, things have changed with the retail version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response of the retail Samsung i900 Omnia is good as before, however the other readings such as IMD and THD have been improved. All readings are good and some even impressive. The distortion levels are about the same as the Apple iPhone 3G, which is great. The frequency response of the two devices is also perfectly matching but this is hardly a surprise, as Samsung provide the audio chips for Apple's latest gadget. The areas where the Omnia is not so impressive are noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk but still neither is actually bad. Anyway, the results are here, so you can see for yourselves, but it's safe to conclude that the Omnia offers unsurpassed audio quality among Winodws Mobile PocketPCs. And in case you've missed it, you can learn all about our testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i900 Omnia and Apple iPhone 3G's frequency response graph match perfectly</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Portable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia is the first DivX certified Windows Mobile device, so you get DivX playback straight out of the box on the same Touch Player that is used for music playback. Now there's some confusion roaming around that the Omnia has XviD support too, but we've played with a total of four different units - each at different stage of developement and XviD support was not present on any of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a wider range of supported video formats however, you should pick a third-party solution. We opted for the popular commercial Core player, since the free TCPMP player didn't run, probably due to some incompatibilities with Windows Mobile 6.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i900 Omnia turned out pretty good at near VGA-res XviD video playback - we played a DVD rip intended for desktop PC playback and luckily there were no skipped frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, the Samsung Omnia has a widescreen display that is generally better at widescreen videos and with a slight zooming in, you get almost fullscreen playback.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio is superb<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Omnia sports a built-in FM radio and it naturally requires the headset to be plugged-in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio has an excellent interface, much like the rest of the multimedia players aboard, and is highly touch optimized. And it's packed with pretty much every feature you would need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two separate lists for stored stations - they can both store unlimited number of stations. You can also place shortcuts to six favorite radio stations on the main screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Radio player can run in the background, automatically pausing during calls, and broadcasts can be easily recorded with rather acceptable audio quality at 128kbps and 44000 kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, there is RDS support.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung i900 Omnia packs a really nice 5 megapixel camera, which produces images with a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. It comes equipped with autofocus, digital image stabilizer, face recognition, smile detection, and geotagging courtesy of the built-in GPS receiver. The LED flash next to the camera lens completes the tally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia camera shoots in landscape mode and makes use of the dedicated camera key. It's got an intuitive user interface that makes changing settings on-the-go a breeze.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Interface and usability<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since the Omnia display has a different aspect ratio than its camera sensor, the viewfinder doesn't take up the whole screen estate. Thus it easily fits two columns of controls on the left and right side of the viewfinder. You can of course opt for a fullscreen viewfinder, but this would crop the live feed from the sensor to fit the display. The resulting images however have standard resolution and don't come out cropped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia camera offers several shooting modes (single, continuous, mosaic, panorama and the smile detection one). The smile detection mode makes use of face recognition and in this mode the camera doesn't take a photo as soon you press the shutter all the way down. Instead, it waits for the smiles on all recognized faces in the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia also offers extensive shoot scenes (portrait, landscape, sports, party &amp; indoor, beach &amp; snow, sunset, dusk &amp; down, fall color, night shot, firework, text, show window, candle light, back light).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also directly control the auto focus (regular, macro and face detection) from a shortcut in your viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The additional camera settings include self-timer, white balance, color effect, ISO setup (ISO50-800), on-screen gridline and shutter sound (which unfortunately cannot be turned off).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the Omnia offers the proprietary Samsung Wide Dynamic Range setting for shooting high contrast scenes (not really that useful), as well as GPS geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So overall, you get all the goodies of a high-end cameraphone plus some extras. We'll cover image quality in a second, but first, the Samsung Omnia Panorama mode probably deserves some special attention. Samsung have made shooting panoramic images fully automatic - you're guided along the horizontal axis and images are taken automatically when your framing is just about right. However, the individual images are taken in the meager 320 x 240 pixel resolution. The produced panoramic image is so low-res it ruined it for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia panoramic mode allows making panoramas out of up to eight consequent shots. Usually the 8-shot images have too wide a field of view and all straight lines in the center distort heavily as if taken by a bad fish-eye lens. Panoramas tend to look much more natural when they comprise out of three or five frames - the geometric distortion is less prominent. It's good that the number of frames is user-configurable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already pointed out, the Samsung i900 Omnia is a really capable cameraphone. It produces crisp and tack sharp images with balanced processing and precise colors. The Omnia is probably the first PocketPC we've seen to produce impressive camera samples and we think it's safe to assume it's got the best camera among PocketPCs out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've had our share of pre-release Omnias and we saw improvement in image quality each time - especially in color rendering. Otherwise, resolution and detail have been consistently high with each unit - those can easily rival the Nokia N95 8GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We now finally have a retail unit in our hands but the camera performance is still not perfect. Some of our images seem to have some sort of tint or reduced contrast - especially those taken with some of the preset shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess all these minor glitches should be fixed by a software update later on. For now, image quality is not perfect in all shots but it shows potential that's not to be overlooked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i900 Omnia records VGA video (640 x 480 pixels) at 15fps or QVGA video (320 x 240 pixels) at 30fps. That's not much by any standard - point &amp; shoot digicams are already pushing video recording to HD, while cameraphones (even the Omnia kind with its capable processor) are still short of the VGA@30fps standard. It makes you wonder how Nokia does it with their Symbian smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two sample videos produced by the Samsung i900 Omnia. The first Omnia video is shot in MPEG4 VGA@15fps, while the second Omnia video is MPEG4 QVGA@30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first Omnia video is shot in MPEG4 VGA@15fps, while the second Omnia video is recorded in MPEG4 QVGA@30fps.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loaded with connectivity goodies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>PocketPCs are usually known for offering great connectivity options and the Samsung i900 Omnia makes no exception - HSDPA 7.2Mpbs, Wi-Fi and stereo Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR are all on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently targeting Europe/Asia, the Omnia has quad-band GSM and HSDPA 2100 MHz support. But with eyes set on the American market, there will be a localized (American 3G) version of the handset with 850/1900MHz HSDPA support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 support is also present of course, but the Samsung Omnia loses a point in its implementation for several reasons:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already commented on the transfer speeds in USB mode - they seem good enough to make file transfers comfortable, especially when transferring content to the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the good side - you can also use the memory card slot for transferring content, but unfortunately, you will have to quite annoyingly remove the battery to access it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i900 Omnia also sports a TV-out functionality using the same proprietary connectivity port. We didn't have a TV-out cable to test it as it doesn't ship with the retail package. However, the TV out settings seem extensive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Touch-centric web browser without true Flash support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i900 Omnia is equipped with the latest version of the Opera browser, which makes the Internet Explorer Mobile redundant. The Opera 9.5 browser is extensively touch-optimized and seems heavily inspired by the iPhone Safari browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it falls slightly short to deliver the same level of usability as the Safari browser, it manages to compensate by throwing in a few features that totally lack on the iPhone, such as text copy/paste and the download manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, since the Samsung i900 Omnia comes with Flash Lite 2.1 support - the web browser supports only Flash content created specifically for mobile devices. You can't watch Flash video online and in fact even most of the Flash banners on GSMArena.com didn't display. But we got to say this one more time - it's not a fault with the Opera web browser, but with the Samsung implementation of Windows Mobile. We really hope Flash Lite 3 support will be added later on with a software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That being noted, we can get back to the actual browsing experience that the Opera browser delivers. When you open a new page, it automatically gets displayed fullscreen showing the whole page content. Text is hardly readable this way, but it's much easier to navigate to the bits you are interested in. A double tap on any element zooms on it until it fits the display. If you double tap a text paragraph, it zooms in so that the font size is comfortable for reading and the text wraps to fit the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the double tap feature, the Opera 9.5 implementation on the Samsung Omnia also offers dynamic page zooming. It uses the same gesture used for zooming images in the Gallery - place your thumb dead center on the rightmost side and drag up for zooming in and drag down for zooming out. An overlay control appears to hint you're in dynamic zooming mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we already said that new websites open up fullscreen by default. Once a page has loaded, a tap on the bottom right corner brings up the available controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, you've got the address bar at the very top. At the bottom of the screen there is a row of icons that can take you back, take you to bookmarks, bring up the tab switcher, the home page or the browser settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tab switcher allows for no more than three concurrent tabs in order to prevent the RAM from getting full.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser settings are accessible from the context menu. There are not that many of them and are again touch-optimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've enabled the auto screen rotation feature of the Omnia, you can browse websites in landscape mode. The QWERTY keyboard also switches to landscape mode which is rather handy. The dynamic zooming feature works in landscape mode too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>YouTube video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update: We see a lot of commotion in the review comments and we are glad that you find this review meaningful and helpful. Now probably one of the most frequently asked questions is whether the Omnia can play YouTube videos - we have somehow overlooked saying that directly. But since we already mentioned that there is no real Flash support, you should have guessed the answer by now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never mind, here is the low down on the Omnia and web-based flash video. The Samsung i900 Omnia cannot play YouTube videos directly from the desktop version of the web site. The same holds true for every other flash video website out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only way you could possibly watch YouTube videos is via the mobile version of YouTube.com - with it videos get streamed in 3GP format over the RTSP protocol. If that sounds like mumbo-jumbo to you, here's what it means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mobile version of YouTube found at m.youtube.com gets you access to the same videos as the desktop version, however they are inferior in quality so that they can be played over the wireless carrier network - EDGE or UMTS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i900 Omnia can handle the 3GP YouTube videos with an ease thanks to the Streaming Player. The player offers video zooming, landscape view mode and even fullscreen playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 2: Since we've noticed there's still some kind of misunderstanding surrounding the YouTube video playback issue, we decided to update this YouTube chapter with a working solution for watching YouTube videos on the Samsung i900 Omnia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i900 Omnia doesn't allow YouTube playback straight out of the box. And that's reflected in the text up so far. But Windows Mobile is a versatile platform and you can expand the Omnia capabilities in the Flash video department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You probably remember the Core player, which we mentioned in the Video playback chapter of this review. It allows expanding the media playback capabilities of your Windows Mobile device especially when video is concerned - for example it adds XviD video support to the already present DivX one on the Samsung i900 Omnia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we didn't mention that the Core player has a YouTube client built right into it. It allows seamless browsing of YouTube content and most of all, it allows you full quality/full-res You Tube video playback. The Core player offers four levels of video quality - two of them use the low-quality/low-bandwidth 3GP file format, but the other two (FLV and the H.264 options) grant you access to the real thing - desktop YouTube quality on your mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how a randomly chosen video looks with the different settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, we should mention that the Core player is a commercial Windows Mobile application and we don't endorse it in any way possible. It's just used here to showcase the fact that YouTube support can be added to the Omnia. If you do your research carefully, you might as well find a free alternative application that will offer the same capabilities.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer capabilities are rich and intuitive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are easily syncable with MS Outlook. As of Windows Mobile 6.0, the Calendar allows browsing the events to come. It offers daily, weekly and monthly view. You can have the week start on either Monday or Sunday. You can also hide weekends from the Calendar if you use it for business strictly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list allows you to add tasks and assign them priority. The Notes also come in handy, as you can either type or directly write the text down on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder and Calculator go without saying. A nice surprise is that Samsung have redesigned the default Windows Mobile calculator and now it has much more pleasant looks without sacrificing usability, and it's more thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the excellent Clock application that gets you touch optimized access to alarms, anniversaries, the world clock and the stop watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alarms are rather easy to setup and turn on or off. They can be repeated on selected weekdays and are unlimited in numbers. You can also setup different anniversaries, which can get repeated on an annual basis. And finally, the World clock is most nice looking and intuitive application of the kind we've seen lately. A tap on the blue mini map opens it up fullscreen and you can drag around to select the time zone you are interested in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application is the rather handy Search application, capable of searching throughout the whole file system and applications. You can set filters, so that the application searches only in the places you need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Your mobile office is here too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of the Office Mobile, you also have the OneNote application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the pre-installed Boratech File Viewer, there is also support for viewing PDF documents. Performance when working with PDF file is commendable, but that's to be expected with the powerful processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pre-installed Biz Card Reader is a rather handy utility to scan text or business cards and it comes with character recognition. It does an impressive job at that - at least in English.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Business card scanners are not something new but that's among the first document scanners implemented in a GSM handsets, and it's quite good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The card scanning is also impressively accurate. All the contact details can also be stored in your Phonebook should you choose so.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All the software on-board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i900 Omnia comes loaded with additional third-party software to meet various Windows Mobile user needs. It's got regular stuff such as the RSS Reader and Streaming player, but it has some really original applications to go along. You should bear in mind though, that the software package might be market-specific.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, it's nice of Samsung to have preinstalled both a Task Switcher and a Task Manager on the Omnia. The Task Switcher is readily available throughout the whole user interface upon a press-and-hold of the side mounted Main Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Task Switcher just displays all your currently running applications, allowing you to toggle or terminate them if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Task Manager is more advanced and is available through the Settings menu. It not only displays the currently running processes, but also their RAM and CPU footprint. You can't switch between them however and in this respect it reminds a lot of the Windows XP/Vista task manager. The good thing is that it's also capable of showing all the system processes that are currently running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, the RSS Reader application is rather self explanatory. It gives you quick access to RSS feeds for staying on top of the latest news and content at your favorite web places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ArcSoft Streaming player grants access to custom sources of streaming audio and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Podcasts application allows you to subscribe and download video and audio podcasts of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A touch-optimized unit converter is also on board. It has much the same interface as all other touch-optimized applications onboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have even thrown in a Video Editor, which not only allows you to edit videos, but you can also create ones out of a set of images - for example your camera photos. The resulting videos are in QVGA resolution in MPEG4 format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now here is a short MPEG4 video that we've created with the Video editor demonstrating what it can do for you if you devote it several minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, there is the ShoZu client, which connects you to the ShoZu community. You can upload and share videos and photos (with geo-tagging support) or you can connect to Flickr, Facebook, YouTube, Blogger and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Goggle Package gives you access to the Google Search and Gmail online services, as well as the pre-installed Google Maps 2.0.1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the Picture Frame application allows you to use the i900 Omnia as a digital picture frame with highly customizable content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides displaying a slide show of images in landscape mode, the Picture Frame also offers a total of 5 different clock/date styles. You can have music playing in the background too and, if needed, event alerts such as incoming message or alarms can be suppressed when Digital Frame is running. Furthermore, the interface of the application is highly touch optimized.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A cool GPS navigator<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i900 Omnia features a built-in GPS receiver - probably manufactured by Samsung themselves, though that's not confirmed by the company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia supports A-GPS - it means you can download current satellite data over Wi-Fi or the 2G/3G network for a much faster satellite lock upon cold start. While a cold start can take anywhere between 5 or 7 minutes, with A-GPS lock is obtained within a minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia doesn't have a GPS navigation application pre-installed, so you have to purchase one separately. Google Maps however comes on-board, so you can use that as a primer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The i900 Omnia performed admirably as an in-car navigation unit. While its display is not legible enough in bright sunlight, we had no problem with it on the dashboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did a dedicated GPS battery test to see how far you can get with the Omnia in GPS mode. We clocked the Samsung i900 at standstill position with constant full satellite lock. It pulled off a nice result of 4 hours and 20 minutes. You should bear in mind that in a moving vehicle those numbers will be lower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just for the sake of comparison, the HTC Touch Cruise and the HTC TyTN II lasted about 3.5 - 4 hours in this same test. The Asus P750 however managed to outshine them all by a good margin - it kept going for 6 hours straight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i900 Omnia has left us with nothing but good impressions. Everything about the device speaks "high-tech" - from the innovative touch interface through the rich connectivity and multimedia capabilities to the exclusive hardware characteristics such as the optical touchpad or the 5 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's probably the first time that a Windows Mobile PocketPC turns out as a fully-fledged multimedia device. Samsung have made sure that the i900 Omnia is equally fit for both business and entertainment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course there are a few downers - some things are not up to the expected high standards (such as the sunlight legibility of display) while other stuff will benefit from some tweaking or software updating (such as the camera performance and the Flash support).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But overall the Samsung Omnia is a well-balanced product that seems in for some major success on the market. We think that "balanced" is the key word here as the major competitors - the HTC Touch Diamond and the iPhone 3G - seem to offer more in some respects but severely fall behind in others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And what's more, at a startup price of 500 euro, the Samsung i900 Omnia is also a good value for money as this kind of cash would hardly buy you a more complete feature pack than that.</paragraph>
