			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>They say music soothes even the savage beast. In the case of the HTC Sensation XL, it just makes it cooler. The Sensation XL shares its design and mammoth 4.7" screen with the Titan, but the XL is part of the Android squad and packs a lyrical iBeats headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XL uses almost exactly the same hardware as the Titan - the major difference is that the XL packs four Android capacitive keys and there's no hardware shutter key, but that's about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single Scorpion core in the Snapdragon chipset runs at 1.5GHz again and the camera is an 8MP unit that records 720p video. Even the screen is the same 4.7" WVGA S-LCD unit, not the qHD resolution of the Sensation XE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the list of pros and cons to sum up how well the merging of Titan hardware and Sensation software went.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One major addition to the Sensation XL that the Titan lacks is the Beats setup. It includes a Monster iBeats headset in the box (those are rather pricy if you have to buy them separately) and special audio processing done on the inside tuned by none other than Dr. Dre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the other Androids by HTC (or in fact most other phones), the bigger screen of the XL is more accommodating to web browsing, watching videos and reading ebooks. The more screen real estate should be better for games too - if the Adreno 205 GPU is up to it (it's getting old, but should still be OK with most games).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, time to pull out the lauded iBeats headset out of the box and give them a listen while we tour the hardware of the HTC Sensation XL.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XL comes in a big box, befitting a big phone. When you open it up, you see the phone in the middle with the earplugs of the iBeats headset on its sides. The headset is courtesy of Monster and is slightly different than the retail version: it has a set of three chrome-plated music controls instead of a single button. The middle Play/Pause button doubles as a call key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headset has the same eye-catching red cabling we saw on the Sensation XE headset, even though the XL doesn?t have the matching red accents (just the red Beats logo on the back). Still, it looks cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a fancy pouch too with some spare ear tips of varying size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, HTC will be offering a limited edition version of the Sensation XL package, which replaces the iBeats headphones with an over-ear headset, the Solo. You can see those in our Sensation XL hands-on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Sensation XL box contains the usual boring stuff as well - a compact charger that uses the provided microUSB cable to charge the phone. There are manuals too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL isn't as extra large as its name might suggest. Measuring 132.5 x 70.7 x 9.9 mm, it's not much bigger than handsets with 4.3" screens. And while the 162.5g of weight are on the heavy side, we've seen smaller phones that weigh as much. So, the phone is fairly compact for something bearing the XL tag.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC have kept the design of the Sensation XL very clean. There are no different materials patched up together like on some other phones (*cough*Sensation*cough*). We especially like the big aluminum plate of the back that wraps around the sides too - it gives the phone a really premium feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you put it next to phones with 4.3" screens, the HTC Sensation XL is noticeably bigger, but not huge. It's still phone-sized compared to 5+ inch phoneblets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-LCD capacitive unit of the HTC Sensation XL has WVGA resolution and not qHD, which has been a common sight of late in HTC phones. It was obviously not an option for the Titan (WP7 supports only WVGA for now) but Android scales happily to higher resolutions (720p resolution would have been amazing on the XL's screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put things into perspective, the HTC Sensation XE's 4.3" touchscreen has a pixel density of 256ppi, while the XL manages only 199ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, the screen size is quite a stretch for the resolution. This is most embarrassingly visible when reading text (e.g. in the web browser). Text is as good as impossible to read at max zoom-out - you need to zoom in, but that means you lose some of the real-estate advantage that the large screen gives you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resolution aside, the screen is one of the best we've seen by HTC - it has brilliant viewing angles (there's some minor contrast loss, but that's it) and colors are very vivid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We measured the brightness and contrast of the Sensation XL's screen and (expectedly) it turned out very close to that of the Titan. The display is pretty bright though the black levels could be better. Contrast stays above 1000:1, which is pretty good, better than the Sensation XE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display coating is highly reflective though, which ruins sunlight legibility - the reflections of the sky often eclipse the screen contents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the HTC Sensation XL's screen there's a secondary 1.3 MP video-call camera, a proximity sensor and an ambient light sensor. There's a charging/notification LED there too that remains invisible when it's off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Four haptic-enabled capacitive touch controls are placed below the 4.7"display. The usual Android keys (Home, Menu, Back and Search) are well-spaced and easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Sensation XL are light on ports and buttons - the left side houses an exposed microUSB port, which doubles as a charging port. The right side has only the big volume control, which isn't the most comfortable volume rocker we've used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the HTC Sensation XL features the 3.5 mm audio jack, a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation and the power/lock button. The power/lock button is flush with the surface to prevent accidental presses but is relatively easy to use - but you have to use two hands, the phone is just too big to reach the button with one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the XL is the primary microphone and the battery cover latch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over at the back, the 8MP camera lens sits between a dual LED flash combo and a loudspeaker grill. The camera protrudes so the phone rests on it when you place it down. You need to be careful what surfaces you put it on or the lens might get scratched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the battery cover latch causes the screen and phone innards to pop out. Effectively, the battery cover wraps the phone's body in. This solution helps avoid wobbles and squeaks but doesn't quite qualify as a unibody. We have a full-sized battery cover and a phone that divides into two equally sized parts. For a real unibody, you need to check out the HTC Radar or the older HTC Legend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the back cover is made almost entirely of aluminum and quite a thick piece of it too - you can see "ribs" on the side of the cover to ensure there isn't even a millimeter of the back that gives way when you press it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a patch of plastic at the bottom, which houses the wireless antennas. The antennas are well isolated and don't suffer from the death grip. The only downside of this solution is that all wireless signals are cut off when you take the back cover off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, underneath you'll find a 1600 Li-Ion battery and the SIM card compartment. There's no microSD card slot here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery could have been bigger, for reference the Sensation XE packs a 1730mAh battery (though it needs it to feed its dual-core CPU).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We performed a detailed battery test on the HTC Sensation XL and it lasted 40 hours when subjected to general usage. The battery lived long in 3G calls - 9 hours and 30 minutes, longer than the advertised 6 hours and 50 minutes. The Sensation XL lasts 5 hours and 20 minutes of web browsing over Wi-Fi and 6 hours and 10 minutes of video watching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those numbers compare favorably against the competition, except the video playing performance, which is 2-3 hours behind the leaders of the pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL fits well in the hand in most pockets. Still, the sizable screen means you'll have trouble reaching the top items on the display, at least at first. You get used to it but still isn't the most comfortable thing in the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This aside, the build quality of the XL is great - the large slab of aluminum on the back gives the phone a premium feel and even the white plastic for the antennas is great. The phone is a bit on the heavy side, but it's not too much of a burden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One processor core for an extra 0.4" of screen - is the tradeoff from the Sensation XE worth it? We already saw how the 4.7" screen performs, later we'll be running benchmarks to gauge the performance difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first we'll do the overview of the latest Sense UI, which while familiar, packs a few changes since we last saw it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Updated Sense 3.5 brings slight improvements<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL comes with Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread and a new version of the HTC Sense, v3.5. Gingerbread and the HTC custom skin on top should be familiar enough though some changes stuck out early on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video demo of the latest Sense UI running on the Sensation XL - the phonebook is one of the things that changed, so that's one thing to look out for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC lockscreen has to be the most functional, most customizable lockscreen we've seen yet. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, you can drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's not the end of it - the HTC Sensation XL comes with six different lockscreens preinstalled. You can access the others from the Personalize menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default homescreen just shows the ring, four shortcuts, the time and the homescreen wallpaper. Then there's the Photo album lockscreen, which tosses photos from your gallery in cool 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the Friend Stream widget which shows SNS updates from your friends and the Weather widget which shows off the Sense UI's cool weather animations. There's Stocks too - with quotes flying up or down, again, in eye-pleasing 3D. Finally, there's the Clock lockscreen which shows a bigger clock - you can pick any of the 11 clock widgets you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you can't download new lockscreens from HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going further than the lockscreen reveals the familiar Sense homescreen. There, we meet a scroll arc at the bottom that is just an indication of which homescreen pane you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s Leap view instead - tap the home key (while on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's new here is that you can add and delete panels, not just reorder them. There's a 7 panel maximum, which is enough to fit a great deal of widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense comes with HTC proprietary Scenes ? essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes and you can get more scenes off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but the customization goes deep ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper and use different colors for various UI elements. They can also replace the standard dock, lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can choose between two different sorting options - alphabetically or most recent - but you can't rearrange them manually. There's a list layout, where two-finger alphabet scrolling is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? All apps, Frequent and Favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of items to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are thirteen different clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Twitter widget, for instance, shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet/update status. The other version displays @mentions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the bottom of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second "button" is Remove, which deletes the widget as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. A press and hold of the Home button works too. The notification area is tabbed too - the second tab has toggles for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings and the last line shows used/free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard task switcher, you get a task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another useful app that HTC preloaded is the usage monitor - it tracks you data, call and message usage. There are apps in the Market that do the same, but this one is styled to match the rest of the interface. We wish it had a widget for at-a-glance usage info though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast boot feature is enabled on the HTC Sensation XL but it won?t work if you have removed the battery ? in that case it will do a regular slow boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool things is apps preserve their state after the restart ? so if you were browsing a web site before turning the phone off, the browser will restore your session.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our guess is, HTC use some sort of Suspend or Hibernate routine as seen in regular computers to implement the fast boot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hearing about a single-core CPU and Adreno 205 GPU made us worry a bit, but the Sense UI runs silky smooth without even a hint of lag. The 768MB of RAM proved enough too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we would be remiss if we didn?t subject the HTC Sensation XL to our usual set of benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is BenchmarkPi - a CPU-intensive single-core benchmark. Here, the XL scored very close to its single-core rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack is a multithreading-enabled benchmark - the Sensation XL was tested in single-thread mode, while others were tested in multi-threading mode. Surprisingly, the XL was faster than the dual-core XE (that one had software issues we think). Still, the Sensation XL was within reach of the 2x 1GHz Optimus 2X (running Gingerbread).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 205 graphics however posted dismal performance in NenaMark 2 - while most games right aren't as heavy as the benchmark, newer high-end games will be unplayable on the Sensation XL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two in-browser benchmarks managed to surprise us - HTC must have worked really hard on the JavaScript engine as it beat all others hands down. The high clock speed also helped out quite a bit here (JavaScript is single threaded), but can't account for all the performance advantage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Updated phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XL has HTC?s all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed and with more tabs than the stock Android. Version 3.5 of Sense merges the Phone and People apps into one. So, you have the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we liked about the phonebook is that it makes good use of the big screen. The list of contacts has two lines per entry, the contact's name and their latest SNS update (with an icon to identify the social network used).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. The interface is tabbed here but it has been reorganized and the new view makes more sense (if you'll pardon the pun).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is called Thread - it lists regular messages, email and call history with that contact. It's the next tab, Updates, that handles the social networking side of things - it lists both events with that contact from online calendars and also SNS status update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fourth final tab holds the online galleries of the contact, including Facebook and Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re switching from another phone don?t worry ? you don?t even need a computer to pull your contacts, messages and calendar items from the old phone into your new Sensation XL. The Transfer app supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an old trick (Symbian-powered Nokias have been doing this for ever) and most people would probably go with syncing the contacts over the cloud, but still it?s a handy tool to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart and voice dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had no issues with reception and in-call audio quality with the HTC Sensation XL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). The HTC Sensation XL has both Smart Dialing and Voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XL knows some accelerometer-based tricks ? turning the phone over will mute the ringer of an incoming call while placing it down starts the loudspeaker automatically when you are in the middle of a call. The other feature is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Sensation XL fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored an Average mark putting it somewhere in the middle among its competitors. The Titan had a different, wider loudspeaker grill and performed much better than the Sensation XL.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text messaging does it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Sensation XL are capable of handling all sorts of text messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can set the preview to be one, two or three lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered ? the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. ?drx? matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enabled delivery notifications and you can backup text messages to the internal storage memory (and restore them from there later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the Sensation XL boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. While it?s still not as good as a hardware one, it?s the next best thing ? the 4.7? screen has enough real estate for big, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is big and covers over half of the screen in landscape mode. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Mail app almost as good as Gmail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL comes with two email apps ? the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app has been updated too. Emails are organized into three tabs and can be sorted by date, sender, subject, priority or size (both ascending and descending). You can browse all folders for the email account or view all inboxes combined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go for the latter option, emails are color-coded so it's easy to tell which email belongs to which account. You can mass delete emails or mark them as read too (you can't perform other operations en masse like you can in Gmail though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the tabs. The first one, Received, contains all the emails. Then comes the Thread tab - it groups related emails into conversations (hit the down arrow to see the list), but once you open an email you can only view them one at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are previous/next buttons in the menu, but it would have been more convenient to view all messages together on the screen (like in the Gmail app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, you have a Favorites tab that holds only email from contacts in the Favorites group and an Invite tab that collect invitations from online calendars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Sensation XL lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Beautiful image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gallery stacks photos like the vanilla Android gallery does (it used to display a list of thumbnails). The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution. You can also select which folders the gallery should display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ones you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo on the HTC Sensation XL is very straightforward ? tap the share button, pick your preferred sharing method and select one or multiple photos/videos to share. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube or use DLNA to push photos to your compatible TV too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options ? you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sensation XL supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too. And if you pan past the edge of an image, you'll scroll into the next image, which is a handy way to browse multiple photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player has spotty codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the All videos subfolder in the Gallery. There's no dedicated video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files are displayed as a grid and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr, even apps like Dropbox if you have it installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC Sensation XL offers a full screen toggle (stretches the video to the screen's aspect) and you can scrub through videos. There's no subtitle support though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player was hit or miss when it came to playing videos. Non-HD resolutions would play trouble-free for all formats supported (MP4, DivX, XviD, MKV, WMV). Even some HD videos managed to play but only just - we managed to get a 720p WMV video play smoothly, a 720p MKV played (but there were rendering issues, probably encoding specific) and 720p DivX/XviD simply failed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beats Audio and HTC Enhancer presets are available in the video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes handy too ? the Sensation XL can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no TV-Out functionality of any kind, which means you're stuck watching the videos on the Sensation XL's 4.7" screen, you can't hook it up to an HDTV.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Beats Audio enhances the music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player has been updated a bit - the initial screen has two big buttons for My Library and My Playlists, with links under them to help you discover new music (album and singles chart, newly released albums and singles and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard view for My Library is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six categories (Albums, Songs, Playlists, Genres, and Genres) through a drop-down menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another dropdown at the top of the initial screen lets you switch between the music library on the phone and DLNA media servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs but that worked rather strangely. You can skip between different albums/artists but not individual songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XL offers Beats Audio sound enhancement to boost the listening experience. It was supposed to be available only when you plug in your Monster headphones but you can switch it on with any headset or headphones out there. It probably won't sound as good as with the intended Beats-made headset but you can if you want to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a small problem with the enhancements - you can switch off the Beats Audio enhancement, which enables the HTC enhancer. It's one or the other though, there's no "unenhanced" mode or any other equalizer preset. Still, if you're using the iBeats headset (as you should be), you're better off with the Beats Audio enhancement anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the bottom corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. Other goodies include looking up a song on YouTube or updating the album art for the current or all songs. You can enable auto update too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share a song or use DLNA to play the song through a DLNA-enabled audio system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a neat feature - a 3D card stays on the lockscreen that lets you control the music player (previous, next and play/pause). The card also shows the album art and name of the song and artist. You can flip the card - it's backside shows album art and track info too, but lacks music controls (you can use that to prevent accidental taps that change the song).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a music recognition app preloaded on the Sensation XL, SoundHound. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Beats audio can't be switched off<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like the Sensation XE, the Sensation XL comes with the Beats audio enchaments and quirks. Once again we were unable to turn off the equalizer on the phone. Even if you disable the Beats audio option, the HTC enhancements are automatically activated, so there's no way to get what's regarded as a "clean" audio output from this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while turning on certain equalizer presets are what most people prefer anyway, real audiophiles know that it's the perfectly clean, untouched audio output that makes a great music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the good news is that the rest of the readings in our test were pretty good. The HTC Sensation XL did pretty well in the active external amplifier part of the test. It was one of the loudest smartphones we have seen (matching the Sensatino XE) and got some excellent scores. Unfortunately, that equalizerfrequency response can in no way be interpreted as a good result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the HTC Sensation XL performance with headphones plugged in, it's pretty good, but not quite as impressive. The volume levels drop from class-leading to above average and intermodulation distortion creeps in. Stereo crosstalk rises a bit too, but it's nothing to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see how the Sensation XL did for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the first Sensation, the FM radio app on the Sensation XL starts and turns off a lot faster (about a second or two).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 8MP camera is better than Titan's<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels and records 720p video @ 30fps. There?s a dual-LED flash / video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very space efficient - even more so after the Sense 3.5 update. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. The still/video toggle and front/back camera toggles have been combined in a single menu and the Effects button has been moved to the top left corner - this freed up space for the Scenes and Settings button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a gallery shortcut (a thumbnail of the last photo taken) in the bottom left corner and a virtual zoom lever along the bottom. By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off (note that cropping reduces the resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Scenes are pretty cool - especially since they grew an extra feature, Backlight HDR, which previous versions of HTC's camera software lack. We tested it, you can check out the photos below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL has face detection and touch focus. Continuous autofocus is enabled too which is good to have on a phone like the Sensation XL with no hardware shutter key. On the downside, the continuous autofocus may be way off in some shots - the only way to be certain you have the right focus is to tap and hold the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geo-tagging is an option too as is Auto upload - all you have to do is pick a service (Facebook or Flickr), an album and when to upload (Immediately, daily and Wi-Fi only), the phone will take care of the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other image effects too. For example, Warp places a control point on the screen, which you can drag with your finger and see the result in real time. Depth of field is another such effect ? it adds a radius slider besides the control point and will blur everything in the photo that falls outside the circle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrary to what we expected, the HTC Sensation XL produced much better photos than the Titan. We think the key is better image processing (as we're all but sure that both phones use the exact same camera module).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise reduction treads lightly leaving fine detail mostly untouched. There's visible noise but not all that much (a small percentage of that noise is of the color noise variety). The dynamic range isn't all that wide, which leads to clipping (most common in the highlights but present in the shade too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color balance is quite accurate but the Sensation XL does oversaturate colors to make them pop. There are traces of oversharpening and some purple fringing visible in the photos too, but shots usually turn out very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've got a bunch of samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's the HDR sample. It really improves the camera's performance in resolving the shades. The camera takes several shots, so for best results you should use a tripod. It also works best for static scenes - you can see the "ghosting" in the moving cars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fist image is a 100% crop from HDR and non-HDR shots to highlight the differences between the two modes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 8MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ISO chart shows the slightest trace of a pink spot but otherwise the XL does pretty well in synthetic resolution. The next chart makes the noise pretty visible in its flat grey color - also the patches to the right show how lightly the noise reduction threads. The final chart show pleasing (if oversaturated colors).</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>720p video does effects, slo-mo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but only before you start shooting ? then the focus is locked and won?t change unless you tap an area on the screen, which will cause the camera to refocus on that area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One new feature here is the 2x slo-motion mode - it only works for resolutions up to WVGA. This mode also disables the audio recording. Our unit had a problem and recorded videos at 8fps, so we can't post a sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have effects for videos too - Grayscale, Sepia, Negative, Solarize, Posterize and Aqua.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you're done recording, you have an option to trim the beginning and the end of a video in case you started too early or you let the recording run for too long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot in .MP4 format in 720p resolution at 25 frames per second (instead of 30fps). Still the Sensation XL's videos were mostly smooth with only the occasional jitter. The videos have a relatively low 5.2Mbps bitrate, but at least they're recorded with stereo audio (130Kbps bitrate at 44.1kHz sampling rate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality isn't bad for a 720p shooter, but the high compression does away with most of the fine detail. There's clipping in the shadows and highlights (again) and the colors come out oversaturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the still camera, videos from the Sensation XL and the Titan are close in terms of quality (though the Titan did hit a higher frame rate of 30fps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched sample 720p@30fps clip (0:16s, 10.9MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a video uploaded to YouTube for convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the HTC Sensation XL in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 720p mobile camcorders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can spot that the compression is heavier in the shades than in well-lit areas. In the dark, color noise is apparent and fine detail is lost. The third chart shows there's more to be desired from the video's resolution - and that frames are oversharpened.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-stocked connectivity, but lacks TV-Out<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL has a complete connectivity set. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and blazing fast dual-band 3G: 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink thanks to HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Connected media app handles all sorts of DLNA connections ? it plays media to and from devices on the network with just a couple of clicks. Apps like the Gallery and music player have such functionality built in too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computers Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive now have big, thumbable icons, which is great since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support 1 to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable ?allowed users? only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn?t encounter death grip issues with the Sensation XL - if you cup the phone, the wireless indicators go down a notch, but the signal still goes through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wish the Sensation XL had MHL connectivity to connect to HDTVs like its XE sibling has.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent browser limited by the hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL has the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread web browser with Sense UI 3.5 polish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser goes into full-screen when the web page finishes loading and has very minimalistic UI, which leaves almost all of the large 4.7" screen to the page's content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an URL bar at the top of the screen flanked by a back and refresh keys. Once you zoom in and pan around the page, even that bar disappears. Still, there are plenty of options - you have to press the menu key to reveal them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are home and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out even more options ? stuff like find on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sensation XL's browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes even longer texts extremely easy to read on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then the low pixel density makes it illegible) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. You can tag bookmarks which is a great way to organize them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL has full Flash support and YouTube videos up to 480p played smoothly. HD videos however prove too much for the CPU and the videos get extremely choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use the YouTube app if you find navigating YouTube in the browser hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried out a few Flash games and they worked fine as well. You can play the Flash content in full screen and landscape mode, which makes the most out of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.3 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag which is the way of the future, now that Adobe have given up on mobile Flash.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer with Office document editing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Sensation XL, with a mobile Office app to boot that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word and Excel documents but not 2007 docs or any presentations. Oddly, you can edit existing PowerPoint presentations and Office 2007 docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files. The on-screen keyboard does cut down the available space in half but if you zoom out you can still fit a reasonable amount of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This version of Polaris gives less editing options than we're used to - you can do copy, cut and paste, then apply bold, italic and underline styles and highlight text and that's it. There used to be font style options here but now they're inexplicably gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you can edit formulas in Excel spreadsheets, you have to type them in manually (there's no wizard or even a list of functions here) and selecting cells happens one by one - you can't just tap and drag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can download them into the internal memory too if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Desk clock app turns your Sensation XL into a? well, Desk clock. The option to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night is gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app lets you quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. You can use the Stocks lockscreen too. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an HTC-branded flashlight app too ? it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick lookup is a handy app that lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatted for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Facebook and Twitter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which let you post on the world?s largest social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Facebook app is available, which enables things like Facebook Chat (there's a separate app for that too) and Facebook Places (which lets you to check into the likes of Foursquare).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app for Android also comes preinstalled ? some might prefer it over Peep (they both integrate with the phonebook so you don?t have to actually start the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app is the latest version too ? tweets can be geo-tagged, you can snap a photo to include in the tweet straight in the app (uploaded automatically to yfrog or TwitPic) and there are handy buttons to reply to or retweet a message.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market, HTC Hub and HTC Likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Market uses several side-scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. This organization reminds a lot of the Apple's App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make finding apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to look for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Market items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTCSense.com integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your Sensation XL contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the Sensation XE in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy but if you?re using an updated browser you should be fine. However, HTCSense.com failed to load properly in Internet Explorer 9 but it worked once we enabled Compatibility Mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and HTC Locations to navigate you<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in about a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation XL also comes with HTC Locations, an app developed in cooperation with TomTom (provider of the software) and Route66 (providing the maps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HTC Locations you can download country maps for free, or just cache maps as you browse (the size of the cache is adjustable). Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can calculate new routes even when offline ? and Gmaps can?t (it can only reroute you, not calculate a new route).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plotting a route with HTC Locations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t do voice-guided navigation for free like Ovi Maps though ? but still, you can use the list of instructions and tap the next and pervious arrows to see the next turn. Not ideal but it?s a great addition, especially since it?s free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can always pay for a voice-guided navigation license too - it's cheaper than buying a dedicated GPS unit. You get a 30-day trial to see if it's worth it or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better look of what?s ahead. It?s just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode ? at first it seems choppy, but that?s only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world). You could use two fingers to rotate the camera manually too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's certainly nice to be able to choose between platforms. But while there aren't that many handsets to choose from in WP7 land, Androids come in all shapes and sizes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that the HTC Sensation XL isn't pretty unique. With a massive 4.7" screen and solid aluminum build, not to mention the smooth running Sense UI, the XL can scratch your tablet itch. And your itch for a better portable MP3 player too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not tablet-sized, but unlike actual tablets, there?s always room in a pocket for the Sensation XL. And that screen is big enough for tasks like web browsing (the browser performance impressed us too) and reading texts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processor behaved admirably on most counts but the Adreno 205 GPU was a disappointment. The limited storage also might put a crimp in your movie watching (16GB still fits enough DVD-quality movies though and you have the option of using of HTC Watch).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of the Sensation XL surprised us pleasantly though, by beating its Titan twin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But sometimes a big screen is what you want and you're willing to turn a blind eye to the drawbacks. Here are some alternatives that offer a big screen too, plus a little extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan is the obvious alternative - it's more or less the same phone, but with the exciting Windows Phone Mango OS. It has most of the same weaknesses as the Sensation XL though and Windows Phone isn't as customizable as Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Samsung Galaxy Nexus - 4.65" of 720p SuperAMOLED goodness are hard to resist. You also get more processing power (1.2GHz dual-core CPU, better graphics), it comes in 16/32GB options (memory not expandable) and you do get the latest version of Android - plus a promise for quick updates to the next releases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Raider 4G has a slightly smaller screen - 4.5" - but it is qHD and you get a more powerful chipset (dual core, 1GB RAM), expandable memory, and MHL TV-Out. And let's not forget the LTE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Titan ? Samsung Galaxy Nexus ? HTC Raider 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The US also enjoys a couple of Galaxy S II variants - the Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket i727 and T-Mobile's Samsung Galaxy S II, both of which pack 4.5" WVGA SuperAMOLED Plus screens, fast dual-core CPUs, expandable memory and MHL TV-Out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to go even bigger ? and we mean anywhere, not just America ? there's the Samsung Galaxy Note. With a monster of a 5.3" WXGA SuperAMOLED, it's a Galaxy S II on steroids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket i727 ? T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S II ? Samsung Galaxy Note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Titan manages to get ahead of others within the rules and regulations of Windows Phone, the HTC Sensation XL is a tougher sell. It?s got excellent build quality and a solid set of features, but it would be hard to recommend against any of the flagships, in whose category it?s unfortunate to be. Still, it doesn?t count entirely on luck. If you can?t beat them, iBeats them.</paragraph>
