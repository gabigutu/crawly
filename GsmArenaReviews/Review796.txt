			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG's last attempt at tablets felt like something they did to just see if they still have it. No, there was nothing wrong with the G Pad 8.3 - except perhaps that an LTE version took quite a while. The LG G Pad 7.0 is obviously the economy package - but clearly showing a lot more intent. It's part of a squad including an 8-incher and a 10.1" tablet, all powered by a lower-midrange Snapdragon 400 and featuring WXGA screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sounds like an affordable tablet and the LG G Pad 7.0 sure looks like one. By no means cheap-looking though - LG never made a Nexus tablet but it may not have looked much different than this. The LG G Pad 7.0 is indeed not the sharpest tool in the shed but it isn't all bad either. For starters LG is bringing its flat new Optimus UI on top of the still fairly recent Android 4.4.2 KitKat, in an attempt to carry the polished experience over from the LG G3 flagship to a bigger form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G Pad 7.0</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen isn't of the highest resolution and does offer sub-Retina ppi levels but it is an IPS unit meaning you'll get solid viewing angles, which is always nice in a tablet. The processor will more than suffice as well - altogether shaping up as a solid compact device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when we factor in the tempting price tag LG has hung on this seven-incher, it all starts to look brighter yet. Here's the complete package of the LG G Pad 7.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even manufacturers you've never heard of are giving compact tablets a go and the diversity of Android-powered 7-inchers will make your head spin. LG look like they know what they're doing and the G Pad 7.0 is trying to make it easy for users who shop on a budget but expect quality and at least decent equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price will help you live with some of the drawbacks but you'd be better off knowing them up front. The chipset isn't the best around with only 1GB of RAM and there's no 3G enabled option being offered, let alone LTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the price is right, placing the LG G Pad 7.0 comfortably below what most current compact slates will ask for - we mean reputable makers of course. If you pay a little extra you might be able to get a 2013 Nexus 7.0, which wins on specs and experience for the most part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It must be important for LG to show they're taking tablets seriously again and trying to get back at Samsung at least in the lower midrange. That said, the G Pad 7.0 can be the right device to get users interested and spur more serious investment - perhaps a successor to the G Pad 8.3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So are the IR blaster and the latest Optimus UI enough to make up for the underwhelming hardware? Is the price? The LG G Pad 7.0 is affordable and likeable - but just how capable and efficient? Let's see.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 comes in a small retail box that holds the tablet itself, a 1.2A adapter and a microUSB cable. Nothing more, nothing less - but for the price the G Pad is reasonably covered.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 has a very plain design without flashy accents. The one we had for review was the black one, but it's also available with a more eye-catching blue (or rather cyan) back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It isn't incredibly slim either but we like the feel of the device in hand. The matte soft plastic at the back extends to wrap the sides of the tablet, which makes for a nice and comfortable grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slate isn't too heavy at 293g and stands at 189.3 x 113.8 x 10.1mm - the kind of size and weight to allow easy and comfortable hold, single-handed as well. A direct competitor, the 7" Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, has shed a few millimeters off in each direction but the difference will hardly be felt in actual use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're no hardware controls on the G Pad, the navigation keys are on the 7" screen and the only other thing to note is a front-facing camera above the display. There's just enough bezel to comfortably hold the tablet without making the screen look too small like on cheaper devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is mostly flat, subtly curved towards the edges. There're no sharp angles to dig into your palms and the flat surface is reasonably slip-proof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the LG G Pad 7.0 is enjoyable. It feels light and is comfortable to hold with one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only real complaint we have is the location of the two speaker grilles on the back. If they were placed on the front you would get better-directed audio and wouldn't cover them up when holding the tablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 has the power button way up on its right side next to the volume rocker. If you're using the tablet in portrait mode, reaching the button is a stretch, but in landscape it's perfectly placed above the display and well within reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the double-tap to lock/unlock feature will save you the hassle. The G Pad 7.0 also offers LG proprietary Knock code feature, but more on that later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features no controls whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the LG G Pad 7.0 has the microUSB port for charging and PC connection. The top features a 3.5mm headphone jack, an IR port and the microSD card slot, which has its own plastic flap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is where the 3.15MP camera lens is, no flash whatsoever. There's a speaker grille in each bottom corner but there's actually just one driver inside so you won't get stereo sound. The thing is they're not perfectly spaced and easily covered by your palm when holding the G Pad 7.0 landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would have preferred the speaker grilles to be further apart and facing front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pad 7.0 isn't as thin and spectacular as the Samsung Galaxy Tab S or as exquisite as the iPad mini. These are in a different league altogether. The seven-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is spot on though - that's the kind of competition the G Pad will be looking at - and cheaper tablets from lesser known brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feel isn't bad either - it's just simple and inexpensive - without feeling cheap. It feels nice to hold and operate.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>7" HD display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 7" display on the LG G Pad 7.0 has a resolution 800 x 1280 px, which results in a pixel density of around 216ppi. The number isn't particularly indicative of impressive sharpness. Held at arm's length we'd say the lack of sharpness is noticeable but not a huge issue - it's when you look closer that things start to look pixelated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IPS matrix of the G Pad 7.0 screen helps with viewing angles and colors look good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement of the LG G Pad 7.0 is a classic RGB matrix, with equally sized red, green and blue subpixels to each pixel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the LG G Pad 7.0 has good contrast, reasonable blacks, but less than stellar brightness. The screen is very dim, even at maximum brightness - it will do at home in the evening but will be of little use outdoors, especially since it's exceptionally reflective.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 has a 4,000mAh battery and, given that it isn't the most powerful tablet and the screen isn't particularly bright and pixel-rich, the battery capacity should be more than enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 posted quite impressive numbers in the browsing test and did well in the video playback. The G Pad 7.0 reached almost 19 hours of video playback, which is insanely good. Keep in mind that this test isn't performed at the highest screen brightness setting, but rather at about 50%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pad 7.0 did a great job in web browsing as well - lasting 12 hours and 22 minutes. To put things in perspective, here are the results of other tablets we've tested.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The not so powerful chipset is easy on the battery, which is of ample capacity to begin with. Another point in favor of the affordable G Pad 7.0 - its battery backup is solid, to say the least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it. If you are interested how these results compare to other tested devices, check out our battery life test result table.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 comes with a reasonable set of connectivity tools. The unit we're testing in this review is Wi-Fi-only. There's an LTE variant of the LG G Pad 7.0 that will soon be available for some regions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 (not high-speed), there's a GPS with S-GPS for faster localisation (with the help of your Wi-Fi network) but no GLONASS support, and an IR blaster that can control a TV (or other IR-supporting devices via an app). USB On-The-Go is supported. There is no wired TV-out functionality such as MHL or Slimport or a dedicated HDMI port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no FM Radio on board the LG G Pad 7.0. Finally there's a microSD card slot that supports cards of up to 32 GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has implemented its QPair app that pairs to an LG smartphone and can transfer notifications between the devices. More on that in the software part of this review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Minimalist Optimus UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Tab 7.0 is running Android 4.4.2 KitKat with the latest Optimus UI, which we saw premiere on the LG G3. Optimus UI is now more mature and has gone the flat, minimalist way with simpler, colorful round icons. The core way of navigating the UI is now much closer to stock Android and we like it the better for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick look at how Optimus UI performs and looks on the G Tab 7.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen looks similar to what we've come to expect from LG and its peers. There's a clock widget on the top along with six app shortcuts on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the ability to add widgets by swiping to the right, and you can also double tap to wake the device at any time. LG gives you a choice of four unlocking effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since this is an Android tablet you have the option to add other users to it. There three users you can add - a regular user with full rights, a restricted user for which you can select what types of apps and functions are accessible and Kids Mode user - designed to give your children access to the tablet without allowing them to pay for services and apps and mess with the system settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable more secure locks, including pattern, pin, password, or LG's own Knock Code that uses a series of taps to wake the device and unlock the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Past the lockscreen, you're greeted by the familiar Android homescreen. As on most droids, you can have multiple homescreens populated by a wide selection of apps shortcuts and widgets, and even folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation buttons are on-screen which ensures better response time and less chance of mechanical wear but also means you're effectively giving up part of your screen estate. The background behind the buttons is transparent and they obediently move out the way when you're watching a video or image so it's not that bad. Plus, the LG G Pad 7.0 lets you customize either white or black color schemes, and even add quick shortcuts for Dual window, QSlide and QMemo+, and even the notification bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's Smart Bulletin at-a-glance service isn't preinstalled on the LG G Pad 7.0 so the leftmost homescreen is just a regular homescreen pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch zoom on any homescreen lets you see them all at a glance, where you can also remove any or set default. To populate any of them, simply hold a finger on to a blank area, and drag an app or widget from the resulting screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is business as usual - a swipe down from the top bar displays a scrollable row of quick toggles, some sliders, and any notifications you may have. You can expand/collapse notifications with a two finger swipe, and dismiss them by swiping left or right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The toggles have been redesigned to fit LG's new flatter look with rounded icons with cyan accents on a black canvas. It still looks overpopulated with sliders and QSlide shortcuts, and toggles taking up around 70% of the notification area and leaving only the remaining area for the actual notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding down on a toggle in the upper row will take you to the relevant option in the settings, where you can also edit which toggles and sliders are shown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer also looks and acts the same. Aside from the usual alphabetical and chronological sorting of apps you can also rearrange the grid any way you see fit. Apps can be uninstalled directly in the app drawer, which is great for getting rid of bloatware (LG usually throws in a lot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting to the recently-opened apps is done with the dedicated on-screen button. The interface shows a list of thumbnails for each app. You can swipe them away one by one, or use the close all option. There's also a shortcut to the special Dual window feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual Window really shines on the bigger display of the LG G Pad 7.0. It allows two different apps to run simultaneously but unlike Samsung's Multi window, it doesn't allow the same instance of one app twice. There are only two apps allowed on the screen - some Samsung tablets allow up to four.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 remembers recent selections for quicker access, and lets you split the screen anywhere you want rather than the middle, top 3rd, or bottom 3rd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides Dual window, many apps have the ability to run in small resizable floating windows which LG has dubbed QSlide. QSlide applications can either be accessed from the notification area, or from within supported apps themselves by clicking the special shortcut icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Optimus UI is very useful and now offers a cleaner look. But it is still very complicated for the first-time adopter of Android, or even first-time LG users for that matter. The app drawer is filled with apps and settings, the homescreen is customizable in so many different ways - adding widgets from the app drawer or from the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But once you get to know your way around Optimus UI it will empower you to get what you want from Android. Despite having only 1 GB of RAM and the Snapdragon 400 and not 600 or 800, the LG G Pad 7.0 navigates fluidly and there are almost no hiccups or unwanted stops to speak of.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmark performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 runs on the well-know by now Snapdragon 400 chipset. It has a quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A7 processor, the Adreno 305 graphics chip and a lowly 1 GB of RAM. The whole package doesn't spell exciting performance but coupled with Android KitKat 4.4.2, it should be snappy and fluid enough for an enjoyable experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at some benchmark scores and compare the G Pad 7.0 with some of its peers - among them some that are more powerful. As a disclaimer - we tested the G Pad 7.0 for cheating on these benchmarks and found the results to show no shenanigans whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Onward with the tests. GeekBench 3 is a cross-platform benchmark that focuses on CPU performance. Basemark OS II is an all-round benchmark but one that also puts emphasis on CPU evaluation. The LG G Pad 7.0 posted an okay score in both tests. If you want to look at the breakdown between the single-core and multi-core performance you can find it below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In such high-class company, the G Tab wasn't able to nudge higher than the last spot in the table but that doesn't mean that it's a slouch, just that its rivals are among the best in business.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Adreno 305 really isn't suited for heavy gaming but it does handle the user interface well and can more than handle regular games like Cut the Rope or Where's my water. Our GPU benchmarks tend to be very brutal and it shows in the results - Basemark X gave the G Pad 7.0 a very low score, while the only GFXBench that ran was the on-screen Manhattan test - the LG G Pad 7.0 scored an unplayable 3.8 fps.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Browsing has always been a major part of a tablet's forte. We test for HTML 5 and JavaScript via Rightware's BrowserMark 2.1 and Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 tests. In Kraken 1.1 the G Pad scored a poor score. HTML 5 on the G Pad 7.0 is much better - the slate scored close to the Galaxy Tab S heavy-weights.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Whichever way you look at it, the LG G Pad 7.0 isn't a race horse of a device. But as we've said more than once the synthetic benchmarks are only there to translate hardware into performance and numbers. In real, practical usage, the G Pad 7.0 is smooth and handles tasks without hassle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it won't do is play insanely high-quality 3D games or load a page as fast as the fastest tablet on the market. But that doesn't mean it won't allow you to play games or browse the web.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 isn't call enabled as there is no SIM inside. But it will allow you to manage your Google contacts through the Phonebook app. It has a split-screen view mode with the list of contacts on the left side and the contact details for the select person in the right pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can edit contacts, add a variety of field to each person and add and edit groups of contacts, such as Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't call contacts but the G Pad 7.0 will enable you to write and email or check out a linked address on Google Maps and just about any other thing that doesn't require a cellular network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the LG G Pad 7.0 and it got a good mark. You can find out more about our loudspeaker test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the LG Mail app. The latter has the added benefit of merging all your email accounts into a single interface with a unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It does lack in the design department, though. Gmail looks much more appealing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG offers a wide array of typing methods, including split keyboard, voice recognition and Path input, LG's take on Swype.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the added ability to raise and lower the keyboard to get more or less gaps between the keys. There's also a boatload of customization options, including a dark-toned keyboard, vibration when pressing a key, character bubbles on keypress, to name a few. LG can even update its word suggestion library, if you have the option enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can always go and install a third party keyboard but the provided LG one is among the best, most functional we've seen on a slate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery stacks photos and videos together in albums, which can be organized by the date they were taken or the source they come from. Location-based sorting is also available, or you can have the Gallery display just your videos - especially useful as the G Pad 7.0 doesn't come with a dedicated Video player app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there is an array of available options at your disposal. You can share, highlight, and delete images, as well as set them as backgrounds, assign them to contacts, add them to a specific album, or print them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing images takes you to Google's Photos app, used in lieu of a picture editor from LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports viewing your images in their full resolution. You can easily pinch-zoom to 1:1 magnification and beyond.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the LG G Pad 7.0 is basically a view-only-videos setting of the Gallery app. Controls-wise you get Play/Pause, fast-forward, and rewind buttons, in addition to a slider to scrub through the video. Scrubbing through the video doesn't give you the animated preview that we saw on the LG G3 and there are now captions either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos support subtitles and you hand pick the one you want. QSlide is also supported for the video player - you can pop out a video to watch as an overlay to any other screen on the G Pad 7.0, adjust the size of the pop up window and also its opacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 played most of the files we threw at it. It didn't manage to output audio when we played AC-3 and DTS audio codecs in video and played to load MKV, MOV, WMV and FLV videos, AAC audio coding was fine along with MP3 and FLAC. AVI, MP4, MPG, DivX and Xvid videos weren't an issue for the tablet. 1080p was the maximum resolution at which it managed to play files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some files were jittery with a couple of lost frames but mostly things played smooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG's music player on the G Pad 7.0 looks and operates the same as its counterpart on the LG G3. Your music library is organized by various categories, with the Album view being the most interesting thanks to its large album thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen will display the Album art and playback controls, which you can swipe to the sides for the next/previous track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a robust equalizer on board, complete with a wide variety of presets. You can also adjust the playback pitch and speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When playing a song, playback controls will appear in the notification center and lockscreen, although on the latter the album art is rather unpleasantly stretched.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is nicely clean, but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 showed it's capable of producing nicely clean audio output in our test. The tablet posted some excellent scores in both parts of our test, suggesting that all tracks it handles will sound just the way they were meant to do. Its stereo crosstalk with headphones attached was particularly impressive and one of the best we've ever seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the volume levels of the slate left a lot to be desired. The LG G Pad 7.0 was below average when plugged into an active external amplifier and downright quiet when used with a pair of headphones. We are used to seeing smartphones do better than this and tablets are usually way louder, so we can't give full marks here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera app on the LG G Pad 7.0 also derives from the recent G3 but lacks some features due to its less-capable imaging hardware. That includes a 3.15 MP snapper on the back, complimented by a 1.3 MP snapper on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Options are very scarce - you can say cheese to capture a photo, enable grid view, a timer and geo-tag your images but that's about it - there's no HDR, no filters, no other shooting modes - just a shutter and you're done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera allows you to capture a selfie using the front-facing camera by placing your hand in front of the lens and making a fist. This will activate a 3 second timer and then capture a photo. The option is nice to have but it worked around 60% of the time and made us look a little idiotic to surrounding people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for the actual quality of the images. The LG G Pad 7.0 is first and foremost a budget tablet. And the imaging department is one of those on which LG has cut costs. The 3.15 MP snapper isn't very impressive in resolution and produces the image quality you'd expect from a snapper like this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved detail is okay but not very good. Colors appear a little washed out and contrast isn't impressive all around the frame. On the plus side the G Pad 7.0 images come out sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exposure and white balance are also spot in every photo we took.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Focusing was fast and so was taking pictures. At around 1-1.5 MB images aren't going to take over the 8 GB on-board storage either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We suppose the LG G Pad 7.0 is okay for the occasional snap here and there but we can't see it handling capturing a walk in the park or a concert very well. We would have preferred the back camera to be on the front so that you could enjoy better selfies and video chats.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder doesn't have its own interface - it's just part of the camera app. Next to the photo shutter there's a video one as well. Videos max out at 720p, which isn't particularly impressive in this day and age. We guess the camera sensor has limitations as the chipset is more than capable of 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample from the LG G Pad 7. The detail isn't much and we'd even go out and say that it looks lower in resolution than it actually is. Dynamic range is very poor but at least the colors have a little more pop to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Framerate was constant at 30 fps, which helps get smooth, stutter-free videos. Bitrate is okay at around 11 Mbps. Despite recording only 1 audio channel (read mono) the recording is good quality and carries a high bitrate of 153 Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched 720p@30fps sample straight off the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And just for the sake of further comparison here's the LG G Tab 7.0 in our video quality comparison tool. It does okay but really deteriorates in the low-light test.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Built-in browser and Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 7.0 comes with two preinstalled browsers. Since this is Android, you get the standard set of Google apps, including Chrome, as preinstalled, but LG has also added its own Android browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock browser packs the usual features: Incognito tabs, Bookmarks, Find in page and Desktop view. There is no Flash support. Pages can be saved locally to read offline, but videos cannot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, for a tablet, there's tab view on both browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is now the most popular browser on Android (and many a PC as well). It has some advantages over its vanilla-flavored buddy, including switching between tabs with a wide swipe from either the left or right of the top bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to your Google account, Chrome can sync what you have open on other devices (desktops, tablets) with the phone. This feature also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites and can remember passwords and login data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reduce data usage option sends web pages to be compressed on Google's web servers before loading them on the device to save data and speed up slow connections. This doesn't work for SSL-protected pages and Incognito tabs for privacy reasons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG's QMemo app, which was created as a response to Samsung's Notes application, is present on the G Pad 7.0 in the form of QMemo+. QMemo+ features a plethora of improvements, including the ability to add location and weather info to your notes, draw and add text to nearly any type of screenshot or picture, as well as share and save your notes via a wide range of media.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Utilizing the IR blaster is QRemote - it allows you to control either a TV or set-top box, or both using the slate and this software. It will guide you through a quick setup process where you select the manufacturer of your TV tech and when you're done - it's lounging time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, there's the usual array of productivity apps on the G Pad 7.0. There's the tasks app - it organizes your tasks and time and you can have multiple lists of tasks. Each task can have a reminder attached to it. The clock app has alarms, a timer, a stopwatch and the world time - nothing out of the ordinary here. The Calendar offers a variety of views - day view, week view, agenda view (where your appointments are listed one by one), a month view and a year view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator can handle easy calculations but can also go into scientific mode in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pad 7.0 is also equipped with a File Manager that divides your contend in categories - music, pictures, video among others. It supports copy, paste and move operations as well. There's also a Weather app that supports multiple locations and will display a visualization of what the weather is at your location. Finally, there's an old-school voice recorder that shows you a decibel reading, cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's own QPair app will allow you to sync notifications between your LG tablet and your LG smartphone. QMemos are also transferred between devices and you can see recent apps and setup internet to your tablet through your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use QPair to find your tablet or phone by sending a ringing signal. And while the feature is nice to be connected through QPair your phone and tablet will be close enough as is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps, Google Drive and Google Play are all preinstalled on the G Pad 7.0 and so is LG's Smart World store. It has exclusive apps, many free apps and games and also themes for the UI and keyboard. Not all content is available for every country, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall LG has equipped its G Pad tablet with all the software you'd need, perhaps a little more even. We can't think of anything more a user might want from the G Pad 7.0 in terms of productivity but you can always resort to the Google Play store if need arises.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Any way you look at the G Pad 7.0 it's hard to find much to frown at. Not much to get excited about either - after all the Nexus 7 had the exact same specs two years ago. 7-inchers have since been trying to beat Google's price without making too much compromise. Well, they're finally getting there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HD resolution on a 7" diagonal is the new entry level in tablets, at still a safe distance from Apple and with no dime-a-dozen WSVGA devices from white label manufacturers crowding the space. If you're shopping for your first tablet, the LG G Pad 7.0 is very much an option but so are a bunch of tablets from of Samsung, Acer, Asus and Huawei.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 7 inches, WXGA screens are still reasonably sharp - the low pixel density isn't as obvious as on 10-inch tablets (of which there're still quite a few around, at or around HD resolution). Great viewing angles and pleasant colors are points in favor of the G Pad 7.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then comes the chipset - Snapdragon 400 is the popular choice for midrange smartphones and is making its way into tablets as well. It's clearly a budget option and, with a single gig of RAM, you cannot expect the G Pad 7.0 to break any speed records. It is by no means a poor performer though - thanks to the optimizations of Android 4.4.2 KitKat, the G Pad 7.0 behaves quite nicely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Key test findings for the LG G Pad 7.0:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now let's see what the G Pad 7.0 is up against. Obviously we're looking at reasonably priced options but there are some in the running that cost a little extra but offer a lot more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0, being the main target, is around the same price as the LG G Pad 7.0 or a little higher depending on where you look. It matches the display of the G Pad on resolution and size but omits the IPS tech. It has the same camera resolution, battery size, IR blaster. It's basically the same device but with Samsung's TouchWiz on board and hardware keys below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Released a year ago, the Asus Memo Pad HD7 costs less than the G Pad 7.0 but will actually offer more. If you can find the Memo Pad HD7 you'll get a similar chipset with four Cortex-A7 cores, a 5MP rear camera with 1080p video and the same display down to the very last spec. It has two speakers but KitKat is in question and there's no IR port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Memo Pad HD7 16 GB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ASUS-made Google Nexus 7 (2012), which started it all two years ago can be had for much less and offers the same screen resolution and an equally good chipset. It doesn't have a camera on the back though, and there's no IR blaster either. Its successor, the 2013 Nexus 7 has stereo speakers, a more powerful chipset and a FullHD 7-inch screen. Timely software updates are a cinch. It costs around the same as the G Pad 7.0 or a little over.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Another compact tablet to boast a FHD screen, one of precious few, is the Huawei MediaPad X1. It's powered by a proprietary Kirin chipset with four A9 cores at 1.6GHz and has 2GB of RAM. That and the pixel-rich screen (323ppi) make for a power-hungry combo and the MediaPad X1 has a matching 5,000mAh battery. The high specs continue with a 13MP main camera and a 5MP front-facer. The big question mark is KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Huawei MediaPad X1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On home turf, last season's LG G Pad 8.3 has a bigger screen of higher resolution, better camera and chipset, twice as much RAM and superior build and finish. Probably the biggest appeal is LTE support if you're looking for a tablet with network connectivity. That comes at a price though. The current generation of LG tablets has the G Pad 8.0. It's more or less the same package as the G Pad 7.0 but has a bigger display, better camera and a bigger battery. It will cost a little more as well but might be an option if you're after more screen real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG G Pad 8.3 ? LG G Pad 8.0</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That bigger screen involves a bit of tradeoff though - the resolution stays the same and hence the pixel density drops with the size increase. That's actually true for the entire lineup. The G Pad series goes all the way to 10.1" but the resolution and processing power don't follow. That probably puts LG's 7-incher at the best position to compete. And there's little doubt about who it's going to mostly compete with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're shopping for an affordable compact tablet and the Nexus line is hard to get, the G Pad 7.0 and the Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 are some of the most obvious choices. Samsung is in its fourth generation now, while LG took a break from the tablet game. Judging by the G Pad 7.0 though you wouldn't tell.</paragraph>
