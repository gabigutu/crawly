			<paragraph>Sony's back in the mobile game and it brought three phones to Barcelona. The Xperia S was uncovered at CES and has now started shipping. The other two are brand new - the Xperia P and Xperia U.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both of those feature NovaThor U8500 chipsets with two 1GHz cores and Mali-400MP GPUs, while the Xperia S uses a more traditional Qualcomm Snapdragon dual-core.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also showed some PlayStation games running on the Xperia S and talked about improvements to the Xperia P display (spoiler: it's brighter).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia P<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P has a 4" Reality display with what Sony call WhiteMagic technology. It boosts the brightness of the display by using a fourth subpixel to the traditional RGB setup, namely a white pixel. This is great as older Reality displays had excellent contrast but weren?t very bright.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We stopped by the Sony booth at the MWC to find out more about this new technology and gladly found out there was a nice little set up that would allow us to test it properly. So we loaded the same image on the iPhone 4S and a Galaxy S II and placed them alongside the Xperia P. As you can see the Xperia P does better than either of its competitors both when in the shadow and in bright sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P has an aluminum unibody and features the same transparent strip as the Xperia S and it will be available in three color options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also got hold of a red Sony Xperia P unit, so we are able to show you how this one looks in real life, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia P shoots 1080p videos with its 8MP camera, thanks to the added power of the ST-Ericsson NovaThor U8500. So, in a small way Ericsson is still part of these phones. There's a microHDMI port so you can easily hook up the P to an HDTV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P has NFC connectivity, so it's compatible with Sony's Smart tags. It also has a dedicated SmartDock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia P runs on Android 2.3.7 Gingerbread skinned with the typical Sony theme you've already seen on the Xperia S and the 2011 Xperia - arc, neo and ray. An ICS upgrade is scheduled for release later this year.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia U<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia U is smaller, with a 3.5" Reality screen of FWVGA resolution. The U packs only a 5MP camera but shoots 1080p video nonetheless. It uses an Exmor R sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There will be a Smart Headset in the Xperia U box. It features in-ear plugs and tangle-free cables, plus a so-called SmartKey that can be set to launch any app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia U has an illuminated transparent strip like the others in the new Xperia line, but the color of the backlight changes to match the wallpaper color. We took some time to photograph the various colors of the transparent strip, check them out!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not just the backlight color though - the bottom plastic is interchangeable and you get a pink and yellow ones in the box if the default black one is too ordinary for you. Here's how you can exchange the plastic at the bottom:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia U also runs on Android 2.3.7 Gingerbread, but Ice Cream Sandwich is coming later this year as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also recorded a short hands-on video with the Sony Xperia U, check it out:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's the one we took right after the Sony press conference.</paragraph>
