			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart for AT&amp;T is bound to bring a massive dash of toughness to the Korean giant's Android ranks. Compliant with MIL-STD-810f military grade standard, the handset will also enable Samsung to compete in yet another smartphone segment of the already saturated U.S. market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it is no secret that Samsung's smartphone lineup in the United States is difficult to keep track of due to its sheer size, a rugged device had been a notable omission until the arrival of the subject of today's feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite being a newcomer to the U.S. market, the Samsung Rugby Smart is hardly a revolution in terms of design or specifications. What Samsung have done essentially, is put the single-core, 1.4GHz Scorpion CPU and Snapdragon chipset of the Galaxy W into the casing of the Galaxy Xcover. Add a 3.7" Super AMOLED screen to the mix and there goes the Samsung Rugby Smart for AT&amp;T. Here is the full list of key features for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can notice at its key features above, the Samsung Rugby Smart is not exactly at the cutting edge of the Android realm today. The smartphone surely is not a looker either. Instead, the handset is here to offer its potential users solid functionality, without compromising on toughness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, we are now going to kick things off with an unboxing of the Samsung Rugby Smart, followed by design, build quality, and toughness inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Rugby Smart for AT&amp;T is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Samsung Rugby Smart is quite big, but don't let it deceive you. All you are going to find inside it is a charger and a microUSB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microSD card or a pair of headphones would have definitely been a welcome sight in the device's box. Unfortunately however, AT&amp;T and Samsung think otherwise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Rugged phones are generally not the prettiest around and the Samsung Rugby Smart is not an exception. We are quite certain that not many people will fall after its looks. Thankfully, you have the military grade ruggedness to offset the far from impressive looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of ruggedness, it is time to tell you a few words about the device's special talent. The MIL-STD-810f military grade standard is a really serious accomplishment for a consumer device. The Samsung Rugby Smart can spend an hour submerged in water, along with being dust proof and seriously shock resistant. It can handle the typical accidental drops with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a video of the Samsung Rugby Smart's reaction to water. Check it out below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see above, water is no problem for the device at all. The only minor nuisance here is that the water drops sometimes interact with the screen if it is turned on, and not locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, the build quality of the smartphone is excellent. The handset is a blend of rubber-feel and hard plastic, as well as Corning Gorilla Glass on the front. It doesn't feel premium, but it is not supposed to anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The measures of the Samsung Rugby Smart are extremely pocket-friendly for a device of this type. They are 122.4 x 65.9 x 12.2 mm, while its weight tips the scale at 119 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.7" Super AMOLED screen with WVGA resolution is an old favorite of ours. Its contrast and viewing angles are superb, and a perfect fit for the outdoorsy character of the Samsung Rugby Smart. The pixel density of 252ppi is not too shabby either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, you will find the typical for all U.S. Samsung droids, four buttons. In the case of the Rugby Smart, they are hardware ones, made of textured plastic. Above the screen is where the earpiece, the front-facing camera, the ambient light and proximity sensors can be found.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is on the left side of the device. Long pressing the volume up button activates the LED camera flash on the back as a flashlight. You switch it off by long pressing the same button. The power/lock key is on the right side of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is on top of the device. It is tightly sealed by with a rubber cover. The same goes for the microUSB port at the bottom of the device. The mouthpiece is there as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the device, you will find the 5MP camera and its LED flash, the loudspeaker grille, as well as the lock for removing the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you remove the battery cover, there are no surprises. The SIM and microSD card slots are neatly tucked under the 1650mAh battery, so they are not hot swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart performed exceptionally well in our proprietary battery test. The device achieved a score of 45, which means that you will need to recharge it every 45 hours if you use it for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing, and video playback every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find out all about the battery performance of the smartphone here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rugby Smart's measures make it extremely easy to handle. Even one handed operation of the handset is a breeze - an rare occasion with the ever increasing screen size of the latest Android smartphones. The device is grippy and not prone to accidental drops - not that you have to worry about them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we found nothing to frown about the design and build quality of the Samsung Rugby Smart. The device is built strictly with ruggedness in mind, so good looks and upmarket feel are missing. The ergonomics however are top notch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are now going to take a closer look at the software of the handset, as well as its performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Android Gingerbread and TouchWiz 4.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart runs Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread with Samsung's TouchWiz launcher out of the box. The experience which the device offers is practically the same as every top shelf Samsung smartphone on the market today. Check it out in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen holds no surprises. It can be swiped away in any direction. The cool feature where missed events (messages, calls etc) get their own unlock patterns is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen accommodates tons of widgets with lots of functionality. You can have up to 7 homescreens. A pinch zoom brings you to an aggregate view of all homescreen panes, which can be edited: rearranged, deleted or added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets, shortcuts or folders are pulled onto the homescreen from a drawer that appears at the bottom of the screen once you enter edit mode (press and hold on an empty spot or do Menu &gt; Add).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panels serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is very similar to the homescreen - you can create folders to go with your shortcuts and you can add, remove and rearrange pages just like you would homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose List view instead of the regular grid view if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In typical TouchWiz fashion, there are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the screen that are visible both on the homescreen and in the app launcher. You can swap the first three with different ones (by default the shortcuts are Phone, Contacts, Messaging), the fourth one being locked. It's the app drawer/home shortcut so it makes sense to always keep it in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly remodeled in TouchWiz 4.0, but there aren't any major changes to the functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom task manager, which Samsung have preinstalled, offers a lot of functionality. It also comes with a handy widget which shows you the number of active applications right on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart comes with a modest amount of preinstalled AT&amp;T apps. Thankfully, most of them can be removed out of the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This should hardly come as surprise - the Samsung Rugby Smart's benchmark scores are identical to the ones we saw on the Samsung Galaxy W. As you probably know, the two devices share the same CPU, chipset, as well as RAM memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having that in mind, the device did quite well for a single-core handset. Here are some of the results for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device's real life performance was faultless. Despite its aged hardware, the Samsung Rugby Smart handled all tasks with ease and no lag whatsoever.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is as good as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you've created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The TouchWiz-specific swiping gesture is here too - swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - a tap adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your Facebook or LinkedIn account. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard - one displays the person's contact information the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff - status updates and the contact's online galleries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weirdly, only Facebook and LinkedIn contacts can be synced with the phonebook - we usually see Twitter contacts in here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top notch telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart had no issues with reception even in areas with poor coverage. Sound in the earpiece was crisp and fairly loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each in a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm - it searches names and numbers simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only one contact (with contact photo) is shown at a time in the Smart Dial suggestions. You can tap the down arrow to view the rest (a digit above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is among the best in business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers a combined inbox option, which color-codes emails from different accounts so it's easy to tell which email was pulled from which account. Conversation view is also available - it groups related emails into single entries with a number in parenthesis showing the number of emails grouped. A tap on that entry expands it to show a list of the individual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts. Video chat support is also on board here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text entry goes, you have the standard Samsung keyboard at your disposal, as well as Swype and the standard Gingerbread keyboard. All are fairly comfortable, although if you're coming from a bigger screen, the keys might feel a little cramped. The landscape keyboard should be good enough though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery, photo editor, and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically compiles the images and videos no matter in which folder they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you. It displays full resolution images and supports double tap and pinch zoom. It supports sharing images over Bluetooth, email, messaging along with uploading to Picasa or using DLNA to push the image to a compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get an image editor preinstalled. It handles the basics like image rotation, cropping (no resize though) and adjusting brightness/saturation/contrast. You can also make selections (using a smart tool similar to the Quick selection tool in Photoshop). It's not nearly as accurate as the Photoshop tool though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can apply effects too but the one feature that caught our eye was Context fill - similar to Photoshop's Context-aware fill tool although, not nearly as accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but efficient file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A TouchWiz-ed music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung have enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, tracks are sorted into four categories - All, Playlists, Albums and Artists. From the settings, you can add or remove categories to set up the music player just the way you like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art has a central place in the Now Playing interface, but you can replace it with an equalizer. You can skip songs or FF/rewind by sideways swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A nice video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There's 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitle sync (time them back or forth) but there's no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>A solid 5MP shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart comes with a 5MP camera and an LED flash. It captures photos at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its interface looks pretty familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, you get the front/back camera switch and the flash control. You can replace those two and add two more (for a total of four) shortcuts to any option in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the photos, taken with the camera is great. Image detail is clean and naturally looking even at pixel level. Colors and white balance are good too. Check out a few samples below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording could have been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera. You get the same customizable panel on the left with four shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera shoots 720p video at 30fps. Unlike the still camera, you can't use the video-call camera to shoot videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are shot in .MP4 with the nice sounding bitrate of 12Mbps. The videos themselves are with average quality as we noticed a lot of jaggies on diagonal lines. Detail is also far from impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 720p video sample for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes an untouched 720p@30fps video clip for download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is well covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and dual-band 3G with HSPA+ (14.4 Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Bluetooth 3.0 for fast local file transfers. Then there's Wi-Fi b/g/n support and a Wi-Fi hotspot option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from various devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset also comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects to the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you a URL to type into your computer's web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone - from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who's connected to the phone at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A solid web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed. Its user experience is, as usual, quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, and find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another neat trick is the browser-specific brightness setting. You can, for example, boost the brightness in the browser to comfortably view your web pages but keep the general brightness low to conserve battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Flash 11 support, which means you can watch YouTube videos right in the browser (videos up to 720p worked smoothly) and play Flash games too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There is a document editor at your service<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart comes with the Quickoffice preinstalled. It's one of the most feature-rich mobile editors around. You can view, edit and create Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents (Office 2003 and Office 2007 are supported) and there's a PDF viewer as well. The app enables searching your office files just like in a file explorer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer with a ton of options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has five different types of view: list, daily, weekly, monthly and annually. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view (often referred to as Agenda view) shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It's a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. Turning the phone landscape reveals more advanced calculator functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart features a decent alarm clock application with a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a To-Do app called Task and a Voice recorder to round off the organizer functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app now uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. It will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version also supports indoor navigation for popular shopping destinations and airports across America. It is still in Beta though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart has the latest version of the Android Market. Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a lot to like in the Samsung Rugby Smart. The smartphone is tough, yet extremely pocketable. Its Super AMOLED screen is perfect for outdoor activities, and the battery performs really well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side of things, there are no complaints either. TouchWiz 4.0 provides one of the best Android Gingerbread experiences around. Sadly, we can't tell you if Ice Cream Sandwich will make it to the device though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the hardware of the device could have been a lot better - an extra CPU core would have made the device a lot more future proof. The same goes for its looks and retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Rugby Smart's retail price is $99.99 with a two-year commitment on AT&amp;T. You can easily find a dual-core Android device for this kind of cash. None of the options however, will be even remotely close to the Rugby Smart in terms of ruggedness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of rugged devices, the only alternative to the Samsung Rugby Smart, which is officially offered by a wireless carrier, is the Casio G'zOne Commando for Verizon Wireless. Curiously enough, the smartphone offers an ancient spec sheet, combined with far from great design, to go with a higher price tag. Unless you are a die-hard fan of the brand, or someone forced you into it, we suggest that you stick with the Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Casio G'zOne Commando</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also take a look at the Sony Ericsson Xperia active and Motorola Defy+. Both devices can be purchased commitment free for around $350, depending on the online seller of tour choosing. Keep in mind however, that the Samsung offering is better specc'd than both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Xperia active ? Motorola DEFY+</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have brought the Rugby Smart to the market with the clear knowledge that it won't sell in millions. As a niche product however, the handset is easily the best in its class at the moment - a fact, which will certainly help the device find its followers.</paragraph>
