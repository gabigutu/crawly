		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Raise your hand everybody who at any point these past few months wanted an Xperia arc. Whoa, not bad. Hardly a surprise though. Who wouldn't want it? The Xperia arc is pure class, a daring display of skill and style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, you might just want to keep those hands up. Cause the Xperia arc keeps on coming. Nothing wrong with Sony Ericsson wanting you to continue to want their top droid. They had more than one way to go about it. Obviously, a price drop wasn't one of them. A facelift? Maybe, if it were any other phone. It's the Xperia arc though and we need to show some respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, seven months later, Sony Ericsson proceed with the upgrade. An overclocked processor, the latest Android release and some new paint jobs - this is not an upgrade that makes the original obsolete. It's an upgrade nonetheless and we'll treat it as one until proven otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s take a look at an already familiar feature set, shall we?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the specs, the question forces itself on us. Was this necessary? If you already own the Xperia arc, the answer is clearly no. But the Xperia arc S is not for people like you anyway. It isn't its goal to send the company's flagship into retirement. Nor was it forced upon the company by the circumstances. Like the Xperia neo V had to fill in for the original Xperia neo, because of the 8 megapixel sensor shortage after the devastating Japan earthquake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia arc S has more to do with publicity rather than adding value. Sony Ericsson are right to want their flagship back into the spotlight. That's what the new version does. Never mind that the familiar deal-breakers are still here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be fair though, the Xperia arc S comes with Android 2.3.4 out of the box, which the previous Xperia phones released in 2011, will be getting later on. The 2.3.4 update brings some good new stuff:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk with Video Chat is part of the package too but you won't be able to enjoy it on the Xperia arc S, which doesn't have a front-mounted camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, comparison is not the point. The Xperia arc S is not supposed to better the original Xperia arc. It's not improvement that Sony Ericsson were after, it's repetition. It's been a while since they last had a winner like the Xperia arc. When you do, you want people to know about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, there'll be plenty of repetition in our review but we can't help it. But still, we guess you're as eager as we are to know how much faster and better the Xperia arc S actually is. Follow us on the next page where the action starts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well accessorized<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S comes in a compact box accommodating the handset itself as well as a few standard-issue accessories. Those include a USB charger, a microUSB-to-USB cable (used for charging and computer connections), a charger head and an in-ear headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A leather carrying case and an 8GB mircoSD card are supplied too. There was no HDMI cable in our box, but as with the original Xperia arc, package contents must be a region-specific thing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Do we need to say it again? The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S is the same phone as the original Xperia arc. At 125 x 63 x 8.7 mm, it's the same size and the same elegant appearance. The Xperia arc S comes with different paintjobs but is still made of plastic, hence the exact same weight of 117 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reality display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 4.2? 16M-color LCD screen of the Xperia arc S has FWVGA resolution (854 x 480 pixels). It?s a capacitive touchscreen and we had no issues with response. As you would expect in a modern day smartphone, multi-touch input is enabled too so there?s nothing to worry about in terms of physical interaction with the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key feature of the Reality displays is the Sony Bravia Mobile Engine, which in our original Xperia arc review, we found to be more than just a marketing gimmick. You can find out more about how it improves the image quality by boosting contrast and sharpness here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewed at the proper angle the Reality display is among the best screens on the market. It?s got more vibrant reds and greens than the iPhone 4's Retina display. Some people will probably prefer it over the Samsung SuperAMOLED screens too, which tend to oversaturate. We still find Nokia?s ClearBlack screens though to be the champion in color rendering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those observations were confirmed by our contrast test, which the Xperia arc S passed with flying colors. The contrast of its 4.2? screen topped our charts, even though its brightness fell slightly short of the iPhone 4 result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, an LCD unit is unable to match the deep black contrast of an AMOLED screen, but given that limitations Sony Ericsson has done an excellent job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reality screen?s Achilles? heel is viewing angles. The advantage it holds against the competition quickly disappears as you tilt to wider viewing angles. The text on screen might remain visible but contrast degrades very quickly and colors get vastly distorted. It?s an unpleasant effect that you cannot see with the IPS matrix of the iPhone 4 or the two current best AMOLED technologies (ClearBlack and SuperAMOLED).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia arc S is a beautiful phone: tall, super slim, that subtle curve adding extra style. And the handset looks dazzling in white. We have the black version too but it's nowhere near the exquisite feel and compelling presence of a white clad Xperia arc S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy surfaces of the black arc S are easily covered in smudges and the phone quickly loses its appeal. Your black phone will certainly require extra care to keep its great looks. The white one doesn't have to worry about that. It surely gets the same amount of grease, but you can't see it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S display we find the usual three Android controls - a Back button, a Home key that brings up the task switcher upon a long press and a Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three keys we mentioned are all well-defined, so even if a bit thin, they?re unlikely to pose a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the proximity and ambient light sensor, a status LED and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Xperia arc S holds the 3.5mm standard audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock key and the microHDMI port are at the top of the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S. The power key is too small to be comfortable, though being slightly raised helps a bit. It certainly takes some time getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is in the top right corner with a status LED above. The thin volume rocker is below and the miniscule camera key is all the way at the bottom. It is too small and placed too close to the corner. If Sony Ericsson were to redesign anything on the original Xperia arc, the shutter key would've been a solid candidate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The location of the 8 megapixel camera lens on the back is also the same as before - too close to the edge and extremely likely to get covered by a finger when holding the handset in a position to shoot. You have to be extremely careful not to ruin your shots. That?s a problem with the iPhone 4 too, by the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill is the other thing to note at the back. It?s placed on the other end of the rear panel and due to the phone?s curved design it won?t get muffed too easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the non-hot-swappable microSD slot, the SIM compartment and the second microphone pinhole, used for active noise cancelation during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is a 1500 mAh unit that is said to last up to 460 hours of stand-by or up to 7 hours and 25 minutes of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, we managed to squeeze just over two days of moderate-to-heavy use (a few calls, an hour of browsing and per day, along with the usual imaging and sound tests).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In conclusion, the Xperia arc S does well to stay true to the original. After all, the Xperia arc is one of the least likely phones to need a facelift anytime soon. Some usability compromises had to be made for the phone to look as impressive as it does. The tiny shutter key and the camera lens location don't quite make sense in a phone of otherwise brilliant imaging credentials. The non-hot-swappable microSD card and the placement of the connectivity ports high at the sides are other things to consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inward curve is a bold design decision. Subtle but compelling, it's what gives the handset its classy and sophisticated look. Not as comfortable to hold as the Sony Ericsson phones using the human curvature design (outward curve), the phone has style and elegance to spare.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface - Android 2.3.4 takes over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S is the company's first smartphone to come with the latest Android 2.3.4. We already mentioned some of the new features available and we'll cover them again. Deep inside though, it's basically the same Timescape-skinned Gingerbread that we have in the latest Xperia lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a video of the user interface in action, which is a good starting point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the Xperia arc S has a five pane homescreen (you can't add or delete panes), with four docked shortcuts (two on either side of the launcher shortcut). Those are visible on all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen also does a neat trick called Overview mode. Pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition. All your widgets gather there and you can click the one you want and go to its screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of functionality, it?s similar to the HTC Leap view or what Samsung do in TouchWiz. However widgets here are not crammed in small hard-to-read screens. Instead, they?re all shuffled on a single screen, so they can better use the space and remain as big as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia arc S has some custom-made Sony Ericsson widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, the standard gallery is back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher puts shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort your icons within the grid. You can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually shuffle the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is simple, using the iOS logic (and visual layout). You drag one icon over another and a pop-up prompts you to select an icon and a name for the folder you?re about to set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is standard Xperia fare. Which means you get notifications for Facebook events too. The standard notification area and task switcher are of course present and accounted for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll explain thoroughly the Facebook integration later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing worth mentioning - the Take Screenshot shortcut. It's found in the power settings and you need to press and hold on the Power/Lock key to access it. It would have been better if Sony Ericsson has made it with a combination of two keys (like the iOS's Home+Lock combo) rather than a virtual shortcut, but at least it's there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon chipset has been around for a while and we know what to expect from it in terms of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson already used this chipset in several of their phones, but the Xperia arc S is the first one with a 1.4GHz-clocked processor. As we suspected the Xperia arc S showed better results on the synthetic benchmarks - between 20% and 30% higher than the latest Xperia ray smartphone. The video benchmarks are on par though, since both handsets use the same GPU - Adreno 205.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Facebook-powered phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia arc S visually customized phonebook can store extensive information about all your contacts. Info for each contact is presented in side-swipable interface that holds contact info, recent calls and more info from social networking services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options ? a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts, or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can ?join? their contact info to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled ? a tap on the contact?s photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the plus and X buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write down the name phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Personalized ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No smart dialing, but good telephony anyway<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia arc S held on to signal well and we didn?t experience dropped calls. Reception levels are good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Xperia arc S as every other Xperia phone does not support smart dialing. There?s voice dialing though (the quickest way to activate it is the dedicated homescreen widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S automatically disables the touchscreen when you hold it next to your ear during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S. Scoring an Average result, the arc S isn't the loudest ringer around, so you might occasionally miss a call. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hidden in the Sound settings is xLOUD, a feature that claims to improve speaker loudness. A quick test shows deeper sound, but we also used our digital noise/loudness meter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>xLOUD made a difference of about 3dB when you sum up the tests, pushing the score to a Good mark, but it's still a minor gap to made a noticeable difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Swipe input boosts the messaging further<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads. Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (against deletion).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use search to locate a specific message in all conversations. You can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there?s no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email app can do that however. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A preview pane splits the screen in half - one side lists the emails, while the other shows the currently selected email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This works both in portrait and landscape and you can easily drag the separator between the two areas to make one bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the arc S offers a just the default (Gingerbread) on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Even on the portrait keyboard, typing is pretty comfortable, keys are large enough and well spaced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape however tells a whole new story. The large on-screen keyboard takes more than half the screen and gives you large, easy to press buttons. The arc S is probably as good as you will ever need ? in virtual keyboard terms of course. For proper typing, you should consider a QWERTY messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a ?handle? attached to the text cursor ? it?s easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A tap and hold will bring up the select options ? select word and select all ? with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection. Another tap and hold brings up the copy/cut options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now about the T9 Trace swipe input. It works the same way as the Swype we already met in lots of Galaxy phones - instead of tapping on keys you sweep a finger across the keyboard. Even if you never used Swype input before, you'll get used to it fast and embrace it. There is also setting for automatically put Space between the words, so you don't need to every time you "swipe" a word.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, why not Swype, but swipe or trace. It works the same way both in usability and precision, so you shouldn't really care about the name.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia arc S uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn?t really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should have noticed the 3D switch by now at the top. It opens a different gallery section that stores only your 3D panorama shots. The standard camera photos and panoramas are in the familiar camera folder in the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To view the 3D panoramas, you need to connect your phone to a compatible 3DTV. We tried them on the LG Optimus 3D, but the device couldn?t recognize them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has added support for Facebook albums too. They are distinguished by the small Facebook logo on them and when viewing individual pics from that album, you can "like" them with the thumbs up button in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Thanks to the Xperia arc S multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS also comes in handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors, as it sharpens the image and reduces noise. These steps would normally lead to artifacts, but the high-density screen of the Xperia arc S makes them invisible. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend you keep it on - it really improves the image quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HD video playback, poor codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Xperia arc S as in most of the droids out there. Fair enough, maybe a fancy UI for picking a video is not that important, playing videos is what really counts. Well, that?s another disappointment ? the video player supports only 3GP and MP4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To its credit, the Xperia arc S did play a 720p MP4 video (but not 1080p). And the 4.3? FWVGA Reality screen offers excellent image quality (the BRAVIA engine comes into play here too) and spot-on aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you re-encode your videos before hand, the Xperia arc S can make a good PMP. Or you could just download a capable video player off the Android Market and make your life easier. This would address other deficiencies of the Xperia arc S video player, like lack of subtitles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player has Facebook likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Xperia arc S is the same app you get in the ray and the Xperia neo. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you?ll get a search shortcut, as well as send and delete options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library and the Infinite key. The latter lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the rich selection of equalizer presets. You also get Silent mode, which mutes all other sounds except for alarms - great for uninterrupted listening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Gallery, the Music player on the Xperia arc S lets you "like" tracks you're listening to, which posts it on your wall. Later on, you can discuss them with your friends through the Friends' music and videos app (sometimes called Media discovery). There's a widget too, so you can always be up to date with what you're friends are listening to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS, there is TrackID too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station. Or you can mark some of them as favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service is also available and works within the radio app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nicely clean audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To say that the Sony Ericssno Xperia Arc S has similar audio output to its predecessor would be quite an understatement. In fact we are confident that not a sinlge element of the smartphone audio engine was modified in any way when the Arc got its new brains. We are not compaining, mind you. The Arc had pretty nice audio quality and the Arc S is just as good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an active external amplifier you are getting some really impressive scores. In that case the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S is reasonably loud and there's not a single result that's anything but excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play there's some degradation here and there, most notably with stereo crosstalk and distortion levels. Still those are no worse than average and with the other scores pretty good, we'd give the Arc S very good mark on the second test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixel camera offers Sweep Panorama<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia arc S boasts an 8 megapixel camera, complete with a single LED light. Much like the Xperia ray and arc, the Xperia arc S uses an backlit Exmor R sensor, which promises improved low-light performance. Our experience with these sort of sensors is that they indeed offer lowered noise levels but the improvement is nothing that major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera controls on the Xperia arc S are available on two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. The left one holds five shortcuts to various settings, while the right one shows thumbnails of the five most recent photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pull to expand the settings taskbars or push them out of sight. It?s a clever solution that lets you pick how much of the camera controls are seen in the viewfinder. The shortcuts in the left column can be rearranged and you can replace some of them with others from the extended menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between five capture modes - Normal, Scene recognition, Smile detection, Sweep Panorama and 3D Sweep Panorama. In Normal, you pick the Scene settings manually or you can enable Scene recognition and let the Xperia arc S take a guess (it's fairly good at it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two panorama modes are the additions brought by the Android 2.3.4. The Sweep Panorama option is available in lots of Sony portable cameras, so it should be familiar to some of you. Anyway, it?s very easy to take a panorama - you just follow an on-screen slider until you reach the end and your panorama shot is taken. Unfortunately you can't choose how long it will be, you have to shoot it until the slider run out. If you are too slow or too fast you'll have to start over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on which panorama mode you have chosen, you will be able either to view your 2D shot (4912x1080 pixels) on your arc S or take it on a 3D TV and see it there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other settings include changing the resolution, toggling between front/back camera, photo light (but it's switched manually, not automatically as a flash), geotagging, image stabilization and focus mode. Also at your disposal are a self-timer, shutter sound, exposure, white balance and metering settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is good - comparable to that of the neo and the ray and it's tuned slightly differently than the first arc (the S model offers more accurate color rendering). Noise levels are kept relatively low but there is some color noise. Photos have good contrast and good (though slightly oversaturated) colors. The amount of captured detail isn't among the best in the 8MP league however. Purple fringing and oversharpening are evident in high-contrast areas, but nothing drastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another downside of the camera is that it overexposes shots, especially when there are a lot of shadows in the scene. On the upside, the Xperia arc S manages to keep some detail in those shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panorama shots are captured with 4912x1080 pixels resolution and if you take them with a tripod they will be assembled perfectly. If not, you'll be surprised to out the pictures are almost as good as tripod enhanced ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the pano shots suffer from everything the standard ones do - lack of detail, over sharpening and are overexposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped a couple of shots in poor lighting so you can probably see the high ISO result for yourself</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S to our Photo Compare database. The tool?s page has a quick how to guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia arc S performed very well on all the three charts, producing enough amount of detail and pleasant colors. We saw some fringing in high-contrast areas again. It seems the Xperia arc S performs a lot better when is put and stabilized on a tripod within a studio environment, rather than outside.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good 720p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S captures 720p video at 30 fps and does a very good job of it. The camcorder has similar settings to the still camera - focus mode, metering, exposure value and image stabilization are all user-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arc S camcorder joins the select few with continuous autofocus. It may take a few seconds to refocus after you re-frame but that's better than repeating attempts to lock focus that may ruin a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 format (6Mbps bitrate) and the frame rate nails the 30fps mark. The amount of captured detail is very good and so are the colors (though they're slightly oversaturated again). Contrast is good too. The still camera defects (purple fringing, oversharpening) are not present here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amount of detail drops a bit in the dark as noise reduction fights to keep videos mostly noise free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arc S videos come with stereo sound recorded at 128Kbps bitrate and 48kHz samplong.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We entered the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 720p mobile camcorders. You'll find it a good match or even superior for the latest Gingerbread running HTC and Samsung single-core droids.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity welcomes USB OTG, but requires a dock to work<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S has a good deal of connectivity options. The basics are covered by quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload at 5.76 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n) and Bluetooth 2.1 for wireless local connectivity. The Connected devices app turns your Xperia arc S into a DLNA server, letting you view media on DLNA-enabled devices (e.g. TV, PlayStation 3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB v2.0 port handles both wired data transfer and charging. With the Android 2.3.4 Xperia arc S supports USB on-the-go, but you have to buy the Sony Ericsson Live Dock to be able to use it. When you get the accessory, you can connect USB Flash drives, keyboard and mouse to your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LiveWare manager app lets you assign specific apps to be launched when a given accessory is connected, which can be quite handy (e.g. launch music player when you plug in headphones or a file browser for flash memory).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inbuilt storage has 300MB only available to the user, but you can expand it up to 32GB via the microSD card slot. The phone will ship with an 8GB memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A standard 3.5mm audio jack and a micro HDMI port complete the connectivity tally. There is no micro HDMI cable included in the retail box, but usually is a market dependent feature.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The perfect web browsing experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the browser is simple, with almost no visible chrome by default. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way you have the entire 4.2? screen for web browsing. The arc S browser supports double tap and pinch zooming, along with the dedicated virtual zoom buttons. There's text reflow, which reformats text so that it best fits on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsing performance is excellent - panning, zooming and the text reflow are blazing fast. The arc S web browser is an example of how a mobile browser should look and behave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the important features in the web browser is the full Flash 11 support. YouTube videos played smoothly at 360p, 480p and even 720p - no dropped frames, audio lag or video artifacts. It seems the new Flash 11 combined with the faster processor are working perfectly together. Flash games played trouble free too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable on the high-resolution screen and panning is blazing fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with both Gmail and the generic email app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. The generic Email app even lets you download the attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for Agenda: a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Events appear just like regular events but you can't edit them from the phone, they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can pull out advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms) from the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you don?t have the Stopwatch, Timer or World Clock options. You don?t get a Voice Recorder either. There's plenty of those in the Android Market though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Wisepilot navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S comes with a GPS receiver, which took less than 4 minutes to get satellite lock from a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks or the network positioning if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our unit came with Maps 5.1 out of the box, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without a connection though. There are also 3D buildings, two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, those features aren?t available everywhere. 3D buildings are available mostly in the biggest world cities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street view is, as usual, a part of the standard package - it gives you a panoramic view of every bit of road in the covered areas. With the compass mode enabled, it feels like a virtual tour of the place!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Xperia acr S came with Wisepilot pre-installed with full navigation license. It took it really long to get a GPS lock with every GPS setting turned on, but then it does what a SatNav software is supposed to - navigate (with voice guidenace). There are weather and traffic information too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We just can't promise you your arc S will also come with the same Wisepilot license, it may be a market-dependent.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market gets a new look<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia arc S runs the latest version of Android and has a FWVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market. The MSM8255 chipset should be able to handle most apps in there too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market had another visual boost lately plus a layout redesign. Now you get a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. This organization reminds a lot of the Apple's App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-app section is untouched though and we still find it quite unattractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We guess we made a point already that the Xperia arc S is not an upgrade. At least not in the sense of making the previous version redundant. So what's it then? A quiet coup at the top? Nah, we doubt it. You can't do that to a phone like the Xperia Arc. In fact, someone at Sony Ericsson must still love the original Arc. Love it the way Samsung love their Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, releasing as many sequels as Samsung wouldn't be a wise thing to do. But keeping your flagship up to date certainly is. When the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S had to make way for the I9001 Galaxy S Plus, there was a change of chipsets involved. In the case of the Xperia arc S, it's simply a matter of clock speed. OK, maybe not as simple as we make it sound - otherwise the original Arc would've had the faster CPU to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The important thing anyway is that the arc S brings a welcome speed boost. Not one perhaps that was desperately needed but welcome anyway. You don?t want your finest humiliated by competitors with better hardware. That?s no way to treat a flagship and Sony Ericsson knew it. They needed a match for the latest single-core droids and they got it in the arc S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may be a small thing like playing HD Flash videos in the browser hassle-free but it's subtle details that make the difference in user experience. Thanks to the faster processor and the new Android release the Xperia arc S has better overall handling and the benchmarks are here to prove it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, in the end the Xperia arc S is Sony Ericsson's answer to the likes of the HTC Sensation XL and Samsung's Galaxy S Plus, Galaxy W and Wave 3. The price is more than reasonable too: at launch the sequel costs nearly as much the original Arc, so not too hard to guess where to put your money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung's Galaxy S Plus with a Super AMOLED screen and Galaxy W (LCD) are using the same chipset as the Xperia arc S and run Android Gingerbread, but fail to match the level of sophistication and the superior imaging capabilities of the arc S. Still if you need to save ?50 or so, both phones are a good way to do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus ? Samsung galaxy W I8150</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently announced HTC Sensation XL brings more features and screen estate, but will surely cost quite a bit extra when it's released. It probably tops the single-core food chain today, so if you want the best there is, you should check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Sensation XL</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bada OS 2.0-powered Samsung Wave 3 is also a nice option with its Super AMOLED screen, metal on the body and a gentler price tag. The OS may have less clout than Android but there are some good-looking phones running it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8600 Wave 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S is right on schedule. Well, obviously not even remotely on time if you consider all the dual core handsets around. But the timing is right if you're Sony Ericsson looking to boost interest in your flagship. It comes in handy too for users still having second thoughts about buying the original Xperia Arc. A price drop is what often puts ex-flagships, however briefly, back into the spotlight. The Sony Ericsson arc S says no to price drops, and tries a speed boost instead. We don't see why it won't work.</paragraph>
