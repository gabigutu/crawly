			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG couldn't wait for the IFA expo to kick off and announced its upcoming devices weeks in advance. The affordable LG Bello and Fino, plus the LG G3 Stylus were made official in August, while the circular G Watch R smartwatch caught the spotlight a few days before the scheduled press events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We knew the newcomers specs, but the real life look and performance called for a visit of the LG's booth at IFA in Berlin, where we were lucky to spend some quality time with all those cool gadgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>First we tried the LG G3 Stylus, a different take on the G3 flagship with trimmed-down screen and chipset, but with a metal chassis and a stylus, as the name suggests. Is it as good as the Samsung's S-Pen? We'll see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, we skipped straight to the amazing G Watch R. Just when we thought Motorola had it all figured out, along came LG announcing the G Watch R - a massive threat for the coming soon Moto 360.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, we checked out the midrangers Bello and Fino - KitKat-powered droids with WVGA displays, quad-core processors and 8MP cameras. Intrigued? Let's get on with it, shall we?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G3 Stylus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 Stylus takes after the flagship, but the similarities are skin-deep - the internals are completely different. Despite using the popular high-end G3 design with metal chassis and brushed aluminum-like plastic rear, the G3 Stylus is a much more affordable midrange smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G3 Stylus packs a 5.5" IPS display of qHD resolution, and while the colors are good, the low 200ppi takes its toll. You can see the individual pixels, the contrast is below average and the brightness is low as well, while with those viewing angles you wouldn't have to worry about your privacy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire front is mostly occupied by the massive display with on-screen controls. The rear panel has LG's innovative control deck below the 13MP camera - a Power/Lock button set within the volume keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic stylus, don't get fooled by its metallic looks, is tucked into a compartment at the top of the LG G3 Stylus. It's very easy to pull out, really light and very thin. The G3 Stylus' screen doesn't feature a separate pressure-sensitive digitizer to detect the stylus, in fact it's a regular fancier capacitive pointer that will work on any other capacitive display. It doesn't provide the solid feel the Samsung's S-Pen does, and it has a lot to learn from Samsung's Note exclusive apps. Then again, the LG G3 Stylus isn't a device of such magnitude.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 Stylus runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat with the latest LG launcher, including proprietary features such as the Knock Code, Dual Window, Gesture Shot, Touch &amp; Shoot, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lower resolution display paired with the quad-core 1.3GHz processor and 1GB of RAM provides a snappy experience. The 8GB of inbuilt storage, if not enough for you, can be expanded via a microSD slot placed below the rear cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 Stylus is expected to launch by the end of September.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G Watch R<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartwatches are all the rage here at IFA 2014 with Asus, Samsung and Sony splashing big and, keen to get a piece, LG has shown its first rounded smartwatch - the G Watch R.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a round watch face complete with a 1.3" POLED (plastic organic light-emitting diode) display, a Snapdragon 400 chipset and a battery that will reportedly last a day and a half to two days set to always on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1.3" display has a resolution of 320 x 320px and a resulting density of 245ppi. There's a Snapdragon 400 chipset with 512MB of RAM and IP67 certification for water resistance and dust proofing. The LG G Watch R is powered by a 410mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch comes in two color schemes - with a silver and black steel trim around the display. The watch feels very light for its robust looks. The side-mounted button has a half press and full press functionality - half press shows the homescreen while full press brings up the settings menu. Under the home button lies a microphone for voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch itself feels very nice and is crafted to precision. The calf-leather strap is a standard 22mm, meaning you can replace it with a third party strap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display itself has the great characteristics of OLED technology with deep blacks, great contrast, very good viewing angles and punchy saturated colors. It's quite power-efficient too. The resolution is more than adequate on the LG G Watch R, especially when you're viewing the display at an arms length. OLED is also good outdoors thanks to its low reflectivity but it remains to be seen how the G Watch R will fare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has made 9 watch faces for the G Watch R but we're guessing more will make it to the device sooner or later. We like the designs - all of them are pretty classy and sophisticated. The LG G Watch R will default to its watch face within 5 seconds of non-use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bottom of the LG G Watch R there is a heartrate sensor as well, which is always in contact with your skin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG G Watch R is one of the best smartwatches we've seen so far. It looks great and is made with attention to detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG L Bello<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG L Bello is the bigger 5" smartphone of the new affordable pair. It looks a lot like the LG G3 and G3 Stylus over at the back with the plastic there mimicking a brushed aluminum plate. But don't be fooled, there is no metal on the L Bello - everything is made entirely of plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Bello features a 5" IPS display of FWVGA resolution (that's 480 x 854px), which isn't a great achievement at an underwhelming 196ppi. Unlike the G3 Stylus, whose name has a premium ring to it, we didn't have high expectations for the LG L Bello. The colors are good, while the contrast and brightness levels are just average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG L Bello also has its hardware control deck at the back, below the 8MP rear camera. You can use the Lock key at the back, or you can knock on the display for lock/unlock if you like. The cool Knock Code is available on the LG G Bello, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG L Bello runs on a quad-core 1.3GHz processor with 1GB of RAM, enough to perfectly handle the snappy Android 4.4.2 KitKat OS. It also offers 8GB of internal storage, expandable via a microSD card slot hidden below the rear cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG L Bello should launch worldwide any moment now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>LG L Fino<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG L Fino is the smallest smartphone LG brought to IFA. It features a 4.5" IPS display of WVGA resolution, resulting in 207ppi. It has a quad-core processor too, clocked at 1.2GHz and paired with 1GB of RAM. The Android version is again KitKat and it looks well-behaved on such an affordable device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG L Fino is made entirely of plastic, with quite cheap-looking glossy rear cover that is prone to fingerprints and not so easy to clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>the LG L Fino's control deck is also on the back, just below its 8MP camera lens. It doesn't look as cool as the controls on the LG G3, G3 Stylus or L Bello, but it does the same job. Plus, the proprietary tap to unlock and Knock Code are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG L Fino has the smallest battery among the three smartphones - a 1,900mAh unit compared to the 2,540mAh of the L Bello and the 3,000mAh of the G Stylus. Still, it should be enough for a 4.5" device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the LG L Fino comes with 4GB of inbuilt storage, expandable via a microSD slot. It should launch any moment now (if it hasn't already) in various markets.</paragraph>
