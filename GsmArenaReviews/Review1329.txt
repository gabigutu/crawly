			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering the avalanche of tablets now on the market one could be forgiven for thinking ?How will this one be any different?? The HTC Flyer, though, is nothing if not unique.Yes, it's an Android tablet; but one which has decided to zig when every other droid tablet out there has zagged. It doesn't feature the stock Honeycomb for tablets and goes with Gingerbread instead. It?s topped with the HTC Sense UI 2.1 for tablets , which looks equally good upscaled to the bigger 7? screen, and has the brand new lockscreen from Sense 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a 1.5 GHz single-core processor instead of a dual-core Tegra-or-something chip. The Flyer boasts HTC?s Scribe technology giving you drawing powers on any screen on the tablet. The aluminum unibody has the trademark HTC feel all over it. Oh yes? It's a cool gadget by any standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facing very tough competition, the Flyer relies on its user experience and innovative drawing/imaging technology to up the scales and get on your wish list. While it certainly can't compete with dual-core-powered slates in terms of FullHD 1080p video or the latest games with Unreal 3D engine and whatnot, it can still give users a rich, fun experience. The fact is it?s really pocketable and no burden to handle for longer than 10 minutes. You can literally take it anywhere without having to carry a special bag for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s what the Flyer will bring along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This 7-incher makes you feel HTC didn?t want to shout out loud about their first tablet. At least, they tried to cover almost of the major features users look for in a tablet. When you hold it in your hands you immediately feel the HTC touch; like a steroid-enhanced HTC Sensation. And you can bet that Angry Birds looks good on that lovely big screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Choosing Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread instead of Honeycomb gives the Flyer the advantage of using a custom user interface and full support for the majority of apps out there. (Some regular Android apps have compatibility issues with Honeycomb slates).The downside is absolutely no support for Honeycomb apps, which are the ones meant for tablet use to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Flyer, you choose between a 3G-enabled and Wi-Fi-only version. Either way, phone calls are not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So much for raw specs and expectations. What we're here for is the actual performance. We?re back after the break and eager to see how the Flyer handles pressure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Premium retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer retail package features a dedicated charger (without it the Flyer can sit for hours on a different charger and hardly fill up the battery), a USB cable and a carrying pouch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pouch is made of imitation leather and has a magnetic lock. All the items inside the retail package are white (as the tablet itself), which does seem kind of Apple territory but nowadays is becoming more and more an HTC thing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t a complimentary memory card in the bundle, which isn't such a big deal considering the ample32GB of on-board storage. What we do miss though is a set of headphones. We guess HTC traded those for the carrying pouch, which isn't the best call. After all, the Flyer is the right size for listening to music or watching movies.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Flyer 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer measures 195.4 x 122 x 13.2 mm and weighs 420.8 g. It's very compact and truly portable for a tablet. As stated earlier, it?s actually pocketable even if it is a little on the porky side, weight-wise. That's not to say it crosses the line but is still heavier than you'd expect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC has almost patented the stylish aluminum unibody construction , which is stunning - especially on a bigger handset like the Flyer (yes it's actually compact enough to be called that) - so this tablet is definitely a looker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It feels great in your hand and both the finish and body materials are top notch. It's comfortable to hold and feels sturdy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do like aluminum casings. Plastic is okay but just can't beat the premium feel of cold metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body of the Flyer is curved at every corner and has slightly pronounced top and bottom edges to protect the screen when you place it on its face. The back is curved and mostly made of aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7" 16M-color capacitive screen offers good brightness indoors but is too reflective to comfortably use in the open. Even on the highest settings it feels shy in direct sunlight and will make you wish for a parasol or something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, when indoors, colors are punchy and contrast is good, so the Flyer does have a good display overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display in landscape mode are the secondary video-call camera and a status LED, which lights up when you turn the camera on. It is a 1.3 MP unit, good enough for Skype video calls and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a total of 8 capacitive buttons on the Flyer. HTC has conveniently decided to put them in two sets for use in both landscape and portrait mode. They are the Home, Menu and Search keys along with a dedicated Scribe button. When Scribe mode is active, a touch with the stylus to the Scribe capacitive button will open up the settings menu. More on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the tablet features the volume rocker and two sets of microphones. They are positioned at the top and bottom of the side. They are probably meant for stereo sound recording during video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker has nice press and is large enough for comfortable use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Flyer is bereft of controls. It's smooth and in many cases could end up being the bottom of the device - if you're holding it in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top are the 3.5 mm audio jack and the power/sleep button. It took some getting used to because it's small and fairly tricky to access on such a big device. Under the power button there's a status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom side of the Flyer is home only to the USB connector/charging port. No protective cover here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Flyer is where the unibody really flaunts its minimalism. It?s aluminum for the most part, with two narrow strips of white plastic. The top one is where you'll find the camera lens and the bottom looks like a cover but cannot actually be opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Flyer is really the only detachable part. It isn't very easy to open and we suggest you read the quick guide before attempting it, to avoid damaging the tablet. Slide it open and you'll see the camera module, the microSD card slot and the SIM compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the Flyer's back panel are the two stereo speakers. They are reassuringly loud, especially when the device is on its back on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a better look at the bulging lower plastic bit of the Flyer. It gives you a better grip over the tablet than some of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is not exchangeable as it's tucked under the aluminum plate. We guess if you're ever in need of a replacement battery you'd have to turn to HTC themselves; that is if you care about your warranty. The battery is a 4000 mAh unit and it's quoted at up to 1470 hours of standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't have any complaints about the actual battery life, aside from the fact that unless you're using the humungous HTC charger you're in for a powerless tablet. We hooked up the Flyer to a bunch of chargers with a microUSB plug and all of them seemed to take an eternity charging the device. Only the Flyer?s original charger did the trick in less then several hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a tablet signed by HTC, the Flyer?s premium build and finish are hardly a surprise. It will make you feel special and you will never shy to show it off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not least, it's one of the friendliest tablets around, size and weight-wise. It weighs a little less than the Galaxy Tab 8.9 and is compact enough to even fit inside a pocket. The screen has its issues but the indoor performance is perfectly fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the compact size is a selling point in itself. On a second thought, anything bigger than the Flyer would?ve questioned the actual key selling point: the Magic Pen. No point though in guessing which came first ? the 7? screen or the stylus. Let's take a look at the HTC Scribe in more detail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Scribe lets you paint mustaches on Stephen Elop and stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Scribe stylus is just an ordinary pen at first glance. Then you begin noticing that it has a strange tip which is rather bigger than on ordinary pens and the thing also offers two buttons on its side. The first one is the Highlighter button as it gives you the option to highlight text. The second is the eraser button. All pretty much self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pen is powered by a single AAA alkaline battery. The stylus is bundled with the 3G-enabled version of the Flyer. People who go for the Wi-Fi-only model will have to pay an extra 80 bucks for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Scribe technology is among the main differentiating points of the Flyer compared to the current crop of tablets. Drawing, putting down notes and annotating stuff ? it all makes sense on a big screen device such as a tablet so our guess is other manufacturers will follow suit in this direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way Scribe works is you just tap on any screen (except on animated screens like the weather animation) and the Flyer immediately takes a snapshot, which you can then draw and write on with the special stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an inconspicuous capacitive button on the Flyer just next to the main home, menu and back keys, which is backlit in yellow with the stylus icon. When you touch it with the pen, a menu in the lower-right corner pops up to reveal the Scribe options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can select a special tool like a brush, an ink pen, pencil, marker, etc. You can then adjust the size of the stroke to be from hair thin to graffiti thick. You can also adjust the color you'll be painting or writing with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a special brush type you can select, which acts as an eraser but a hardware button on the side of the stylus toggles eraser mode as well. The other button is used to highlight text and is very useful for situations like reading a book with the built-in Reader app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can write on anything you like, except on moving, animated screens. For instance, a browser page is no problem (even with Flash content) but the animated weather widget screen is off limits and you'll get a prompt saying it's not possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Scribe technology is great fun but really doesn't excel beyond simple fooling around drawing. If you'd like to go pro with a tablet the Flyer probably isn't the one to do it with.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: tablet-ready Sense UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Instead of going for the tablet-ready Android Honeycomb, HTC chose to stick with 2.3 Gingerbread for its Flyer tablet. The Taiwanese company thought it would be smart to bring the tablet optimizations through their Sense launcher, rather than a different OS, which was probably a good idea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way the Flyer has access to a huge number of apps that aren't compatible with Honeycomb yet and saves itself some of the performance issues that we saw in the first tablets running Android 3.0 (Honeycomb). Since HTC already confirmed that they will be updating the Flyer to Honeycomb eventually the company is probably just waiting for the right moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So as a result, the HTC Flyer UI is merely an upscaled version of the HTC Sensation?s, with a small tweak here and there to make a better use of the larger screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well done to HTC for the new lockscreen. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone (Honeycomb, anyone?). Or, you can drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's not the end of it - the HTC Flyer, just like the Sensation also offers plenty of alternative lockscreens. You can access the others from the Personalize menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We find the Photo album lockscreen, which tosses photos from your gallery in cool 3D graphics to be among the more attractive options, but there's the Friend Stream widget which shows SNS updates from your friends and the Weather widget, which shows off the Sense UI's cool weather animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Stocks too - with quotes flying up or down, again, in eye-pleasing 3D graphics. Finally, there's the Clock lockscreen, which shows a bigger clock - you can pick any of the 11 clock widgets you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going further than the lockscreen reveals the Sense homescreen. There, we meet a scroll arc at the bottom that is just an indication of which homescreen pane you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s Leap view instead - tap the home key (while on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense comes with HTC proprietary Scenes ? essentially custom homescreen setups. Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. Those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes (older Sense versions prompted you to save modifications as a new scene) and you can get more scenes off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with a unique wallpaper image and use different colors for various UI elements. They can also replace the standard dock, lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with icons. You can set different sorting options - alphabetically, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There's an alternative list layout too if that's what you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? All apps, Frequent and Favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of items to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget, you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are seventeen different clocks (yes, seventeen!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Twitter widget, for instance, shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet/update status. The other version is more compact and only allows status updates and tweets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from your vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can it drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the bottom corners of the screen of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. A press and hold of the Home button works too. The notification area is tabbed too - the second tab has toggles for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings and the last line shows used/free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard task switcher, you get a task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now the HTC Flyer benchmark results show that its 1.5GHz single-core CPU comes quite close to its dual-core competitors in pure processing power. The higher clock speed and the lower helps it do decently against the Tegra 2-packing XOOM, but the Flyer is no match for the Galaxy S II and its Exynos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus Flyer competitors might have more to offer in terms of future-proofing, which is not to be neglected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC-Sensed phonebook with social skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Flyer has HTC?s all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just the first tab ? the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages between you and the given contact in a conversation layout. The third tab is a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs are what turn the Flyer into a powerful networking tool. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging enhanced<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Writing SMS messages on a tablet seems kind of unpractical. But in reality is fun, easy and pretty cool with it. The Flyer supports SMS, MMS and email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is bigger and covers nearly half of the screen in landscape mode. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input begins and ends with the built-in virtual QWERTY keyboard of the Flyer. Other options are available via the Android Market. The big 7-incher is much more comfortable to type on than on a phone. Thanks to the Flyer's small stature (for a tablet) it easily allows two finger typing in portrait mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>G?Email is seamless<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As with any recent HTC device, the Flyer comes with two email clients, which basically do it all in a similar way (save for the convenient homescreen widget for the default mail app) - the HTC mail and the Gmail apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app features several tabs that let you filter the inbox: you can opt to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or invitations. You can mark emails too ? they will show up in the marked mail tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Flyer lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The new image gallery is cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC gallery has changed - it now stacks photos like the vanilla Android gallery does (it used to display a list of thumbnails). The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution. You can also select which folders the gallery should display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery looks exactly the same as on the Sensation, save for the landscape view. When you turn the device sideways it slips two screens into view - the first one with all the albums and a preview of each separate album too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with the HTC Sensation, the Flyer supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo on the device is very straightforward ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube. You could use DLNA to push photos to your compatible TV too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t copy/paste images from folder to folder either ? you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player has DivX/Xvid support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Flyer also offers the same video player as the Sensation. Though this time there's no shortcut for it from the main menu and the only way to access it is from the gallery via the All videos album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files are displayed as a grid and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr, even apps like Dropbox if you have it installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC Flyer offers a full screen toggle (stretch / crop video to fit the screen) and you can scrub through videos. SRS sound enhancement is also available but there?s no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does OK in general except the Flyer can only go up to 720p playback. The player handled all 720p DivX or Xvid videos. We couldn't find a video it couldn't play, except those that were FullHD, MKV files and others too tough to handle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased (at least our unit had, which featured a Vodafone music shop).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dropdown at the top of the screen lets you switch between your library on the phone and DLNA media servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flyer offers SRS sound enhancement to boost the listening experience. If you plug in headphones, you can change equalizer settings too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. Other goodies include looking up a song on YouTube or updating the album art for the current or all songs. You can enable auto update too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the bar at the top of the screen that says "HTC Flyer" lets you play the song on another device wirelessly - either over DLNA or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. Other goodies include looking up a song on YouTube or updating the album art for the current or all songs. You can enable auto update too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the bar at the top of the screen that says "HTC Flyer" lets you play the song on another device wirelessly - either over DLNA or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a neat feature - a 3D card stays on and lets you control the music player (previous, next and play/pause). The card also shows the album art and name of the song and artist. You can flip the card - it's reverse sideshows album art and track info too, but lacks music controls. That's not particularly useful but is good eye candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a music recognition app ? SoundHound. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer is not as good as the iPad in terms of audio output, but it can stand its ground against every other competitor quite well. Its only problem is that its not as loud as you might expect a device this big to be - in fact there are plenty of smartphones louder than it. Other than that there isn't much to frown at really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like to use an active external amplifier the Flyer will produce good clean output as verified by the scores in our test. The stereo crosstalk is slightly higher than we are used to under those circumstances, but it's still virtually undetectable with a naked ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The really great news is that marks remained impressively high even after we plugged in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk is the only part of its performance to actually worsen and it didn't deteriorate nearly as much as with other devices we have tested. Of all the devices we have tested the Flyer is probably the one that handles headphones the best. Kudos to HTC for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera has lens issues<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer packs a 5 MP autofocus camera, which can take photos of 2592x1944 pixels resolution. You don't get a LED flash on it so low-light photography isn't an option even if you are the sort of nut to bring a tablet as a camera replacement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very space efficient. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. There?s a virtual zoom lever on the left. By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off (note that cropping reduces the resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with most HTC smart devices nowadays the Flyer too offers touch autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual image quality on the Flyer that we tested is severely compromised by some lens issues. Almost the entire left side of the pictures looks smudged and out of focus with a lot of the detail in them smeared and fuzzy. On the other hand, colors look good, though not nearly as punchy as we like them. Contrast levels are acceptable. We guess, if you get a non-defective unit, the image quality produced by the camera will be ok.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a macro photo, taken by the HTC Flyer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Flyer is definitely not the go-to device for amateur photography. Sure, it smacks the iPad 1 and 2 cameras around but hardly steps up to even some of the low-end 5 MP phones out there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For comparison's sake we include the HTC Flyer in our photo quality compare tool. It's not that it's awful, it's just that the issues it has with the camera aren?t conducive to the comparison being fair. Still you can see how it fares against the Optimus Pad and the Xoom tablet. The Optimus Pad is superior to the Flyer as it offers great image quality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mediocre 720p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer records videos in 3gp format and can go as up as 720p resolution. Due to the insufficient processor power it can?t handle 1080p encoding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder follow suit to the camera one. It's easy to use and you get all the settings on the right side with many customizable options like the video resolution, recording limit and adding effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but only before you start shooting ? then the focus is locked and won?t change even if you get closer or move back. Still, the Sensation had no problems focusing at even very close distances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the video is nothing to shout about. Not to mention that our unit has obvious lens issues and smeared most of the detail in one corner like it did with photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no telling what the actual quality would be without the defective camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 720p video sample, made by the Flyer. Click the fullscreen button for better viewing. Keep in mind that YouTube applies some compression to the video, which takes its toll on quality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer enters our video quality compare tool to face the Motorola Xoom and the Apple iPad 2. Sadly even though it offers a better camera, resolution-wise it's no match even for the iPad 2's resolution detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity goes premium<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer enjoys a great connectivity suite. It offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and blazing fast tri-band 3G: 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink thanks to HSPA. Wi-Fi connectivity supports standards b/g/n plus DNLA and hotspot functionality. Stereo Bluetooth 3.0 is also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll also find a 3.5 mm headphones jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main thing missing is an HDMI port. That is a real disappointment as a capable tablet without HDMI is behind the rest of the tide and that's something the Flyer doesn't want to be. At least it's not plagued by any death grip issues that we?ve seen on some other HTC products lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (Mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computer?s Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive now have big, thumbable icons, which is great since they are used most often.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great web browser on a big portable screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer enjoys a big, high-resolution display, powerful processor and the latest Android for phones so it's naturally got support for Flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address bar is accompanied by a search, bookmarks, add bookmark and tabs shortcuts. HTC really made use for that added space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser chrome keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are home, share page, downloads, history, print and a more button. Hitting more reveals slightly less than it did before on smaller droids - you have find on page, select text, page info and settings. The select text option is kind of obsolete as holding a finger over plain text on the page automatically highlights and lets you select.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flyer has support for text reflow, which works great at any given zoom level. It resizes columns to fit the screen area you're focused on and really saves you the hassle to move around to read the entire text. Sadly a reader option is missing on droids as it would be very convenient on such a big screen. What we mean is to have the option to view an article without the ads and all other distractions on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer has full Flash support. It played everything up to 720p - in the browser itself and on Kongregate when we tested a Flash game. Getting your surf on isn't a problem with the Flyer and viewing pages on the ample 7" screen is far better than on any phone we've encountered so far as it just gives you more of a netbook experience than a phone one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full-fledged organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Flyer, with a mobile Office app to boot that can both view and edit documents (no payment required). There are also a ton of entertainment apps on it such as the Reader, Notes, Scribe and more. The Notes app even syncs your notes online so that you never lose anything important.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you think of organizing on a smartphone (or tablet) the first app that pops in your mind is the calendar. It has five different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly, agenda and invitation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator app is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app on the Flyer features an alarm clock, stopwatch and a timer all in one. It has a nice big-screen optimized look and is pretty intuitive and easy to operate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can naturally set as many alarms as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch is easy to use and offers lap differentiation. The timer is pretty self-explanatory. You set a period of time and the Flyer starts counting backwards. An alarm goes off when the preset time runs out. It does feature a very iPhone-esque UI with the rotating time wheels.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android market, HTCsense.com<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.), so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option to display all apps in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTCSense.com integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your Flyer if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your Flyer's contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. Of course all of this doesn't apply to the Flyer, save for message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the Sensation in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy but if you?re using an updated browser you should be fine. However, HTCSense.com failed to load properly in Internet Explorer 9 but it worked once we enabled Compatibility Mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation the HTC-slash-Google way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Flyer has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in about a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps Street view looks a feels way better on the bigger 7" screen of the Flyer. In essence it's exactly the same as on handsets - it just gives you more room to enjoy it on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An alternative form of navigation is the new HTC Locations. With it you can download country maps for free, or just cache maps as you browse (the size of the cache is adjustable). Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can calculate new routes even when offline ? and Gmaps can?t (it can only reroute you, not calculate a new route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t do voice-guided navigation for free like Ovi Maps though ? but still, you can use the list of instructions and tap the next and pervious arrows to see the next turn. Not ideal but it?s a great addition, especially since it?s free. You can always pay for a voice-guided navigation license too - it's cheaper than buying a dedicated GPS unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better look of what?s ahead. It?s just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode ? at first it seems choppy, but that?s only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world). You could use two fingers to rotate the camera manually too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>That?s that then. One of the most unique Android tablets out there - the HTC Flyer. It does well - even without the all-important dual-core processor and cream-of-the-crop Honeycomb OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing that sets it apart from most tablets, is the HTC Sense topping and the HTC Scribe technology. This is as close to unique as it gets for the Flyer. In all other aspects a rival tablet can be found to top it - speed, display, imaging, body size and weight, and price. So this tablet is one that comes with a few compromises. You can do better ? and it doesn?t even depend on the amount of cash you have at your disposal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flyer will cost you about 650 euro (~$925) for the 3G-capable version and 500 euro (~$712) for the Wi-Fi only version. It's not cheap at all ? but we?re used to seeing HTC charge a premium for build quality and customizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple are usually no different but even the iPad 2 costs less than that. The unique iOS experience will set you back about 490 euro or $690. It's the most popular tablet and the sequel to a trend-setter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Apple iPad 2 ? Apple iPad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as a reference, the original Galaxy Tab ? may as well make you forgive the lower-clock CPU with a sweet price tag of 270 euro (~$380).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry PlayBook is a major challenger in the same 7-inch league. It will run circles around the Flyer with its dual-core TI OMAP 4430 chipset. We wouldn?t say no to the fluid handling, great multi-tasking ability and FullHD video either. Then there's the price, 385 euro or about $550 doesn?t sound too bad. The PlayBook only loses to the Flyer in the connectivity: a European 3G enabled version is still to come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry PlayBook</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 8.9 3G certainly deserves a nod too. It's almost the same size and weight and offers a far superior 8.9" display. A dual-core tablet as well, it outperforms the Flyer by some distance. It will set you back about 440 euro (~$630), which is the price of the Wi-Fi only version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can plainly see, the Flyer will have to battle enemies on all fronts. And it doesn't have the weapons to stop most of them. It's slightly subpar in today's power-crazed market of uber-slates edging into netbook territory. If you're in it for the best there is, the Flyer may not be what you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you like something different, which easily stands out in the crowd, you might well want to give it a spin.</paragraph>
