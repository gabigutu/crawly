			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another one in a long line of X5 models, the vivo X5Pro is perhaps the most balanced of the bunch. All the others have a defining feature: the X5Max is the thinnest, its Platinum edition has a humongous battery, and even the plain X5 stands out, be it for the wrong reason of having a 720p screen only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meanwhile the X5Pro sits midway in terms of display diagonal, has an average battery for its size, and the same base hardware - the chipset, RAM and primary camera are shared among them all. Sure, the X5Pro has an 8MP selfie shooter, when the rest make do with just 5MP, but that's hardly a decider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And just when you thought that there's nothing all that special about the X5Pro, you see that its Funtouch OS is built upon Android 5.0.2. The smartphone is the company's only model running Lollipop, the rest of the X5's still stuck on KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some might think the OS version is just a number, but (spoiler alert!) the X5Pro proved superior to the X5Max in terms of performance, while matching its battery life. We're inclined to attribute a large part of that advantage to Google's newer release (now almost obsolete itself, with 6.0 Marshmallow around the corner).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It should be noted that a Mediatek-powered version is also in existence, relying on the MT6752 chip with a few other differences in hardware and features. It's not meant to leave its home Chinese market though, so we're reviewing the international Snapdragon variant instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once we're past the spec sheet and holding it in our hands, the X5Pro has another feature to show off - its dual-glass build. Its metal-clad brethren all have a common styling, which this one doesn't adhere to. But being different from the Max, which we praised for its looks, doesn't make the Pro any less attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well-equipped and good-looking, the X5Pro sounds like a promising package, but let's not rush it. We kick off on the next page with the unboxing and hardware overview.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package with attention to detail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro arrives in typical company fashion and that means a stylish white box with separately packaged accessories inside. The bundle has the basics covered, starting with a (somewhat slow) 5V/1A AC adapter, a USB cable and a headset with a single-button remote and round cords. Additionally, you get a frosted bumper back cover, which wraps around the sides as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>vivo X5Pro 360° spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering the company still holds the world's thinnest smartphone record with the Chinese version of the X5Max, those who expect a slim smartphone won't be disappointed by the X5Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device measures 147.9 x 73.5 x 6.4mm and weighs 151g, which makes for a nicely manageable 5.2-inch smartphone. It's pretty much the same size as the Sony Xperia Z2/Z3/Z3+ that have the same screen diagonal and dual-glass build. The record-holder X5Max is notably larger, and even though it's paper thin, this one is easier to handle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Body and design, controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To get it out of the way from the start, there's a certain iPhone 6 air to the vivo X5Pro. Of course that excludes the back, which Apple made of aluminum, but not vivo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro is built like a tank - if tanks were made of glass, that is. Unlike all of its siblings, which have brushed metal backs, the Pro boasts a dual-glass design. Metal has been limited to the outer frame and also the inner body, naturally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything fits together tightly to form a very solid device. Thanks to the heft of the glass and the thin profile the smartphone feels quite robust, in an expensive kind of way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The premium touches are all over. Both slabs of glass end with a fine taper at the edges. Couple that with the slight bulge along the entire frame, and your fingers never have to touch a sharp edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will struggle to keep the X5Pro clean though, as the glass picks up fingerprints quite easily. Our white review unit does well to mask them on the back, but they are a lot more visible on the front with the display off, and we'd expect that the black version would require more frequent wiping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X5Pro adopts the customary company control layout. You have the capacitive Menu/Home/Back buttons in the bottom bezel, which don't have backlighting, but are reflective and visible under almost any circumstances. The top bezel houses the earpiece along with the proximity/ambient light sensors and the 8MP selfie cam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalistic back only features the primary camera lens and a single LED flash. The flash sits behind the glass back panel, but the lens needed a tiny bit more room and sticks out by about half a millimeter. The subtly raised frame makes sure the phone isn't resting on the lens itself when lying on its back. Not that it should be a problem, considering its sapphire crystal coating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>vivo crammed almost everything on the right side of the phone, leaving the left completely bare. Top to bottom, you have the volume rocker, power button and a dual card slot. The second (nano) SIM slot doubles as a microSD slot, so make sure to pick up a microSIM card for the primary one if you want to use the memory expansion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features the microUSB port, which is upside down, compared to what most people are used to, so you may be faced with a short period of adjustment. There's a single speaker behind the left mesh, while the right one is there for symmetry and to accommodate the mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard 3.5mm headphone jack is on top, but we didn't see a pinhole for a secondary mic, so no noise cancelling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro is perhaps the borderline size for comfortable single-handed use. A lot of people refuse to go the phablet route and the 5.2-inch diagonal is a reasonable compromise between screen estate and pocketability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you won't be able to reach all the way across with your thumb without readjusting your grip, but the bottom position of the quick toggles means you don't have to stretch out to the top all that often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual glass design means the X5Pro is very slippery. That is easy to live when holding it with your hand, when dirt and tighter grip provide the necessary friction. However, you should be careful leaving it on any smooth surface, which is less than perfectly horizontal, as it may slide off in a heartbeat.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5.2-inch Super AMOLED is sharp, but not very bright<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro is equipped with a 5.2-inch FullHD Super AMOLED display with a pixel density of 424ppi. It has the vivid output you'd expect from such a panel, but has no extra color saturation settings. Viewing angles are great too, with only a minor drop of contrast when looked from the sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our microscope shot revealed a diamond pentile matrix, with smaller but twice as many green subpixels as the other two colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our lab tests aren't overly flattering of the X5Pro though. Sure, it has the perfect blacks inherent to AMOLED, but the brightness is somewhat low. It's noticeably darker than the X5Max and the Honor 7. If it's any consolation, the Oppo R7 isn't much brighter and the Samsung Galaxy A7 posts a virtually identical number. The 50% setting is actually less than 30% of maximum, a rather common occurrence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the vivo X5Pro aced the sunlight legibility test. Keeping it company are the Samsung Galaxy A7 and Note Edge, and the Oppo R5 is close by as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro is a dual-SIM dual-standby device. One of the cards gets the full 2G/3G/4G treatment across multiple bands each, while the other is limited to 2G. You can decide which one is which in the settings and the micro/nano SIM slots mean you can use either form factor as your main card. You'd need to go microSIM and forget about dual-SIM functionality though if you value the memory expansion, as the microSD slot is shared with the nanoSIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone has dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n with DLNA, Wi-Fi direct and hotspot support. The hotspot doesn't get a quick toggle though, and you have to delve into the settings There's Bluetooth v4.0, but no NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's GPS with A-GPS for precise positioning over cellular. There's also an FM radio receiver, but no RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB On-The-Go and lets you attach peripherals and you can also daisy chain several devices. A standard 3.5mm jack completes the wired connectivity package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The battery inside the vivo X5Pro is a 2,450mAh unit. It's a decent capacity for the screen diagonal and the hardware inside. Considering that the X5Max had a larger display and a smaller battery, yet did well in our tests, we expected another strong performance from the Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3G call endurance is a respectable 17 hours, a few minutes short of the X5Max. Oddly enough, the Pro posted virtually identical results in those of our tests, which are carried out with the display on. The web browsing endurance is a negligible 15 minutes longer, while the 3 minutes shorter video playback is well within the margin of error. This makes the Pro the less frugal of the two, considering that it has an advantage in both screen size and battery capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the vivo X5Pro is adequately powered, and should have no problem lasting you through the day. Our endurance score is based on an assumed pattern of an hour each of 3G calls, web browsing and video playback per day. In a similar scenario, the phone will last two and a half days between charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Funtouch has finally made the move to Lollipop<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>vivo hasn't been too quick to adopt Google's Lollipop, but the X5Pro finally comes with Android 5.0 out of the box. Naturally, there's the company's proprietary Funtouch overlay, and it's nigh identical to the 4.4 KitKat-based version on the recently reviewed vivo X5Max, so recurring vivo users will feel right at home. Previous iPhone owners will have an easy transition to Android too, as the inspiration for Funtouch is rather obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn't like before, we'll have to reiterate. The stock Android menu arrangement is gone, and the one on the X5Pro requires some getting used to, before you learn where things are. vivo has tried to simplify things and make the most used settings readily available, but we're happier with Google's logical arrangement, even if requires an extra tap every now and then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone has the entire Google suite preinstalled and there's few (if any) additional apps, though we're not sure if that's the case on all markets. Light on the bloatware, the smartphone doesn't omit basics like a proper calendar and calculator apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is largely similar to the one found on the X5Max. There's a standard issue clock widget on top, followed by a customizable signature, where you can set up an uplifting quote to start your day. In the bottom half there's an avatar box and you can assign a number of different animated ones or choose a photo from the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new touches here come in the form of lockscreen notifications, a feature Google introduced with Lollipop, and it now makes its way to Funtouch. The other modifications come in the form of two shortcuts in the bottom corners - dialer and camera by default. However, you do get to assign any other app of your choice to either one - we like. Unlocking only works with an upward swipe, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Past the lockscreen you get the same single-tier interface with no app drawer. The number of homescreen panes doesn't appear to be limited to a single page of thumbs (which holds 9) and we quickly concluded you won't be left without room for new apps. You can rearrange the homescreens any way you like and the one you place first is the default one that appears when you tap the Home button. The panes cannot be cycled, which can prove a problem if you have a large number of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is where all your apps will show after installation in a grid of 4x5 icons. You can group them in folders and tapping on a folder shows its contents in a nicely animated popup on a blurred background (wonder where we've seen that). There's a dock on the bottom of the homescreen, which takes up to 5 icons, folders included, and redistributes them evenly, depending on the number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Menu button brings out the widget library, as well as the option to select a transition effect for the homescreen panes. You also get the option to hide apps you don't want displayed on the homescreen, and they can be password-protected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major difference to your average Android interface is vivo's separation of the notification shade and the quick toggles for changing settings. Swiping down from the top brings out the list of notifications where you also get the carrier's name and reminders for upcoming calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meanwhile, swiping up from the bottom edge brings out a combined toggles/brightness/tasks drawer, reminiscent of the iOS Control center. Closing apps works with an upward flick, but there's no Kill all button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness slider doesn't take taps if you want to jump straight to a specific position, instead you need to grab it by the handle each time. There's an Auto switch too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The toggles offer the expected functionality and aside from the simple on/off action work as shortcuts to the respective setting upon a long press. All of them are listed in a singled side-scrollable row, and you can rearrange them or hide unused ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a theming engine that changes the entire look of the smartphone with lock and homescreen wallpapers and icon packs. There's only the default theme preinstalled, but there's plenty more online, available for free. As always, some work better than others with apps outside of the standard package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>vivo has also devised a nifty and truly useful screen-grabbing utility called S-capture. Chief among its features is the ability to capture long screenshots, for example an entire webpage or a conversation in a messaging app. Alternatively, you could record a video of what's going on the screen, like gameplay or instructional videos. The Funny screenshot option lets you crop a part of the screen with a freeform or preset shape, of which there are a few.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro comes with extensive gesture and motion functionality, found in settings under Smart motion. Smart wake works with the display off and lets you draw letters to launch specific apps, unlock with an upward swipe without lighting the screen beforehand or launch the camera with a downward swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air operation holds options for a quick status glance or air unlock, both triggered by a hand wave at the front camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's smart light which covers three features. One claims to wake up the phone when you take it out of your pocket, next is the familiar double-tap-to-wake in a different wording, and Smart keep bright uses the front camera to detect you're looking at the phone so it doesn't go into standby while you're reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart call contains the gestures for picking up and muting calls, while Smart remind will vibrate when you pick the phone off the table to indicate you have pending notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi window is similar to Sony's Smart apps and pop's up a tiny window where you can watch a video, create or view notes and access your messaging inbox.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro is another in a long line of midrangers, which rely on the proven Snapdragon 615 formula. This holds true for the international version we're reviewing, as there's another one, powered by the Mediatek 6752 chip, but limited to the Chinese market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S615 is so popular that we have 43 devices in our database, which while extensive is certainly not exhaustive. That number has grown from the 36 we had a month ago, when we reviewed vivo's own X5Max - guess the chip in that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though it's the same base hardware, vivo has tinkered it a bit differently for the Pro compared to the Max. Where the clock rates of the Max were 1.5GHz and 1.0GHz for the performance and efficiency quad-core clusters respectively, the Pro's numbers are 1.5GHz and 1.1GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And as you know, just because it's the same hardware, doesn't remotely mean that the same results are to be expected. Variations in clock rates (up to a maximum of 1.7GHz), coupled with different screen resolutions lead to markedly different scores, and that's before we factor in the level of software optimization, achieved by the manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This becomes evident pretty quickly, as the vivo X5Pro sits towards the bottom of the S615 crowd in GeekBench, only to find itself near the top in Antutu. Apparently, the modest clock speeds have hurt the device in the CPU-only Geekbench, but overall performance is top-notch (given the innards, of course). Bear in mind that Antutu is dominated here by Mediatek-equipped devices, and the Lenovo Vibe X2 is running the Chinese chipmaker current top-dog, the Helio X10, f.k.a. MT6595.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Judging by the Antutu score, one would expect that the X5Pro would perform admirably in the other compound benchmarks, but that isn't exactly so. The overall score in the older Basemark OS II is uninspiring, though it's noticeably higher than the X5Max and the Huawei P8lite (the Kirin 620 version).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II 2.0 is a bit more flattering, and the X5Pro places towards the middle of the pack. Its single-core performance helps its case, and since a lot of apps can only utilize a single CPU core, this is arguably the more important number. The multi-core result is rather low though, about half of what the Samsung Galaxy A7 is capable of with the same chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Graphics performance is good, as long as you have in mind we're talking about the combination of an Adreno 405 GPU and a FullHD display. In the onscreen parts of GFXBench there's a clear line between the 1080p and 720p devices, indicating that the GPU is a lot better suited to HD screens. In the standardized 1080p offscreen T-Rex routine, however, the X5Pro is a frame behind the majority of similarly equipped devices. The more demanding Manhattan test shows little difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Basemark X has all the Snapdragon 615s closely spaced, but the vivo X5Pro is still among the best performers, with only the Oppo R7 noticeably better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browser performance is another area where the X5Pro does pretty well. It's on par with the Galaxy A7 when it comes to handling JavaScript in the Kraken 1.1 benchmark, though the Oppo R7 escapes to the top again with some 10% better scores. General HTML performance is top notch, in its own right and especially compared to the mediocre X5Max.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the vivo X5Pro is a dependable performer, often outclassing competitors with the same hardware. Most importantly, vivo has done a much better job with optimizing the software package and the Pro does considerably better than the Max. The improvement could be partially attributed to the newer Android version (the Pro is running Lollipop, while the Max is still on KitKat), but whatever the reasons, the result is what counts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the vivo X5Pro is called Contacts and follows the general styling of the rest of the interface, meaning it's entirely custom. There are tabs, but unless you are big on groups, or want to jump to the dialer or to your personal info page all the time, chances are you won't be using them too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main interface is a well-organized list, with favorite contacts at the top, followed by an alphabetical rundown of the rest. Naturally, there is a search field, which accepts both names and numbers, as well as a vertical slider, along the letters to the right, for quick navigation. There are no contact pics on this screen though, with vivo opting to fit more but thinner rows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new contact is a pretty straightforward process. It begins by selecting where you would like to store the entry, or you can just set a default the first time you use it. The rest is fairly self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact is done through a clean and well-arranged interface. All in all vivo has tried to keep things as simple and intuitive as possible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default telephone app in the vivo X5Pro is in keeping with the overall style, just like the contacts. In fact, they almost look like they are both part of the same application, especially thanks to the pretty sliding transition effect between them. But they are very much separate, despite being linked to one another through a quick shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The intuitive contact searching system is implemented here as well. You can start typing a number or a name and the phone will find the contact you are looking for. In-call options are mostly standard, with the exception of the notes option, which is quite handy when you want to write something down during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X5Pro call quality is very good. Both parties report good sound levels, but the apparent lack of noise cancellation may prove troublesome if you frequently use the phone in noisy settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker volume of the X5Pro is worthy of a Good rating. It's an improvement over the X5Max in terms of decibels, and it means you should be able to hear the ringer in relatively loud environments. Even at the maximum setting there aren't signs of distortion, but don't expect miracles on the low end of the sound spectrum.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Aside from the ever-present Google Hangouts, you also get vivo's own messaging app. It unifies SMS and MMS functionality in one place, which has pretty much become the norm with modern devices. The app does offer the option to import old messages, which is a rare thing to see and can definitely be useful. Messages can be restored from either a cloud service or simply from local storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To handle emails the X5Max offers Gmail preloaded, obviously, as well as a dedicated email app. This is kind of redundant, seeing how the latest version of Google's mail client can now work with any mail account, Google or not, and is now the only email client you will need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you enjoy the consistency of using all Funtouch apps though, the built-in email client can work with web and POP3 accounts alike. A button to start a new message sits at the top right of the app. The composition screen holds no surprises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of text input, the vivo X5Pro comes with a custom keyboard solution, courtesy of Swype. Like the name suggests, it does support swipe typing and looks and behaves quite nicely. It also offers a lot of options, like a personalized dictionary, theme support and quite a few gestures for accessing various features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Albums is a rather basic gallery app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro comes with a simple gallery. It consists of two tabs, one for your camera roll, the other for your various albums. Either way, you get a grid of thumbnails, four in a row. Hitting the search tool doubles the number of thumbs and groups them by month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a single image offers the usual basic options like cropping and rotation as well as a quick shortcut for sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro allows you to edit photos straight from the gallery. The editor itself is packed with features, ranging from trivial cropping and effects all the way up to fine-tuning colors, shadows, exposure and applying different blurs. It is definitely more than enough for quickly fixing up a photo before uploading it online.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro comes with a dedicated video application. It offers a quite basic interface and few advanced features, but definitely gets the job done. The player itself does offer Hi-Fi support as well as DLNA and subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as format support goes, the X5Pro didn't have any issues with playing every video we threw at it, be it DivX, XviD, MOV, WMV, MP4, MKV, including files with the typically problematic AC3 sound. It also has good support for subtitles, though no actual options for customizing them. Another interesting feature is the pop-out mode. It spawns a small draggable video window on top of the UI, but you can't resize it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio player has headphone profiles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player, bundled with Funtouch OS and interestingly named iMusic, doesn't look overly impressive but is quite pleasant to use and has a few tricks hidden away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Launching the app brings you to a selection of quite a few browsing options. Songs can be browsed in various categories and playlists are easily accessible, for even more flexibility. The smartphone comes with preinstalled sound profiles for a few headsets, one of them the bundled XE600i.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main playback interface consists of a backdrop of album art and a simple control pad. You get two toggles altogether, one for Repeat/Shuffle and another for switching on Hi-Fi mode, but it only works with headphones attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vivo has thrown another little treat in the music application. It is a simple timer, but one that is tied to your music player. With it, you can easily fall asleep to your favorite jams, without worrying about draining your battery overnight. It can even power-down the device completely, once the deadline is reached.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio lacks RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike other models of the company, the vivo X5Pro has an FM radio receiver. It's a very basic implementation and doesn't support RDS, so you need to enter station names manually.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo X5Pro did very well in our audio quality test. The smartphone combined perfect scores with a loud output around when used with an active external amplifier - not quite as impressive as the X5Max, but still better than most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones didn't drop the loudness - the X5Pro remained more than adequate here. Some stereo crosstalk crept in and an undetectable amount of intermodulation distortion, but the quality is still pretty solid .</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP camera delivers good output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro is equipped with a 13MP sensor, which outputs images up to 4,160 x 3,120 pixels in a 4:3 native aspect ratio. The lens aperture is a bright f/2.0, and there's also an LED flash to assist in dark environments. It lacks fancy features like OIS or phase detection autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app uses a combined interface for stills and video, which brings the common issue of different coverage between the two, so you can't properly frame your video until you actually hit record. Other than that it's a clean interface with only the absolute basics displayed at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the usual shooting modes like HDR, Panorama and Night. In terms of settings you're pretty limited, and for example you can only set a 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio, but not different resolutions for each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo enthusiasts will be pleased to find a Pro mode, evoked with an inward swipe from the shutter button. This gives you access to a lot of manual controls, including exposure compensation (in 1/3 increments), ISO sensitivity (all the way up to ISO1600), shutter speed (only up to 1s, the X5Max could go all the way to 32s), white balance presets and manual focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a number of grid and spiral overlays to assist you with framing, and if that's not enough, you also get a digital level. These are only available in the Pro mode though, which in a way is a shooting mode itself. What that means is you can forget about shooting HDR, for example, with the level or grids on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality from the X5Pro is nice with accurate exposure and pleasing colors, if a little warm. There's a lot of detail to be found in the photos, but they can take a bit of extra sharpening in post-processing, the default output is somewhat soft. You may not notice it when viewing photos to fit the screen, but pixel peeping reveals plenty of noise in uniform colored areas, admittedly the less distracting luminance type. It's not like it's the first time we say it, but it does hold true for the X5Pro too - the smartphone has a pretty limited dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could try to remedy that, using the HDR mode, which does produce usable images. The Pro's effect is more pronounced than the Max' and the photos come out a little over the top. The processing tends to add a purplish tint to skies, though. Detail levels are similar to the regular shots, and vivo seems to have taken care of the halos we observed around high-contrast areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X5Pro captures decent panoramas. When shot in portrait, the images are about 1,800 pixels tall and a 150-degree shot results in about 9 megapixels. Given the fairly low resolution, there's not all that much detail, but the stitching is very good, as is exposure. It would do just fine for social media.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Close-up shooting is possible with the X5Pro, but the phone tends to mislead you about acquiring focus on your subject - what you thought was a properly focused image on the display, turns out to be a bit blurry on the PC. The solution is to move a centimeter back from the closest you think it can focus and then shoot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro has an 8MP front cam, which takes 3,264 x 2,448 pixel images. Skin tones are rendered nicely, and although fine low-contrast detail in the hair is smeared, the photos are good overall, and will certainly make for fine album-sized prints.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro shoots standard-issue video up to 1080p/30fps (4K recording is not on the Snapdragon 615 specsheet). Additionally, there are slow motion and fast motion modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The regular 1080p mode creates videos with a bitrate of 16Mbps, and audio is recorded at 96Kbps. The video quality is a LOT better than the X5Max' output. Apparently vivo has addressed the mediocre video quality on the older model and the Pro now shoots nicely detailed FullHD videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the best in business you can read the text below the Viva logo on the gas station across the street, and the Pro is nearly there. Colors are on the warm side again, as in still images, and the narrow dynamic range is another shared feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast motion mode is called Fast video and shoots at the full 1080p resolution at four times the speed. Detail levels don't suffer and if you grab a screenshot of a regular and fast motion video, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we've provided an untouched sample, shot at 1080p@30fps (00:17min, 33MB) for download from our server.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A couple of browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro comes with Google Chrome as well as a custom browser. Its interface definitely looks nice, and like everything else in Funtouch, fits well into the general design outline. The tab selection interface is similar to a desktop browser and eats away screen estate, so it's great that it can be hidden with a toggle in the bottom left corner. The handy text mode will help cut down on data traffic, while night mode will reduce strain on your eyes in dark environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>vivo has also included Google Chrome in the mix. It is becoming the most popular mobile browser and should be fairly familiar. Thanks to your Google account, Chrome can sync the tabs you have open on other devices (desktops, tablets) with the phone. This feature also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites and can remember passwords and login data across different platforms.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Vivo has kept things pretty clean in terms of preloaded applications and, besides the nowadays obligatory Google suite, there is quite little preloaded software. Also, the things that are included in the mix are generally well executed, nicely styled and even, quite convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, Funtouch OS has an amazing central management hub, called iManager. It is designed to keep your phone in top shape and generally does a pretty good job of it. It can clean your RAM and storage on request and naturally manage applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the software goes beyond this and is quite clever. For one, it has access to some advanced hardware features on the X5Pro and can influence general performance and power-management through different modes. It also offers black-lists for both calls and messages and can even protect you from pesky applications. Once it detects that a certain app is requesting a permission it dubs kind of intrusive, it warns you with a popup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro comes with WPS Office preinstalled. It's a pretty powerful office editor that can handle Word docs, PDFs, Spreadsheets and Presentations. It can link to cloud storage, email files, and create a shared view with other users and more. There's editing enabled, too, so you can get some work done on the go, if need be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the other bundled apps have nothing really spectacular to offer, except, perhaps, slick looks. The calendar is straightforward. It can seamlessly sync with your google account and naturally has events, reminders and all of the standard week, month and daily views, but also a year view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we find that the feature-rich notes app. Entries can contain multimedia, as well as reminders, which get automatically entered into your calendar. The app even lets you doodle on screen for a quick note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other things that deserve a mention are the sound recorder and the calculator, which has a nice scientific view in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app has all the functionality you would expect. You can have multiple alarms each with its own repeat schedule, ringtone and snooze settings. A handy feature can alert a contact of your choice, should you ignore you alarm more than 5 times. There's also a world clock, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a very intuitive file manager. It automatically groups things according to type, but also allows traditional folder browsing, as well as searching. Multiple file operations are now possible too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>High-quality materials, great craftsmanship, phone feels expensive</paragraph>
			<paragraph>5.2-inch FullHD Super AMOLED is sharp and excels in direct sunlight, but is otherwise somewhat dim</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual-SIM dual-standby capability, otherwise average connectivity package</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Very good battery life in use, marred by only average standby times, hence the 67-hour endurance rating</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Funtouch OS is now based on Lollipop, but sees little change from previous iterations - it has its distinct take on Android, which may not be to everyone's taste, but offers plenty of customization. The extensive gesture support is nice once you get used to it</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Raw performance is well above average for the hardware, the X5Pro is certainly much better optimized than the Max, though it could be just the jump to Lollipop</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudspeaker posted a Good score</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pre-installed apps have you properly covered in terms of media consumption, and although the gallery is basic, the editor has a lot of options; the video player supports a wide range of codecs and the music player is straightforward and functional</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Solid audio quality, loud output, too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>13MP main camera renders a lot of detail, but also plenty of noise. Exposure is dependable, dynamic range is limited</paragraph>
			<paragraph>8MP selfie cam produces accurate skin tones, but its output is rather soft</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p video is well-detailed, but low in dynamic range; 10x fast motion mode is the same in quality and is genuinely useful; 1/4x slow motion is VGA only and is no good</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro's name is well deserved. There're phones in the X5 range that do stand out but few better all-round performers than the Pro. That may very well stand for Proficient. Seeing as how the chipset inside is only a midrange solution though, Professional may be a stretch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As has become customary with vivo handsets, the X5Pro is solidly built, with great selection of materials and top-notch execution. The initial visual resemblance to a certain California-designed device fades when you look at the vivo's glass back, but the premium feel remains.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sharp Super AMOLED display doesn't need to stay in the shade, though it could have been a little brighter. Battery life is on par with the larger X5Max, despite the smaller display and larger battery, but the X5Pro has been tuned towards performance and it shows in benchmarks. And the Max did surprisingly well in the endurance department to begin with, so the Pro earns high marks on longevity too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first obvious alternative to the vivo X5Pro is the company's own X5Max. You get a slightly larger screen and mostly the same hardware, but the Max is running KitKat, and that's likely where it'll remain. Its front camera is inferior too, but you do get one thing to brag about, it being the world's slimmest phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo has the R7 squarely aimed at the X5Pro. It has a similar dual-glass build, but is smaller at 5.0 inches. The same chipset powers the R7, but it has 3GB of RAM on board. It is, unfortunately, still running on KitKat, though Oppo has promised a Lollipop update. Or you could go for the R5, where you'd sacrifice battery life, but won't be losing in terms of style. Meanwhile, the upgraded R5s version comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage at a bargain price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A7 is another potential option, and one readily available on most markets, unlike the X5Pro. A bit larger, but lighter nonetheless, it has comparable battery life and raw performance, but a lower resolution front cam. These are so evenly matched, that the choice comes down to brand preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor 7 has a build to rival the X5Pro, but it opts for metal on the back. Its Kirin 935 chip has its flaws, but the 20MP camera is superior to the Pro's 13MP shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not unreasonable to go with an older-generation flagship at the X5Pro's asking price. The Sony Xperia Z2 will deliver more raw performance and it's famous for its battery life. You also get a higher resolution main camera, though 2.2MP selfies may not cut it. Alternatively, the LG G3 will give you more screen real estate in the same footprint, plus an optically stabilized 13MP camera. Again, Only 2.1MP on the front though. Both the Z2 and the G3 can shoot 2160p videos, while the X5Pro is capped at 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Certainly the most balanced member of the vivo X5 range, there's a lot to like in the X5Pro. It does a great job as a midrange smartphone, with solid performance across the board. The upmarket build, however, comes with the price tag to match, and the fierce competition in the segment may push it to the sidelines.</paragraph>
