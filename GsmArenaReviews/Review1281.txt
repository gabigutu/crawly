			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Amaze 4G is joining the über-smartphone ranks in the United States at a time, when the competition has reached its peak. The device is part of the first wave of smartphones, capable of reaching 42Mbps on T-Mobile?s HSDPA network. It was launched simultaneously with the Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile and shares quite a few internal components with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the HTC launched the Amaze 4G, we couldn?t help but wonder why would T-Mobile offer yet another top of the line HTC smartphone, given the fact that the magenta colored carrier already has the Sensation 4G on its shelves. It turns out however, that the newcomer has quite a few extra tricks up the sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 chipset, a gig of RAM and an improved 8MP snapper, which offers the whopping two hardware buttons, there is a lot of new kit in the Amaze 4G, compared to the Sensation. The camera alone is loaded with features, including a handful of shooting modes which can put a lot of point and shoot snappers to shame. All in all, there are plenty of novelties in the smartphone to spark our interest, so we?re not going to waste time, and hop straight on its key features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can notice above, the HTC Amaze 4G shares some components with the Sensation 4G, while improving its main weaknesses such as adding a camera shutter, more built-in storage memory, NFC connectivity and finally, doing away with the notorious death grip issue. This is not a surprise. HTC has a good record of listening to its users? feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big question with the latest smartphone offering from Taiwan is how it will fare against the rest of the competition. There is an iPhone 4S out there, and it?s selling like hot cakes. Samsung has not one, but three Galaxy S II versions in the United States, including one on T-Mobile with the same chipset as the Amaze 4G. With so much competition out there, the margin for error is small. Let?s see how the metal-clad handset will fare on our test course. As always, we?ll kick things off with an unboxing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The HTC Amaze 4G is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bare minimum retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We really wish there was more to say about the retail package of the HTC Amaze 4G. Unfortunately, all you?re going to find in it is a charger and a USB cable. Oh yes, there are some booklets as well and that?s about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no headphones included in the box, nor a microSD card. What?s particularly bothering about this occurrence is that it is slowly becoming a trend not just with HTC, but other manufacturers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first thing you feel the moment you take the HTC Amaze 4G in your hand is the cold metal. The smartphone is hands-down, one of the best made handsets in terms of materials and finish out there. It is a blend of aluminum, the HTC signature soft feel plastic, and Corning Gorilla Glass. The latter covers the entire front of the device, along with its edges which stick out about 1mm above the metal bezel on the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The measures of the Amaze 4G are 130 x 65.6 x 11.8 mm, and its weight comes at 173 grams. The device is definitely hefty but, given the materials used on it, for a good reason. There surely will be plenty of people out there, willing to sacrifice weight for build quality. Just ask the Vertu crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to its chipset relative, the T-Mobile Galaxy S II, the HTC Amaze 4G is slightly thicker and a lot heavier. Interestingly enough however, it is more pocket friendly due to its smaller screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gorilla Glass covered 4.3? S-LCD display of the HTC Amaze 4G is already quite familiar to us. It is the same qHD (540 x 960 pixels) unit as in the HTC Sensation. The display performs well except when it is under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can notice in the picture above, the S-LCD unit of the Amaze 4G looks well on its own, but pales in comparison to the Galaxy S II?s Super AMOLED Plus unit. The viewing angles and contrast levels don?t come even close to the Samsung?s offering. The higher qHD resolution partially offsets this, but, we believe, a lot of people will be easily drawn to the Super AMOLED Plus screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, we have the proximity and ambient light sensors to the left of the earpiece and the VGA video call camera on the right. Under the earpiece grill hides a small status LED (on the right). It is interesting to note here, that the earpiece grille is flat, unlike what we have been seeing lately from HTC offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen, we find four capacitive keys. The haptic enabled controls are well spaced and very responsive. The keys (Home, Menu, back and search) have extra functionality upon a long-press (task switcher, virtual keyboard, voice search).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Amaze 4G, you will find the uncovered microUSB port which is also used for charging of the battery. You can note how the screen is slightly elevated from the metal bezel of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things get much busier on the right side of the device. There, you will find the volume rocker, as well as the couple of dedicated camera buttons. The smaller one serves solely the camcorder. This is a welcome addition to the hardware department of the HTC Amaze 4G, and a drastic improvement over the lack of any hardware camera buttons in the case of the Sensation 4G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the 3.5mm audio jack (left uncovered) and the Power/Lock key, which is easy enough to press when you want but secure against accidental taps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece. There's also a small latch that lets you pop the phone out of its back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the smartphone, you will find the 8MP camera with its dual-LED flash right below it. The loudspeaker is also nested there ? on the right side of the camera. The picture is on the back is completed by a lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the phone?s cover is the place where some of the biggest changes in the HTC Amaze 4G, compared to the HTC Sensation took place. Remember the death grip issues which the latter had? They?re gone here thanks to the installation of the device?s antennas in the plastic parts of the back. This is actually the reason why plastic has been used in the phone?s body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card is hot-swappable as long as you have the back of the device removed. The SIM card is blocked by the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Amaze 4G packs a solid 1730 mAh battery. The phone lasted easily through a day of moderate use which included about an hour of phone calls and music playback, some web-browsing and video game play. In case you are a smartphone junkie like we are, we strongly suggest that you carry a charger with you. A second battery with a dedicated charger is also a neat option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the HTC Amaze 4G is one of the most solid devices out there. It is so well put together, that it is easy to forget that the device goes a bit on the heavy side. Given the materials used, you can at least see where the weight has gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is easily distinguishable as an HTC device, which will be great for the brand?s loyal followers. The change in the design of the earpiece however, gives you a hint that what you are looking is new.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Amaze 4G felt great when held in hand. Once again, the credit for this goes to the premium materials used in the phone. We hope that the competition will take a note here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface: Android Gingerbread and Sense 3.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Amaze 4G runs Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread with Sense 3.0 out of the box. There is nothing revolutionary here ? we?ve seen the UI implemented in the Sensation 4D as well as the EVO 3D. You can see it in action on video below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We begin our tour of the user interface with the lockscreen. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone or drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s not the end of it - the HTC Amaze 4G comes with six different lockscreens preinstalled. You can access the others from the Personalize menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default homescreen just shows the ring, four shortcuts, the time and the homescreen wallpaper. Then there's the Photo album lockscreen, which tosses photos from your gallery in cool 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the Friend Stream widget which shows SNS updates from your friends and the Weather widget, which shows off the Sense UI's cool weather animations. There's Stocks too - with quotes flying up or down, again, in eye-pleasing 3D. Finally, there's the Clock lockscreen which shows a bigger clock - you can pick any of the 11 clock widgets you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going further than the lockscreen reveals the Sense homescreen. There, we meet a scroll arc at the bottom that is just an indication of which homescreen pane you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s Leap view instead - tap the home key (while on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreen panes are all you get ? there?s no add or delete option ? it will come with Sense 3.5. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense comes with HTC proprietary Scenes ? essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes (older Sense versions prompted you to save modifications as a new scene) and you can get more scenes off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but the customization goes deep ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper and use different colors for various UI elements. They can also replace the standard dock, lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetically, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There's a list layout, where two-finger alphabet scrolling is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? All apps, Frequent and Favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of items to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget, you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are seventeen different clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Twitter widget, for instance, shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet/update status. The other version is more compact and only allows status updates and tweets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the bottom of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second "button" is Remove, which deletes the widget as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. A press and hold of the Home button works too. The notification area is tabbed too - the second tab has toggles for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings and the last line shows used/free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard task switcher, you get a task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are fresh off testing the Snapdragon S3 chipset?s performance from the HTC Amaze 4G?s counterpart ? the T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S II, and we found it to be no slouch. In the case of the subject of our review, the 1.5GHz dual-core Scorpion CPUs performed in a similar fashion, except for the Quadrant and Antutu benchmarks. The Amaze 4G scored lower on them, most likely due to its higher screen resolution. See the benchmarks below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly enough, the HTC Amaze 4G got the highest score we?ve seen to date on the Vellamo browser benchmark. It handily beat all Samsung Galaxy S II versions by some margin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We all know by now that benchmarks are mostly reserved for bragging rights. That said, we found the HTC Amaze 4G to be quite zippy and lag free when handling its daily tasks. One would have to be seriously picky to complain about the device?s speed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual Sense-d phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Amaze 4G has HTC?s all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just the first tab ? the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages between you and the given contact in a conversation layout. The third tab is a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs are what turns the Amaze 4G into a powerful networking tool. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). The HTC Amaze 4G has both Smart Dialing and Voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device knows some accelerometer-based tricks ? turning the phone over will mute the ringer of an incoming call while placing it down starts the loudspeaker automatically when you are in the middle of a call. The other feature is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-call quality of the device is great. A secondary mic is there to make sure none of the ambient noise gets to your calling party and improves the in-call quality noticeably.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is fully covered as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Amaze 4G is capable of handling all sorts of text messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is bigger and covers nearly half of the screen in landscape mode. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input is covered by the on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. While it?s still not as good as a hardware one, it?s the next best thing ? the 4.3? screen has enough real estate for big, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit. In case this one doesn?t cut it for you, the Android Market is full of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. It is easy to set up and quite functional.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Not your plain vanilla Android gallery is just as cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC gallery stacks photos like the vanilla Android gallery does, but sans the 3D-ish effect. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution. You can also select which folders the gallery should display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo is straightforward ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube. You could use DLNA to push photos to your compatible TV too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also perform some basic picture editing actions within the gallery such as crop, apply effects, and rotate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Amaze 4G supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A DivX enabled video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the videos subfolder in the Gallery or from the Videos shortcut in the menu, they launch the same thing. There's no dedicated video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files are displayed as a grid and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr, even apps like Dropbox if you have it installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC Sensation offers a full screen toggle (stretch / crop video to fit the screen) and you can scrub through videos. SRS sound enhancement is also available but there?s no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does OK in general - 1080p MP4 videos were no problem. The player handled some 720p DivX or XviD videos. However, it was picky about which videos it would play and which it wouldn?t - especially when dealing with HD clips or large files. There's no MKV or subtitle support either, which was disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes handy too ? the Sensation can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the MHL port too - if you have the proper adapter, you can hook up your HDTV using an HDMI cable. The Sensation needs some work in this department though, if we're to accept it as a proper portable HD video player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Amaze-ing music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased (at least our unit had, which featured a Vodafone music shop).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dropdown at the top of the screen lets you switch between your library on the phone and DLNA media servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device offers SRS sound enhancement to boost the listening experience. If you plug in headphones, you can change equalizer settings too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. Other goodies include looking up a song on YouTube or updating the album art for the current or all songs. You can enable auto update too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the bar at the top of the screen that says "HTC Amaze 4G" lets you play the song on another device wirelessly - either over DLNA or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a neat feature - a 3D card stays on the lockscreen that lets you control the music player (previous, next and play/pause). The card also shows the album art and name of the song and artist. You can flip the card - it's backside shows album art and track info too, but lacks music controls. That's not particularly useful but is good eye candy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There is an FM radio too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that annoyed us about the radio is that it takes quite a while to start and stop ? about five seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found no complaints with the audio output of the Amaze 4G. It is on par with the best offerings currently on the market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>A solid 8MP shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Amaze 4G packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels and records 1080p video @ 30fps. There?s a dual-LED flash / video light too. The camera unit has backside illuminated sensor and wide aperture lens (f/2.2) for better low light performance. Face detection is on board as well, along with some special shooting modes such as HDR and sweep panorama.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is space efficient. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. There?s a virtual zoom lever on the left. By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off (note that cropping to 16:9 reduces the output resolution to less than 8MP).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can focus either by touching the screen, or with a half-press of the dedicated camera button. Geotagging is on board as well. When focusing, the camera unit makes a sound, suggesting it means business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of the Amaze 4G has zero shutter lag. The speed with which it takes shots is nothing short of impressive. It loads fast too ? you can either access it from the lockscreen, or by long pressing the dedicated button. The process takes less than a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to boost the camera performance, HTC has added a handful of modes to select from. Along with the Auto mode, which selects the optimal settings in the current conditions, there is also SmartShot, SweepShot, ClearShot HDR, BurstShot, Night, Action, Macro, Portrait, and Manual. The latter allows you to modify the advanced settings yourself. With so many shooting modes, the HTC Amaze 4G looks poised to put even some point-and-shoot cameras to shame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BurstShot mode helps you take 5 consecutive pictures in a short time interval. It is handy when you are shooting a sports event of a fast-moving object.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the bold promises, the Amaze 4G is not among the best 8 megapixel shooters we've seen. Its photos have a lot of noise, even on a sunny day. The noise reduction keeps the visible noise down to an acceptable level, but at the expense of the fine detail. The dynamic range is also nothing spectacular resulting in frequently overblown highlights in mid- to high-contrast scenes. Macros turn out good but again, the fine detail suffers from the noise reduction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color reproduction is faithful but the white balance sometimes gets things off. The camera lens seems quite susceptible to lens flare with immensely deteriorates contrast in shots that have some sort of a bright light source in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a number of camera samples. Check them out below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos shot with the built-in HDR mode are not as seamlessly fused as we would have liked, but it does its job well. The only artifacts we noticed were present along high-contrast edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SweepShot is what HTC calls its Panorama mode. It's really easy to shoot a Panorama image with it. The sweeping movement of the camera is assisted by an on-screen indicator, which guides you along and helps with the framing. And the result... As you'll see blow, the image quality is nothing spectacular but besides the somewhat awkward perspective distortion, the phone has done a great job in stitching it. There are almost no stitching artifacts and the exposure is nice and even throughout the frame.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The full HD camcorder is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the still camera, the camcorder has its dedicated hardware shutter button. It is slightly smaller and has a thin red line on top of it, suggesting you its purpose. It works quite nice too. The moment you press it and the camera starts shooting video. We are yet to see such a feature on another smartphone on the US market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Amaze 4G video quality is quite nice actually. The colors and contrast are nice, the action turns out smooth and there?s plenty of detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot in MP4 format. The Amaze 4G camera boasts stereo audio recording at 44kHz, which is a huge improvement over the sub-22kHz mono sound that, say, the LG Optimus 2X or Samsung Galaxy S II record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have prepared a couple of camera samples for you. Don't forget to click 1080p on the Full HD video sample and open the video full screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has all you need and some more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Amaze 4G has a complete connectivity set. This department benefits the most from the presence of the new Snapdragon S3 chipset. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and blazing fast dual-band 3G: 42Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink thanks to HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Connected media app handles all sorts of DLNA connections ? it plays media to and from devices on the network with just a couple of clicks. Apps like the gallery have such functionality built in too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computer?s Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive now have big, thumb-friendly icons, which is great since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support 1 to 8 devices (default Froyo app maxes out at 5), you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable ?allowed users? only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not over covering the connectivity - the "microUSB port" as we called it for convenience is actually a MHL port. If you plug a MHL dongle in it, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV - the qHD resolution has the perfect 16:9 aspect ratio for connecting to HDTVs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icing on the connectivity cake is the NFC capability. The credit for it goes, once again, to the new chipset of the HTC Amaze 4G. Much like with the T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S II, there is a dedicated app, called Tags, in charge of handling the NFC functionality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is excellent as expected<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Amaze 4G has the latest Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread web browser, plenty of processing power and a large, high-res screen. The Vellamo benchmark result already gave us a hint about the serious performance on tap in this department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are back and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out even more options ? stuff like find on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone?s browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes even longer texts extremely easy to read on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Amaze 4G has full Flash support and YouTube videos up to 720p played quite smoothly. 1080p however proves too much for the browser and the video gets choppy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A top notch organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Amaze 4G, with a mobile Office app to boot that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word and Excel documents but not 2007 docs. Oddly, you can edit existing Office 2007 docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files. The on-screen keyboard does cut down the available space in half but if you zoom out you can still fit a reasonable amount of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This version of Polaris gives less editing options than we're used to - you can do copy, cut and paste, then apply bold, italic and underline styles and highlight text and that's it. There used to be font style options here but now they're inexplicably gone. You can't edit formulas in Excel spreadsheets either, which is a major stumbling block for doing Office document editing on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has five different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Amaze 4G features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Desk clock app turns your Sensation into a? well, Desk clock. It displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. You can use the Stocks lockscreen too. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an HTC-branded flashlight app too ? it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To top everything off, there is also a Zinio eBook reader preinstalled. It required you to set up an account and offers both books and magazines. The interface is simple and intuitive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market keeps getting better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.5GHz dual-core CPU and a powerful GPU, the HTC Amaze 4G can run every Android app designed for phones. The OS version is 2.3.4 so you won?t have any problems on that account either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After its recent major overhaul, the Android Market has become the place to go not only for apps and media, but also book, movies, etc. Its interface is simple and intuitive. The search function at the bottom right corner will assist you in finding anything you can possibly need.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps will help you find your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Amaze 4G has full integration with HTCSense.com on board. We have covered it extensively in the past. You can take a look at it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To wrap up our software overview of the Amaze 4G, we must note that, once again, the device is loaded with a number of useless proprietary apps from T-Mobile. We certainly hope that this trend will go away in the future.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Amazing build quality, premium materials, nicely performing camera, speedy CPU and network connectivity ? there?s a lot to like in the HTC Amaze 4G. Its name appears to be well justified. We did however find the battery life to be less than perfect. Its screen is also trailing the market leaders despite its high resolution. There is simply more than just pixels out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Amaze 4G is priced at $259.99 with a two-year-contract on T-Mobile?s network, and after a $50 mail-in-rebate. In short, you will have to shell out close to $350 to get a hold of the device once all the applicable taxes are factored in. This is quite a lot of change even for a top of the line smartphone, which the Amaze 4G undoubtedly is. Let?s see what else this sort of money can get you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We must kick things off with the Motorola Droid RAZR. The device was launched barely hours ago for Verizon Wireless, and comes with serious set of features. It the case of the Motorola RAZR, it is not the dual-core CPU and the gig of RAM that capture the attention. It slimmest ever body on a smartphone (for the most part of it), the ultra-premium materials used, and the 4.3? Super AMOLED screen. LTE connectivity on board makes the package even more attractive. At $299.99 the RAZR is poised to blow the HTC offering out of the water and for a good reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola DROID RAZR</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 4S is also gunning for the potential HTC Amaze 4G users. With seriously upgraded internals and a lower price tag for the 16GB version, it is a seriously enticing option provided you?re not stuck on Android as the mobile platform of your choice. The iPhone 4S starts at $199.99, and is available at AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon Wireless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 4S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The U.S. Samsung Galaxy S II trio is also in the mix. The AT&amp;T and Sprint Wireless versions pack the highly revered and beastly Exynos chipset. The T-Mobile version has the same Snapdragon S3 as the HTC Amaze 4G, but in a significantly lighter body. Its 4.52? Super AMOLED Plus screen is also significantly better than the HTC?s S-LCD offering. It is worth opting for it despite its lower resolution. The AT&amp;T and Sprint Galaxy S II versions will set you back $199.99, while the T-Mobile one goes for $229.99. Keep in mind that the Sprint Galaxy S II is a CDMA flavored model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S II for AT&amp;T ? Samsung Epic 4G Touch ? Samsung Galaxy S II for T-Mobile</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sensation 4G and EVO 3D are also serious alternatives to the Amaze 4G. The former should become even more attractive, as we expect its price to drop now that another HTC flagship has been introduced. Currently, the smartphones are priced at 199.99 on T-Mobile and Sprint networks respectively. Due to fact that they?ve been out for a while however, you can easily pick one up from an authorized reseller at a serious discount.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Sensation 4G ? HTC EVO 3D</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, we have to point out that the Samsung Galaxy Nexus is also around the corner. It promises a loaded spec sheet and Google?s latest and greatest Android version. Rumor has it, that it will be priced at $299.99 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see above, most alternatives out there are priced lower than the HTC Amaze 4G, save for the Motorola Droid RAZR. The spec sheet of the latter however, justifies its tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is hard to find any faults in the HTC Amaze 4G. The phone is a great performer and it offers top notch build quality. We do however, feel that it should have been launched several months ago, when the competition was not so intense. While we?re sure that the hardcore HTC fans will love it, we can?t say the same about potential new users. There are just way too many options out there which simply offer more for you hard earned money.</paragraph>
