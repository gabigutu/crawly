			<paragraph>Motorola keeps reusing its trustworthy old RAZR V3 design in almost all of its current models. Probably most of the users will agree that this is not a bad thing at all, as those are one of the finest, most beautiful phones on the market. RAZR maxx V6 is no exception to the rule.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Longer, thicker and heavier than the original V3 RAZR, the maxx V6 is a completely different story. It boasts HSDPA (3.5G), EDGE, stereo Bluetooth, 2 megapixel camera, memory card, a larger display and very modern design. So, the V3 just cannot compete. But there is another phone on the market which we can easily put next to the Motorola RAZR maxx V6 and that is Samsung Z560. Equipped with almost the same functions and extras, those two phones are major opponents.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The typical slim-shell<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With its dimensions of 104 x 53 x 15 mm and weight of 105 g, Motorola RAZR maxx V6 gets a place in the perfect middle of size and weight for a high-end clamshell phones. The Samsung Z560 is a bit smaller and weighs less but if we look at them in terms of design, the new Moto surely gets more applause. We can't practically think of any fault in the design of the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>As hard as it can be<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone's plastic and metal construction is very nice and solid. It did not produce and creaks or plays and its clamshell closing mechanism works just perfect with a very recognizable sound when you close the flip. As in most of the cases with clamshell 3G phones, the video calls camera is in the middle of the construction and is visible only when the flip is open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the closed phone has a great 65K colors display and above it is the 2 megapixel camera with two LED flash. Just beneath the display are the touch sensitive keys which serve as music control. There are the Play/Pause, Forward and Backward functions. Below them there is a Motorola logo and when the phone rings, the logo glows in blue accompanied by glowing blue lines on both sides of the display. Those light effects are really nice and add a nice feel to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The front side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone hosts the battery cover with a silver Motorola logo on it and the loudspeaker below it. Under the cover you may find the Motorola BZ60 Li-Ion battery with capacity of 940 mAh, which according to the manufacturer will last for 375 hours in stand-by mode and 3 hours of talk time. Regrettably, we can't comment on those figures as we used the phone heavily and the battery performance in normal every-day will prove different. Besides the battery, under the battery cover you will also see the memory card slot. It is hot-swappable but you have to remove the cover first. The SIM card bed is under the battery as you may have guessed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Motorola V6 back panel ? battery cover off ? SIM card bed ? battery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the clamshell has dual volume key on it and a button which opens a simple menu on the external display which controls some basic functions. A USB port is located on the left side. It is the usual miniUSB port that Motorola puts in almost all of its models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Left side of the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side features a camera release button and an eyelet for a wrist strap. The top and bottom sides of the body are bare.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>When opened, the phone reveals its fantastic 2.2" 256K colors TFT display with resolution of 240 x 320 pixels. Above it are the speaker grills and a Motorola logo. The other part of the open phone consists of the keypad. Between the two parts, in the joint, is the VGA video calls camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Texters won't complain<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of V6 is rather comfortable and can be easily distinguished is the dark only by touching the keys. It is made of two parts, as most modern phones nowadays, functional and numeric. The functional part has two soft keys on the very top, the 4-way navigation D-pad with confirming center in the middle and 5 more buttons surrounding it: on the left, a video calls initiating button and the green "receiver" button; on the right, correction C button and the red "receiver" button. Below the navigation circle is button which activates the internet browser of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> V6 keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric part of the keypad is standard - the lines of keys have a slight uplift which enhances touch control. The backlighting of the keypad is great and it evenly illuminates the whole keypad in a blue color.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Joy for the eyes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2.2" TFT display, capable of showing up to 256K colors and resolution of 240 x 320 pixels is really great. It shows vivid colors on a big surface. The picture is very clear and the only drawback is legibility under direct sunlight. In certain light conditions, it may be very hard to see what is on the display. Other than that - supreme! The backlighting is very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The Motorola maxx V6 display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external display is also of the better ones. It can display up to 65K colors and has resolution of 120 x 160 pixels which is quite good for such a small surface. It shows the time, chosen wallpaper, the battery and signal bars and the caller id or number if someone is calling. It can also display the currently played song and a progress bar. Quite nice, indeed!</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The external display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Signal reception is as good as in every phone coming out on the market in the past few years. In these days, nobody can afford to have a phone with bad reception. The speaker quality is also good; no strange noises can be heard during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Light effects and external display view when receiving a call ? Missed call alert on the external display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an airplane mode which switches off the phone features and gives you the option to play music or games where you cannot use your cellular phone regularly. There is even an option that asks you every time if you want the phone to start in airplane mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Aeroplane mode ? Startup question on the main and on the external display</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New, but still the same<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are familiar with the old Motorola interface called Synergy, the one used in V3, you will not be very surprised with this new baby's user interface as it is almost the same. On the stand-by screen you will find the battery and signal bars, the operator name, the time and date and according to your preference you can put a cross with the applications assigned to the four ways of the navigation D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Stand-by screen with and without the cross with applications ? external display stand-by</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you get into the main menu you will see a grid of 4 x 3 animated icons. The sub-menus are in list view with small icons on the left side or in text lists only. This feature is not user-configurable. The phone speed in the menu and most of the applications is not the best it could be but it is alright. There are three graphic themes available: Disco, Glow and Indium.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Storing contacts is what it's all about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola RAZR maxx V6 phonebook can store up to 1000 contacts (much like the competing Samsung Z560). You can view the phonebook in two ways: as a list with thumbnails or as a plaint text list. You may assign different field to an entry, such as First name, Last Name, Nickname, Number, Type( Mobile, Home, Work, Fax, Pager, Other) Video number, Email (type - personal, work, other), URL, Postal Address (type: home, work, other), Category, Rinder ID (Sound, Music, Voice Notes, Vibration Pattern, Silent, None), Picture, Birthday, Notes. Probably that is more than anybody would ever want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  List with thumbnails ? plain list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can show either SIM contacts only, the phone contacts only or both. You may also create a new Message list or Email list with contacts you often send messages to. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Choosing the contacts' source</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The log of * and #<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Recent Calls application shows all 50 missed, received and dialed calls. God bless Motorola for finally understanding that navigation between different types of calls can be much easier with the use of the asterisk and hash keys (? &amp; #). When you press either of those keys you switch between the different groups of calls. This function was put in the Motorola phones long ago but it didn't serve the Calls application.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Texting and emails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola RAZR maxx V6 has the standard messaging menu, meaning Inbox for text and multimedia messages and a separate inbox for the emails. The SMS editor has iTap to assist the typing and counts down the characters before exceeding the 160 limit. It also shows the amount of separate messages that will be sent if you exceed 160 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Message Centre ? SMS editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email application supports POP3, SMTP and IMAP4 protocols. It can also download attachments easily. You can set the phone to download the headers only or the entire emails.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music is in the air<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports MP3, AAC, AAC+ music formats and plays rather well music files. The player offers repeat and shuffle options, bass boost and spatial width control. It handles playlists effortlessly. The touch sensitive keys on the front of the phone are quite hard to use, as they do not react every time they are touched. Sometimes they even response without being touched or after a long delay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Playing a song ? in the background ? music setup ? choosing what to play</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides that, the music player shows song progress on the external display if you decide to play the music in the background. The video player offers almost the same options as the music player and it can play the movies in fullscreen, meaning landscape mode. The Samsung Z560 can also play video in fullscreen but doesn't support landscape mode. On the other hand a landscape mode is not a much needed feature on a clamshell handset since it is uncomfortable to hold it sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Showing the song on the external display ? Playing a video ? in landscape view ? video options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 50 MB internal memory and a microSD memory card slot available so you can store your music without difficulty and access it at any time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola maxx V6 features a 2 megapixel camera with basic set of options. You can select the resolution and compression, switch the LED flash on/off (don't expect miracles) or use the self-portrait option. The camera lacks autofocus; anything closer than, say, 60 cm from the lens will be out of focus. The digital zoom works by cropping a portion of the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Shooting with Motorola RAZR maxx</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the photos is about average for a 2 megapixel camera. The HSDPA rival Samsung Z560 overall has a better camera mainly because of the autofocus and the wider dynamic range (we've got less overexposure from the Samsung). However, we noticed that during the testing we ended up with more "keepers" from the Motorola maxx, because we didn't have to rely on and wait for the slow autofocus. Please note, that the presented photo samples are losslessly rotated for your convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera viewfinder ? Zooming in and out ? camera options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>            Sample camera photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In video mode the camera captures video at QCIF (176 x 144 pixels) resolution in 3GP format. We find that resolution pretty low for today's standards so we won't be showing you any video samples.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3.5G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola RAZR maxx V6 has 3G connectivity and can handle video calls. When starting a video call, the VGA camera is used to capture your image and send it to the other side. You can see your image in a small window under the main window which shows the opposite side's image. But HSDPA means more than video calls. It supports data transfers up to 3.6 Mbps which means you can browse the web really fast. The competing Samsung Z560 supports downlink speeds of up to 1.8 Mbps but that's ok since not many mobile networks support the 3.6Mbps standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it seems speed will be all that matters with HSDPA-handsets becoming more and more popular in and wide spread in 2007. So we decided to conduct a little speed challenge of our own. We set up a MP3 file online which was 4MB in size or exactly 4,263,772 bytes. Then we downloaded it using several handsets in order to compare download speeds. Here are the results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> UMTS &amp; HSDPA speed test</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If one looks at the download speeds which we have listed here, they may notice that the UMTS download speeds are closer to their theoretical maximum than the HSDPA speeds. A possible explanation might be that the bottleneck for HSDPA data transfers in the end will turn out to be the pure write speed of the device itself than any other thing. A possible reason for the lack of difference between the download speeds of the Samsung Z560 and Motorola RAZR maxx V6 is the network limitation at 1.8 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola maxx V6 also has GPRS and EDGE both Class 10 support so when you are in a place with no 3G signal, you can always switch to slower GPRS or EDGE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For short distance communication, Motorola have included Bluetooth and USB support. The Bluetooth supports the A2DP profile which means that you can listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headphones. You can synchronize your phone with a PC seamlessly using USB or Bluetooth. You can also synchronize with a remote server using the MOTOSYNC application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Connectivity options ? Synchronization</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Opera 8<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This clamshell comes equipped with Opera 8 browser which can open most of the web pages out there. It handles Javascript and Flash and has zoom in and out features. Regrettably, there is no landscape mode, which is a pity considering the large display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Business is crucial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the Tools menu you will find Calculator, Calendar, Alarm Clock, Dialing Services (Fixed Dial, Service Dial), Activation List, Voice message and World Clock applications. The Calculator is a basic one. The Calendar has four views: month, week, day and organized events view. You can create a new event and set various option: subject, location, event type and repeat options (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, none).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Tools menu ? Month, week and day view of the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Organized events in the calendar ? creating a new event</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm Clock application enables you to create alarms with names and reminders. Multiple alarms are available too. Voice recording is limited by the free memory only. The World Clock application displays the time in several different time zones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Calculator ? Alarm Clock ? Voice recorder</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Media Finder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another application we did not mention earlier is the Media Finder which is something like a gallery. It handles your media files like music, videos and pictures. When browsing through the pictures, the phone shows you lower quality thumbnails in order to make navigation faster. If you stop on a picture, it clarifies and becomes the full quality image. The Media Finder is a substitute for the file manager and we have to admit that it works great. We would like to see it more often in future Motorola handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Filtering pictures ? Thumbnail view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only two games in the phone are Block Breaker Deluxe and Platinum Sudoku. The first one is rather amusing; the goal is to break the entire block on the screen with the ball without letting it fall. There is no need to tell you what the Sudoku is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Block Breaker Deluxe ? Platinum Sudoku</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other applications in the phone include BACKUP, eBay Pocket Auctions, HELPMEMOTO, Motorola SETUP and Motorola TEXT. The first two need no introduction. HELPMEMOTO is a tutorial of the phone. Motorola SETUP is for setting MMS and Internet options easily. Motorola TEXT is for backing up text messages.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you want a stylish clamshell with 3G, a good camera and various features - Motorola RAZR maxx V6 is your best choice. You can also consider the Samsung Z560, those two are really similar. In our team's opinion, the Motorola is slightly better in almost all aspects and it surely deserves the praises. At first we were skeptic as some of the recent Motorola phones we reviewed were disappointing and we didn't expected much from RAZR maxx V6, but it turned out great and we can surely advise anyone who wants a HSDPA clamshell to go straight ahead and get one of those beauties.</paragraph>
