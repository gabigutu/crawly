			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, previously in the GSMArena shopping guide... No, seriously, as promised. We're back with our picks and, hopefully, just on time for your holiday shopping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is the second edition of our guide and oh how things have changed. For one, feature phones had to go - smartphones now start as low as ?40 and you can buy any ?20 dumbphone with your eyes closed (they all do the same thing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other end of the spectrum are flagships that have dropped in price in the lull before the holidays. And it's not just budget phones and flagships - we're splitting up the guide by price category, starting with sub-?100 handsets and going all the way to the very best devices available in stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the price categories we're looking at:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, the ?200-?300 bracket seems to have some of the most attractive packages around but with the sub-?200 Moto G hitting the market, the demands placed on a sub-?200 phone are suddenly quite high - a year ago, the Moto G would have had close to flagship status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we jump in, a word on the technical terms, which we know can sound scary and confusing. In terms of computing power, a dual-core processor is passable, but entry level phones make do with just one core (there are only a few of those in this guide though). Dual-core Krait or quad-core anything is as good as a promise of solid performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For screens, anything under 200ppi is pretty poor (screens on budget phones usually), 200-300ppi is good but not great and anything over 300ppi is eye-popping quality and differences get near impossible to spot. For cameras, you want at least 5MP for stills and 720p for video, though budget phones settle for 3 or less megapixel stills and VGA video (4:3 DVD-like video).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that we're looking at off-contract prices. On-contract devices come cheap but get you saddled with an expensive plan for a year or two, which masks the true price of the device. Besides, carrier subsidies vary across markets, so we can't really provide information that will be relevant to everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also omitted any phones with limited market availability, as we want to make sure that you'll actually be able to buy the phones listed here, rather than just read about them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Under &#x20ac;100<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last time around, there were a few feature phones that made the cut for people on a shoe-string budget, but the cheapest smartphone is currently at &#x20ac;40 - and it's an LG rather than a no-brand to boot. There's still a sliver of market share for feature phones as dual-SIM smartphones are pricier than basic, dual-SIM feature phones. But again, there's nothing to recommend there, just grab the first one that's within your budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dual-SIM phones are still very popular in markets where carriers keep prices high and the sub-&#x20ac;100 category will be of interest to people in those locations. Lucky for them, Android's support for dual-SIM (unlike WP8) and drive to reduce prices have resulted in phones with very agreeable prices. We just want to remind you that we've excluded regional brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first phone is the LG Optimus L3. It didn't make the cut last time, the cheapest smartphone on offer was the Samsung Galaxy Y, but a big price drop for the L3 earns it the privilege of being the first phone we recommend in this edition of our shopping guide. It's also the phone that lead us to discard the feature phones - it's cheaper than a touchscreen Nokia Asha but you get better hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L3 launched early last year and while its specs are unimpressive, it's a perfectly adequate package. It runs Android 2.3.6 Gingerbread on an 800MHz processor with 384MB RAM. The 3.2" QVGA (240 x 320) touchscreen isn't a top pick either. What it has going for it is a 3.15MP camera capable of VGA @ 24fps video capture, expandable storage and a decent 1,500mAh battery. That's enough to handle music player and IM/Facebook duties. It will also do voice-guided navigation with Google Maps Drive in a pinch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Feature phones will never get Snapchat or the next craze in messaging and they don't have GPS navigation. If you've never had a smartphone, something like the Optimus L3 can open your eyes to new uses for your phone, without a big investment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, the Nokia Lumia 520 is making a comeback. It is the cheapest phone you can buy with a 4" WVGA (480 x 800) screen and dual-core Krait. It's also the only phone with a decent 5MP/720p camera in this price bracket. Add free offline navigation for one country, free Nokia Mix Radio streaming (with offline buffering) and free Office suite, and you get the perfect budget phone for people on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that in the US, the Lumia 520 can be had dirt cheap from the Microsoft store (off contract but locked to AT&amp;T). It's pricier in Europe, but a recent price drop moved it from the &#x20ac;100- &#x20ac;200 bracket to the sub- &#x20ac;100 category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel One Touch T'Pop is not much more expensive than an Optimus L3, but offers tangible improvements - and some drawbacks, unfortunately. The major plus is the bigger 3.5" screen with double the resolution (HVGA, 320 x 480, like all pre-4 iPhones). It also has a slightly faster CPU, but only 256MB RAM. The camera is either 2MP or 3.2MP depending on the region and there's a microSD card. Again, the key gain here is the better screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its cousin, the Alcatel One Touch S'Pop is the first dual-SIM phone on our list and, while it's similar to the T'Pop in some respects, it's actually a much better device. It keeps the 3.5" HVGA screen and 1GHz Cortex-A9 CPU, but has 512MB of RAM, runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean (a reasonably recent OS) and the camera is fixed at 3.15MP with VGA video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more up-to-date software version brings better app compatibility, which is very important if you plan to keep the phone for over two years (Gingerbread market share is shrinking and with that, the incentive for devs to support it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then comes a third member of the Alcatel One Touch family, the M'Pop. It bears many similarities to the Lumia 520 with one key difference - the chipset is much weaker (single-core Cortex-A9 CPU, PowerVR SGX531, basically an iPhone 3GS grade chipset). The upside is a decent 4" WVGA (480 x 800) display, Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and 5MP camera capable of 720p video capture. Keep in mind you don't get free SatNav, the chipset is lower grade and it only has 4GB of built-in storage rather than 8GB (there's a microSD card slot though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Usually we'd go with the Lumia for that Snapdragon chipset and free navigation, but Android offers a lot of opportunity for tinkering, if you're into that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>?100-?200<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This category will probably see the most converts from feature phones - and quite possibly the biggest turnover too. This category is also home to one of the most rebellious phones we've seen recently - the Moto G. It's a phone that last year would have had near flagship status, so phones in the vicinity of ?200 can no longer use "affordable" as an excuse for poor specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We kick off with the Samsung Galaxy Ace 2, which returns despite its age. It has a 3.8" WVGA screen of acceptable sharpness. The dual-core Cortex-A9 CPU with Mali-400 GPU is not quite Krait/Adreno category but is good enough. The 5MP camera with HD (720p) video recording matches the Lumia 520.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not up to par with the Lumia 520 in terms of processing and navigation options, but it's a good improvement over the Alcatel M'Pop from the previous section for just a bit more cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel One Touch 992D is a dual-SIM droid that is a noticeably cheaper alternative to the Sony Xperia M Dual, which we recommended last time (this time too, it's in the next price bracket). Both phones have 4" WVGA screens and 5MP/720p cameras, but the 992D is behind on processing power - it has dual Cortex-A9 cores and only 512MB of RAM. Also, it runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, which is getting old but is still supported by most apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Nokia Lumia 625 is an interesting offering - it has a 4.7" screen of WVGA resolution, which means low sharpness. The dual-Krait processor and 512MB of RAM are also less than you would expect of a phone this size. However, this is the cheapest phone with 1080p video capture and has the free navigation (for one country) and music goodies from Nokia and Office integration from Microsoft. A microSD card slot means cheap storage for videos and music too. Just like the 520, the 625 is great for people on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia isn't the only company that makes Windows Phone handsets, you know, so does Samsung. The Samsung Ativ S is basically a Galaxy S III running WP8. That means excellent (for the class) 4.8" 720p Super AMOLED screen, 8MP/1080p camera, removable 2,300mAh battery and a slim 8.7mm body. This gives it a decent edge over the Moto G and other Androids in this price range for that matter. Also, the Lumia 625 is thoroughly outclassed at virtually the same price in everything but the Nokia goodies (free SatNav, Nokia Music, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Moto G, which has stirred tons of excitement among Android lovers. Note that we skipped the 8GB version and went straight for the 16GB version - the price difference is worth it. This is the cheapest droid with a quality 4.5" 720p screen and one that has a quad-core processor to boot. Sure, these are Cortex-A7 cores, but our tests show it performs admirably. Plus, it's fairly compact (though a bit thick) and it will be getting fairly quick updates (not quite Nexus or Google Play Edition, but still). The camera is not spectacular, but 5MP/720p is a fairly good combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We consider this the new baseline Android phone - anything more expensive better have at least one key feature to top it off (e.g. a better camera or more storage) and anything not up to par with the Moto G better be cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned compactness as a desirable quality and it is, not everyone wants a 5" slab. This gave birth to the minis, but they are fairly expensive. The Huawei Ascend P1 is a nice alternative if the minis from Samsung and HTC are over your budget. It has a 4.3" qHD Super AMOLED screen and 8MP/1080p camera, just like the Galaxy S4 mini, though it's a bit behind on processing power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Moto G alternative for those who need dual-SIM is the Acer Liquid E2 duo. It has a 4.5" qHD screen (not as sharp as the Moto G's screen) and a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor. It's not exactly blazing fast, but it runs very decently and has an 8MP camera that records 1080p video (better than the Moto G's camera). Plus there's a microSD card slot, a relatively big 2,000mAh battery, DTS sound enhancement and rear stereo speakers to sweeten the pot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>?200-?300<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto G may've caused quite a stir, but the ?200-?300 price bracket still remains the sweet spot for smartphones. The Moto G is not without its flaws and these phones correct them, without breaking the bank. Considering your phone will be with you for a couple years at least, the extra ?100 spread out over the period isn't much if it will save you headaches or bring you more enjoyment. That means not having to delete files to make room, having a better camera or bigger screen, whatever fits your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M dual is quite compact with its 4" screen and, as the name suggests, we're talking about the dual-SIM version of the Xperia M (the single-SIM version was overlooked, because it brings nothing interesting to the table). A 4" FWVGA (480 x 854) screen is no HD screen but is decent enough and the 5MP/720p camera is a match for the Moto G camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throw in NFC, expandable storage and a removable battery and you have a serious competitor to the Motorola mass market phone. The M dual is within ?10 of the Liquid E2 dual and while it's down in some specs, Sony has beautiful design on its side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T has a 4.55" 720p screen, but what it has over the Moto G is a 13MP camera with 1080p video recording, expandable 16GB of storage, which could justify the small price premium. The screen viewing angles aren't great and the software updates will not be as quick (but Sony has a decent history of updating its phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C banks on people wanting a cheap phone with a large screen and dual-SIM connectivity. The screen has only qHD resolution, so it's nothing to rave about but the priority here is size rather than pixel density. The phone also has a quad-core Cortex-A7 based processor, 8MP/1080p camera, expandable storage and a beefy 2,390mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L9 II packs a 4.7" 720p screen and a dual-core Krait processor, with expandable storage, NFC and an IR blaster to sweeten the pot. The phone also measures 9mm thick, in case the 11.6mm of the Moto G are too much for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP is very similar to the Optimus L9 II but with better graphics and LTE. Better yet, it's close to the Moto X, which unlike its Moto G sibling can be very hard to find outside the US. The 4.6" 720p screen is nice despite its low contrast and the dual-core Krait processor is paired with a powerful Adreno 320 GPU. There are no always-on voice functions, but Sony is already planning the Android 4.4 update and there's a microSD card slot. Oh, and this is the cheapest phone with LTE we're recommending too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 is one of our favorite phones from the up-and-coming maker and one of the few relatively high-end dual-SIM smartphones. It's delightfully thin at 7.3mm and has a good 4.7" 720p screen. The quad-core Cortex-A7 processor proved powerful enough and the 8MP camera with 1080p video capture is nothing to sneeze at. The storage is fixed at 16GB, which is the one major complaint we have about this phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 is thinner still - it has a stunningly thin 6.2mm body and pleasant metallic back. Design is strong with this one, even if it takes the iPhone obsession a bit too far perhaps. It has a 4.7" 720p screen, Huawei's quad Cortex-A9 chipset and an 8MP camera with 1080p video capture. Despite the slender build, the P6 has a decent 2,000mAh Li-Po battery and even expandable storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 can be a good introduction to Android for former iPhone users who want a bigger screen - it's thin, light, attractive, and made of good materials, plus the custom Emotion UI is highly customizable and iOS-like at its base. Better still, it's not a huge financial risk to try (it's well below even the iPhone 5C).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia V is another alternative to the mini and the cheapest water-resistant phone that's worth your money. It obviously has that over the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini, plus a 13MP still camera, and a 4.3" 720p screen to match the HTC One mini. The expandable storage and LTE are nice touches too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 920 continues to drop in price and it's still a great deal. It's essentially a Lumia 1020 at half price, with the exception that you lose the massive 41MP sensor and some quality in the 1080p videos. It still has optical image stabilization though, the cheapest phone that does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the camera, the specs of the Lumia 920 and 1020 are virtually identical and you'll get the same software. Yes, you do get an LCD rather than AMOLED, but it's among the better LCDs we've seen. The 920 may be bulky, but at least it doesn't have the camera hump on the back. Plus, the price difference between the two is big enough to buy a real camera - the Lumia 1020 is more than twice the price of the 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned minis several times before, time to meet the first one. The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is one of the more compact smartphone offerings, as it's barely bigger than an iPhone 5s but manages to squeeze a 4.3" screen in. It has qHD resolution so it's not Retina-sharp, but it's a Super AMOLED, which has its share of fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon chipset with two Krait cores running at 1.7GHz with 1.5GB of RAM and Adreno 305 provides plenty of processing power for the class and the phone runs a fairly recent Android 4.2 version. The 8MP camera with 1080p video capture stacks up very well against similar cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini comes in LTE and dual-SIM versions too, but those involve a price premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of Galaxy S phones, the Samsung Galaxy S III is still a good deal if you compare it to something like the Sony Xperia SP. It's fairly compact for its 4.8" Super AMOLED screen with 720p resolution and has a very good 8MP / 1080p camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Exynos chipset with four Cortex-A9 CPU cores and Mali-400 is closer to the quad Cortex-A7 performance than a high-end Snapdragon, but is still good enough. It got updated to Android 4.3 recently too. The 2,100mAh battery is not huge by today's standards, but you'll get a decent run out of it. The 16GB of expandable storage gives you plenty of room for multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?200-?300 bracket also brings the first phablet in this guide. We told you this is the sweet spot. The Huawei Ascend Mate has a big 6.1" screen of 720p resolution, a Huawei-made chipset (quad-core Cortex-A9) and runs Android 4.1, upgradeable to 4.2. The Mate has a huge battery - 4,050mAh - which performed great in our battery test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet also packs an 8MP camera with 1080p video capture and 8GB of expandable memory. Phablets are a growing segment that straddles the space between phones and 7" tablets and offer plenty of screen real estate for browsing, document editing and gaming along with impressive battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G is the former LG flagship and the basis for the Nexus 4. It resolves two of the more common complaints people had with the Nexus 4 by adding 32GB of built-in storage and LTE connectivity and you also get a better 13MP / 1080p camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do, however, lose the pure Android version with timely updates. The Optimus G did recently get a 4.2 update and an official 4.4 build is on the way, which combined with its most recent drop in price make it a very compelling option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This category used to hold the Nexus 4, but that's not such a great deal in places with no Play Store - the Moto G is quite close in terms of specs at a noticeably lower price, plus if you want a great Nexus experience you should save up for a Nexus 5. Though as you'll see in the next chapter, we're not recommending that one either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?300-?400<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This segment is where flagship territory starts - maybe not the latest flagships, but there are a couple from this year. Still, most people won't need to look further up the pricing ladder, unless they are specifically looking for the cutting edge or a specific feature that phones in this bracket do not offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3, as the name suggests, is a phablet with a 6.3" screen. It is in essence an upscaled Galaxy S4 mini. The screen does have 720p resolution, which keeps the pixel density at a decent 233ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the relatively speedy Snapdragon 400 chipset (dual-core Krait 300 @ 1.7GHz, 1.5GB RAM, Adreno 305) and LTE. The 8MP camera shoots 1080p video, there's 8GB of expandable storage and a good 3,200mAh battery. It's pricier than the Ascend Mate, but the LTE and IR blaster enable some additional uses (fast browsing on the go, controlling a multimedia setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phablets like the Mega 6.3 are ideal for people who don't find 7" tablets comfortable to hold. True, the Mega is pricier than a Nexus 7 (2013) but it's a full featured phone. Also, it's on the verge of dropping into the ?200-?300 category, which sweetens the deal further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z came out at the beginning of this year so it's getting a bit old, but it's still an excellent phone - it has a beautiful glass-and-aluminum design and one of the few water-resistant device. The Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset is old for a late 2013 flagship (but that is most noticeable in benchmarks) and the 13MP / 1080p camera isn't up to par. The screen has poor viewing angles, but is decent otherwise. Also, the water-proofing didn't prevent Sony from putting in a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 improves on the camera, chipset, display and even battery and water-proofing rating, but is in a different price bracket. If it's outside your budget, the Xperia Z will do nicely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case the Ascend Mate and Galaxy Mega 6.3 phablets weren't good enough, have a look at the LG Optimus G Pro. It comes close to current phablets with a 5.5" 1080p screen, Snapdragon 600 chipset, 13MP camera and 3,140mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We booted the Nexus 4 off our recommendation because the Nexus 5 is out. We're looking at the 32GB version, which costs about as much as a 16GB Galaxy S4 and we believe the price premium over the 16GB version is worth it. The thing is, the Nexus 5 has a 5" 1080p screen and a more powerful chipset than the S4 and it runs pure, unsullied Android, which is highly desirable in some circles. The 8MP/1080p camera has optical image stabilization too, one of the few Android cameras that do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life isn't stellar, but with built-in wireless charging support you'll be able to top it off easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 needs no introduction - Samsung has spent tons of money on ads and over 40 million people have already bought one. The plastic-based design isn't anyone's favorite, but it fits a 5" display in the footprint of last year's 4.7" flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a Snapdragon 600 chipset, which until recently was the best in Android-land (and is clocked higher than other S600s), an excellent 13MP / 1080p camera and tons of proprietary features (detecting a hovering finger, split-screen multitasking).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One important tip - the Galaxy S4 also comes in an Exynos 5 version. Samsung has tuned both to have similar performance overall, but since the Exynos one lacks LTE you might find it cheaper in some places, which make it worth it for countries without LTE coverage. On the other hand, the Snapdragon 600 version is also compatible with official pure Android releases - you don't need the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition for that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?400-?500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now we're officially in flagship territory, even though this isn't the top tier category. Still, you need to have a good reason to go above ?500 as these devices will fulfill almost anyone's needs with cutting-edge features from this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One is one of the most beautiful Android phones at the moment (if not the most, depending on who you ask). It has a great 4.7" 1080p screen and a 4MP UltraPixel camera with optical image stabilization. Throw in the fast Snapdragon 600 chipset, stereo speakers on the front and a pure Android option like the Galaxy S4 and you have a strong contender.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will certainly draw people who dislike the plastic build of most of Samsung's phones along with audio buffs (the One has great audio hardware).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z Ultra phablet is a stunner - a huge 6.4" 1080p screen and a 6.5mm thin glass and metal body with an IP58 water-resistance rating to boot. It has a powerful Snapdragon 800 chipset and as of recently a Google Play Edition (you don't have to buy one, the ROM should soon be available for all Z Ultra owners with some tech skills to flash).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This the Xperia Z Ultra is probably too big to carry around unless you have a bag of some kind, but it's one of the most powerful phablets around and the only one that wouldn't mind a trip to the pool. We didn't recommend it last time but it's the device that has had the biggest price drop since the previous installment of our shopping guide, a whopping ?100 in a month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, the Xperia Z family experienced the biggest price drops in the two months separating our guides. The Sony Xperia Z1 dropped a fair amount too and is no longer in the ?500+ category. The Z1 is a revamped Xperia Z. The most impressive upgrade is the relatively big 1/2.3" sensor with 20.7MP resolution. That's point-and-shoot camera territory (including the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom) but it fits in a slender 8.5mm body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body is once again a triumph of glass-and-aluminum design and sports the latest Snapdragon 800 chipset with an even higher water-proofing rating than the Xperia Z. Then there's the big 3,000mAh battery and expandable storage - difficult to pull off on a thin, water-resistant phone but Sony did it. It's a bit large for a 5" phone though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera produces impressive shots - check out our 6-way camera shootout - and has some interesting proprietary camera features (how about streaming video to Facebook live?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the third iteration of the highly successful phablet series with an S Pen stylus. Now that it went in the sub-?500 category, it's the phablet to get. It has a beautiful 5.7" 1080p Super AMOLED screen and is powered by a Snapdragon 800 chipset, both of which make the split screen multitasking a real treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen also enables other multitasking options - it makes note taking and searching that much easier, and packs even more proprietary features than the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera did okay for stills and is absolutely amazing for video - it can record stunning 2160p video and excellent 1080p @ 60fps clips (better than the LG G2). For video, it has digital zoom that rivals the Lumia 1020s optical zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 breaks away from Samsung's traditional plastic design - it's still plastic, but the faux-leather back is very convincing and really classes up the place. By the way, the device's size hasn't changed since the Note 2, despite the increase in screen diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is targeted at business people (who will appreciate KNOX enterprise security) and power users who will love the huge mountain of features. If we had to go over them all, we'd have to copy and paste the review here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just make sure you're getting the N9005 version with Snapdragon 800 CPU - the N9000 with Exynos 5 lacks LTE and 2160p video capture.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?500 and above<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Call this the "money's no object" category, where only the best of the best will do. This category consists solely of flagships that were launched in the second half of 2013 - you'd be surprised how much of a difference even half a year can make in the tech world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phones here didn't make the cut by virtue of their value for money ratio, but rather phones that are exemplary in some category. This is the category that saw the least movement - other than a few phones dropping in the lower price bracket, it's the same old faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 is the true successor of the Nokia 808 PureView and has the most amazing camera ever found on a mobile phone. A huge 1/1.5" sensor with a whopping 41MP resolution creates amazing shots and with supersampling to 5MP, sharing is easy. Nokia is creating a ton of proprietary camera features like lossless digital zoom, manual controls and the Refocus app. Oh, and the 1020 is the only phone with a powerful xenon flash. The audio recording for videos is top notch too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do have to deal with the protruding camera hump on a phone that's not slender to begin with, and Windows Phone 8 could be a plus or a minus, depending on your preferences. It has a decent 4.5" WXGA AMOLED screen and dual-core Krait chipset, but Androids are wholly unimpressed. The 2,000mAh sealed battery is also not great, but you can get the grip accessory for an extra 1,020mAh and a more comfortable hold on the phone (albeit with added bulk).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This phone is all about the camera as it takes pictures like no other phone. Point-and-shoot cameras have a tough time competing, too. But if not for the camera, we can't justify double the price over the Lumia 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 could have made the cut earlier, but we left it for this category because of LG's Apple-like pricing strategy - the 16GB version is too limited by storage, but the 32GB costs ?100 more. We wouldn't recommend 16GB storage as those HD videos (especially 1080p @ 60fps) and advanced 3D games will devour it in no time. And if not for the video or games, the beautiful screen, powerful chipset and 13MP OIS camera will go to waste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the LG G2 does have an amazing 5.2" screen with 1080p resolution that fits in the footprint of the Galaxy S4 and HTC One. It also packs a Snapdragon 800, which trumps the S4 (at least until the S4 LTE comes out), a 13MP camera with optical image stabilization and a lasting 3,000mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design might not be to everyone's tastes, and the volume rocker on the back is especially unusual (the tap to wake option has its detractors too). It's also plastic, which isn't up to par with the HTC One or Xperia Z1. Make no mistake though, the LG G2 is one of the best Android smartphones available at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've finally reached the Apple iPhone 5s price point. Don't get us wrong, it's an amazing smartphone but the pricing gets harder to swallow each passing year, especially when you can have good Androids and WP8 phones at half the cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a gorgeous device no doubt, with a thin and light aluminum body and people really seem to enjoy the new gold color option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera shows improvements over the 5s, but we can't shake the feeling that that it falls behind the curve. The new Apple A7 chipset is a modest beast (don't be fooled by core count and clock speed, it's a new architecture) and iOS 7 brought some much needed improvements. The TouchID fingerprint sensor is not a novel feature, but it's the best implementation on a smartphone yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, as is usually the case with iPhone's, we come back to the problem of storage - 16GB just isn't enough these days (unless you don't store multimedia, don't play a lot of games and don't shoot a lot of video). Consider that: the 16GB 5s costs ?100 more than three Moto Gs with the same storage. And Apple asks another ?100 for the 32GB version, which makes things even more ridiculous from a pricing standpoint - that money buys you a Galaxy Note 3 (32GB plus microSD card slot) and either a Galaxy S III (16GB plus microSD card slot) or Nexus 7 32GB (2013).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft shed the screen resolution and chipset limits with WP8 GRD3 and Nokia took advantage with the Lumia 1520. It's a 6" phablet with a 1080p, a Snapdragon 800 chipset and a 3,400mAh battery - basically, as good as any Android flagship. Anyway, the camera received almost as much attention as the Lumia 1020 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a smaller sensor (1/2.5") with half the resolution, but it still has quality ZEISS optics and optical image stabilization. No xenon flash, but the lossless digital zoom is on board (due to the lower sensor resolution, it's not as long as that on the 1020) and so are the quality microphones for best-in-class audio capture for the 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not an exaggeration to say that the Lumia 1520 is the best device Nokia has made. But it's big and heavy - not the biggest phablet around, but perhaps too big for a general device. At least it's not solely dependent on its camera for success like the Lumia 1020.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we wrap this up, we thought we should present a bundle - the Asus Padfone Infinity 2 with the 10.1" tablet dock. The price is pretty high, but if you add up the price for a flagship smartphone with a 5" 1080p screen and Snapdragon 800 chipset and a 10.1" WXGA tablet, also with Snapdragon 800, you'll find out that the bundle actually saves money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's very pricey though so it's only a worthy purchase for specific usage scenarios - if you're okay with a 7" or even an 8.3" Snapdragon 600 tablet, there are cheaper options out there. Also, keep in mind that only one device can be used at any time - you can't be on the phone while someone uses the tablet as the Padfone Infinity 2 is the heart of the tablet. If you're the only one that will use the two devices, however, it makes little sense to pay for a Snapdragon 800 chipset twice.</paragraph>
