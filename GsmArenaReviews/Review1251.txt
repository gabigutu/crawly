			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alright. This one's a bit different. So we act accordingly. And because we're not quite versed in all things fashion, let's move straight to what we're good at. Meet the HTC Rhyme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Key Features</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Main disadvantages</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seriously, now. Tough job building a ladies phone - but hey, that's what accessories are for. Before we get to them though, the HTC Rhyme is a delicious little phone, except that it's not that little at all. The good thing is the trademark unibody design is less industrial but softer and more delicate. And the colors? Apart from the accessories, the paintjobs are the only thing that makes the handset different. Feminine?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme is hard to define. It almost feels like they didn't plan this one as a phone for girls. When they later decided to target the female audience, they came up with all sorts of relevant accessories. You'll never hear anyone at HTC call it the ladies smartphone. But it's being marketed as one. They are extra careful to avoid references to Android and don't even call it a smartphone in any of their ads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not what we're gonna do. We'll look at the smartphone inside the Rhyme. And see if it could be his smartphone too, as much as hers. That's what HTC would gladly have people think. It'd be a win-win for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's see what's in the HTC Rhyme for users. We have the full list of features and possible deal-breakers coming up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, what's so special about the Rhyme? No, it?s not another Beats Audio phone - although we love the headset it ships with. We're looking at a pretty much standard unibody package running a familiar Android Gingerbread/Sense UI combo. But the accessories and paintjobs do make it different from the slew of Android handsets. There is a leather pouch, a docking cradle, specially designed headphones and the eye-catching Charm cube that lights up upon an incoming call or message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a feature-rich smartphone and the box is full of surprises, and useful too. Wanna have a closer look? Read on for our traditional unboxing and hardware checkup.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme comes in a big box filled with goodies. The only standard accessories are the power plug and microUSB cable. The rest is all custom-made for the HTC Rhyme. To begin with, there's a uniquely designed in-ear headset with music controls. The cable is a flat tape kind rather than normal wire - and yes, it is tangle-free. We loved the sound of it too, rich with plenty of bass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme has 4GB of internal storage, but less the one gig of it is actually user-accessible. To make up for that, HTC have put a class 4 microSD card in the box with another 4GB worth of storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you'll find a white leather pouch, the so-called Charm and a docking station (133 g).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cradle will charge the phone and serve as a music center or a nightstand clock. When the phone is placed in the docking station, it automatically launches the Dock Mode app. It has a clock, a weather widget, virtual music controls and a shortcut to the gallery slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock also has integrated Bluetooth speakers, turning it into a small but impressively loud stereo system. It's upholstered like a piece of furniture and the color of the cloth matches that of the handset. The bottom has an anti-slip rubbery finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Charm cube plugs in the 3.5mm jack and comes with a 50cm-long cable. It's basically an external status LED for women to hang off their purse. Upon an incoming message or call, the Charm cube flashes intermittently. It's got an extra strong cloth-covered cord and the jack has a little bracket that fixes it firmly so the phone can actually be pulled out of the purse by the cable. The Charm isn't compatible with other HTC phones - we tried it on the HTC Explorer and it thought it detected a headset. The LED didn't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other accessories too that are sold separately. HTC offer a Bluetooth headset and an in-car Bluetooth speaker. They too come in matching colors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Rhyme 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme measures 116.8 x 61 x 10.1 mm and weighs 130.7 g. It's basically a Desire S - or an HTC Radar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design has been recycled but the HTC Rhyme is undoubtedly a good-looking phone. And different enough. We obviously don't have the purple version, which isn't exactly gender-neutral. Our review unit came in the Clearwater variety - essentially, some pastel hues of blue. We have to say it - the colors are nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, it's the much appreciated unibody design with the anodized metal front frame extending around the back. The downside is the battery is non-user-replaceable. But this may as well be irrelevant for the targeted demographic. Two bits of soft-touch rubbery plastic complete the design of the rear panel. One accommodates the camera lens and LED flash, the other is the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rhyme comes with a 3.7? S-LCD screen. And while you won?t get to enjoy any AMOLED blacks, it's a decent viewing experience. Our biggest gripe is the rather low contrast. HTC might have been aware of that too and did well to get rid of black elements in the interface graphics. Even the main menu background is grey. Overall, the pastel tones of the preloaded skins don't give away the screen's weakness. In the browser though, we wished the text was crisper and colors punchier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rhyme's display has passable viewing angles and the sunlight legibility is up to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results of our now traditional display brightness and contrast test. As you can see, the Rhyme fares decently against its peers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, a video-call camera is right next to the earpiece above the display. There are also a couple of hidden sensors there ? proximity and ambient light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen, we find the four capacitive keys. The usual Android controls are haptic enabled, well spaced and very responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The long and thin volume rocker is on the right side, while the covered microUSB port is on the left. Some people find port lids a bit of a hassle but keeping the good looks intact is a priority for the HTC Rhyme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the 3.5mm audio jack, which also serves the unique Charm cube. There's a secondary microphone used for active noise cancellation and the Power/Lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the phone is the microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel consists of three parts ? an anodized metal piece in the middle and two bits of plastic that feels soft and rubbery to the touch. The camera lens, LED flash and the speaker are at the top, along with the docking cradle pins. The lower half of the rear slides open to grant access to the memory card slot and SIM compartment. The bits of plastic have different colors but the whole thing doesn't look poorly patched together - a problem we had with the original HTC Sensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Rhyme has some Wi-Fi death grip issues similar to those on the Sensation and the Sensation XL. Just place the phone flat on the palm of your hand and the phone loses a few notches of Wi-Fi signal. In fact, touching the area around the camera and loudspeaker can reduce the Wi-Fi signal to zero.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover is a bit hard to slide the cover open, but eventually you'll get the hang of it. The battery is non-replaceable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD slot is hot-swappable and the phone comes with a 8GB card pre-installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1600 mAh battery of the HTC Rhyme achieved a score of the respectable rate of 39 hours in our battery test. This means that if you use your device for an hour each of phone calls, web browsing, and video playback every day, you will have to recharge it every 39 hours. You can check out the full scoop on the Rhyme's performance over at our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The HTC Rhyme battery scorecard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rhyme has the trademark HTC build and although it recycles a familiar unibody design, it has character even without the unique accessories. There's little to complain about, ergonomically. We'd note the missing shutter key. The screen is the right size, pleasingly responsive and adequate outdoors. It's let down by contrast though. The phone is different from the countless droids out there and good-looking too. It won't look ridiculous in men's hands - not our color version anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail package is impressive but that's where things get complicated. We won?t even mention the Charm cube but the upholstered docking cradle is not very masculine either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense/Gingerbread combo still rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme comes with Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread and a spruced-up version of the HTC Sense, v3.5. We already saw the new Sense on the Sensation XL, but it turns out the Rhyme's skin has had some custom touches to it. There's a redesigned homescreen and some new widgets. There are a few new apps too. Of course, everyone who has dealt with an HTC Android smartphone will find their way around the Rhyme trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's start from the beginning. Here's a video demo of the latest Sense UI running on the Rhyme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC lockscreen has to be the most functional, most customizable lockscreen we've seen yet. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, you can drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme comes with six different lockscreen styles preinstalled, which can be accessed in the Personalize menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default homescreen just shows the ring, four shortcuts and the time. There's a Photo album lockscreen, which tosses photos from your gallery in cool 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other lockscreens include the Friend Stream with social updates from your contacts and the Weather screen, which shows off the Sense UI's cool weather animations. There's Stocks too, with quotes flying up or down in eye-pleasing 3D. Finally, there's the Clock lockscreen which shows a bigger clock - you can pick any of the 17 clock widgets you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there're no extra lockscreen styles to download off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going further than the lockscreen reveals the new Sense homescreen. The old scroll arc at the bottom is now gone and replaced by two shortcuts at the bottom corners - the app drawer and dialer. It's simpler and good-looking. There are seven homescreen panes as usual and scrolling between them is looped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Leap view is a trademark Sense UI feature. Tap the home key (while on the main homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Sense v3.5 you can add and delete panes, not just reorder them. There're 7 homescreen panes tops, which is enough to fit plenty of widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense comes with the proprietary HTC Scenes ? essentially three custom homescreen setups (Default, Entertainment, Social). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets, but those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes and you can get more scenes off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper each and use different colors for various UI elements. They can also replace the lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can choose between two different sorting options - alphabetically or most recent - but you can't rearrange them manually. Alternatively, there's a list view, where two-finger alphabet scrolling is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? All apps, Frequent and Favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of items to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget, you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are 17 different clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Twitter widget, for instance, shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet/update status. The other version displays @mentions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag it across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the bottom of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second "button" is Remove, which obviously deletes the widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two new HTC widgets on the Rhyme - Shortcuts &amp; Clock and Family. The first one is now the default widget on the center (default) homescreen. It replaces the old Clock and Weather widget, but keeps an integrated digital clock and weather information. The focus though is on the five buttons on the left. You get Mail, Messages, Music, Camera and Market shortcuts. And they're not simple buttons by the way, more like drawers you can open and close. Tapping on the music widget for example will take you to the music player app. But tapping on the small handle on the right, will open the box to display the last played track with basic music controls. You can resume play from there, without going to the player app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Family widget is quite similar to Friend Stream, but after a quick configuration, it will track only your family's social and location updates. There is a dedicated app too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. The usual press and hold of the Home button will launch the actual task switcher. The notification area is tabbed too - the second tab has toggles for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings and the last line shows used/free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard task switcher, you get a task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another useful app that HTC preloaded is the usage monitor - it tracks you data, call and message usage. There are apps in the Market that do the same, but this one is styled to match the rest of the interface. We wish it had a widget to let you monitor usage at-a-glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast boot feature is enabled on the HTC Rhyme as well. The apps preserve their state after the restart ? so if you were browsing a web site before turning the phone off, the browser will restore your session.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A single-core CPU and Adreno 205 GPU are proven to be enough to power the Gingerbread/Sense UI combo. The 768MB of RAM is enough too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Rhyme wouldn't escape our usual set of benchmarks anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is BenchmarkPi - a CPU-intensive single-core benchmark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack is a multithreading-enabled benchmark - the Rhyme was tested in single-thread mode, while others (dual-core) were tested in multi-threading mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 205 graphics however posted dismal performance in NenaMark 2 - while most games aren't as heavy as the benchmark, newer high-end games will be unplayable on the HTC Rhyme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two in-browser benchmarks results also hit the BrowserMark chart's bottom, while it did pretty good on the SunSpider benchmark. Just so you know though, the actual browser experience is still excellent, so you should have no worries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-organized phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Rhyme's phonebook is rich in features and quite good at the social networking stuff. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed and with more tabs than the stock Android. Version 3.5 of Sense merges the Phone and People apps into one. So, you have the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of contacts has two lines per entry, the contact's name and their latest SNS update (with an icon to identify the social network used).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. The interface is tabbed here but it has been reorganized and the new view makes more sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is called Thread - it lists regular messages, email and call history with that contact. It's the next tab, Updates, that handles the social networking side of things - it lists both events from online calendars and SNS status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fourth final tab holds the online galleries of the contact, including Facebook and Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re switching from another phone don?t worry ? you don?t even need a computer to pull your contacts, messages and calendar items from the old phone into your new Rhyme. The Transfer app supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an old trick (Symbian-powered Nokias have been doing this for ever) and most people would probably go with syncing the contacts over the cloud, but still it?s a handy tool to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had no issues with reception and in-call audio with the HTC Rhyme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the numpad). The HTC Rhyme has both Smart Dialing and Voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rhyme also knows some accelerometer-based tricks ? turning the phone over will mute the ringer while placing it down starts the loudspeaker automatically when you are in the middle of a call. The other feature is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Rhyme fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored a Good mark, so missed calls are highly unlikely, especially when the Charm is connected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hassle-free messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Rhyme are capable of handling all sorts of text messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages. The Charm cube will do just that as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can set the preview to be one, two or three lines). Tapping on a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered ? the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. ?drx? matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable delivery reports and you can backup text messages to the internal storage memory (and restore them from there later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the Rhyme boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard with big enough, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is big and covers over half of the screen in landscape mode. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user-friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Mail app and Gmail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme comes with two email clients ? the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app has been updated too. Emails are organized into three tabs and can be sorted by date, sender, subject, priority or size (both ascending and descending). You can browse all folders for the email account or view all inboxes combined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go for the latter option, emails are color-coded so it's easy to tell which email belongs to which account. You can mass delete emails or mark them as read too (you can't perform other operations en masse like you can in Gmail though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the tabs. The first one, Received, contains all the emails. Then comes the Thread tab - it groups related emails into conversations (hit the down arrow to see the list), but once you open an email you can only view them one at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are previous/next buttons in the menu, but it would have been more convenient to view all messages together on the screen (like in the Gmail app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, you have a Favorites tab that holds only email from contacts in the Favorites group and an Invite tab that collect invitations from online calendars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Rhyme lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery you'll like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Gallery stacks photos like the vanilla Android gallery does (it used to display a list of thumbnails). The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution. You can also select which folders the gallery should display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ones you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo on the HTC Rhyme is very straightforward ? tap the share button, pick your preferred sharing method and select one or multiple photos/videos to share. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo-sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube or use DLNA to push photos to your compatible TV too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options ? you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Rhyme supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 50% with a simple double tap on the screen or continue to pinch zoom until you reach 100%. The implementation here is extra smooth too. And if you pan past the edge of an image, you'll scroll into the next image, which is a handy way to browse multiple photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good enough codec support for the video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the All videos subfolder in the Gallery. There's no dedicated video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files are displayed as a grid and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr, even apps like Dropbox (comes pre-installed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC Rhyme offers a full screen toggle (stretches the video to the screen's aspect) and you can scrub through videos. There's no subtitle support though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player was hit or miss when it came to playing videos. Non-HD resolutions would play trouble-free for all formats supported but MKV. Even some HD videos managed to play but only just - we managed to get a 720p WMV and MP4 videos play smoothly, while the rest of the formats failed. Of course, the MP4 videos produced by the Rhyme?s own camera (H.264/AVC Baseline) played trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes handy too ? the Rhyme can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player is a looker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player has been updated a bit - the initial screen has two big buttons - a drop down for My Library/DLNA media servers switching and Categories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard view for My Library is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other four categories (Albums, Songs, Playlists and Genres) through the Categories drop-down menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs but that worked rather strangely. You can skip between different albums/artists but not individual songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rhyme offers the SRS sound enhancement plus a standard set of equalizer presets when you connect a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the bottom corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. Other goodies include looking up a song on YouTube or updating the album art for the current or all songs. You can enable auto update too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share a song or use DLNA to play the song through a DLNA-enabled audio system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a neat feature - a 3D card stays on the lockscreen that lets you control the music player (previous, next and play/pause). The card also shows the album art and name of the song and artist. You can flip the card - it's backside shows album art and track info too, but lacks music controls (you can use that to prevent accidental taps that change the song).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is nothing to frown at<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme did fairly well in our traditional audio output test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Rhyme produces really loud and nicely clear output. The scores it achieved are pretty great, save for the only average stereo crosstalk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, volume drops to average levels when you plug in a pair of headphones and while the stereo crosstalk only suffers mildly, the intermodulation distortion rises quite a bit. Overall, the Rhyme isn't the audiophile's dream device, but it should easily do for the average user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see how the Rhyme did for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme packs a 5MP camera that does stills of up to 2592x1944 pixels and records 720p video @ 21fps. There?s a single-LED flash / video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very space efficient since the Sense 3.5 update. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. The still/video toggle and front/back camera toggles have been combined in a single menu and the Effects button has been moved to the top left corner - this freed up space for the Scenes and Settings button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a gallery shortcut (a thumbnail of the last photo taken) in the bottom left corner and a virtual zoom lever along the bottom. By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off (note that cropping reduces the resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Scenes are pretty cool - especially since they grew an extra feature we saw for the first time on the Sensation XL - Backlight HDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme has face detection and touch focus. Continuous autofocus is enabled too which is good to have on a phone like the Rhyme with no hardware shutter key. On the downside, the continuous autofocus may be way off in some shots - the only way to be certain you have the right focus is to tap and hold the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geo-tagging is an option too as is Auto upload - all you have to do is pick a service (Facebook or Flickr), an album and when to upload (Immediately, daily and Wi-Fi only), the phone will take care of the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other image effects too. For example, Warp places a control point on the screen, which you can drag with your finger and see the result in real time. Depth of field is another such effect ? it adds a radius slider besides the control point and will blur everything in the photo that falls outside the circle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Rhyme produces decent photos with enough resolved detail (although it could have been much better), lively colors and good contrast. The noise levels are also kept low, there is no over sharpening or purple fringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures you take with the Rhyme will do for Facebook and other web albums, but it is not the device to capture your best moments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've got a bunch of samples below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 5MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Rhyme shows no trace of pink spot, something quite rare of an HTC droid. It also does pretty well in synthetic resolution and the rest of the charts, but in real life it's not among the 5 megapixel smartphones we would recommend.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Poor 720p video, does slow motion in WVGA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but only before you start shooting ? then the focus is locked and won?t change unless you tap an area on the screen, which will cause the camera to refocus on that area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One interesting feature here is the 2x slow-motion mode - it only works for resolutions up to WVGA. This mode also disables the audio recording. Unfortunately our unit had some issues with the slow motion videos, so we can't post a sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have effects for videos too - Grayscale, Sepia, Negative, Solarize, Posterize and Aqua.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you're done recording, you have an option to trim the beginning and the end of a video in case you started too early or you let the recording run for too long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot in .MP4 format in 720p resolution at 21 frames per second (24 fps at best), so most of the videos are a bit choppy. The video quality is average at best for a 720p shooter and the compression is too high. We really won't recommend relying on the Rhyme's camcorder for your videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched sample 720p@21fps clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a video uploaded to YouTube for convenience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the HTC Rhyme in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 720p mobile camcorders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can spot the differences between the Rhyme and other competitive droids - it lacks in everything - captured details, contrast, colors, noise reduction.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme has a complete connectivity set. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and blazing fast tri-band 3G: 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink thanks to HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Connected media app handles all sorts of DLNA connections ? it plays media to and from devices on the network with just a couple of clicks. Apps like the Gallery and music player have such functionality built in too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computers Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive now have big, thumbable icons, which is great since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support 1 to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable ?allowed users? only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hassle-free web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme has the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread web browser with Sense UI 3.5 polish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser goes into full-screen when the web page finishes loading and has very minimalistic UI, which leaves almost the entire screen to the page's content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an URL bar at the top of the screen flanked by a back and refresh keys. Once you zoom in and pan around the page, even that bar disappears. Still, there are plenty of options - you have to press the menu key to reveal them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are home and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out even more options ? stuff like find on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rhyme's browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes even longer texts extremely easy to read on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then the low pixel density makes it illegible) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. You can tag bookmarks which is a great way to organize them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme has full Flash support and YouTube videos up to 480p played smoothly. HD videos however prove too much for the CPU and the videos get extremely choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use the YouTube app if you find navigating YouTube in the browser hard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried out a few Flash games and they worked fine as well. You can play the Flash content in full screen and landscape mode, which makes the most out of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.3 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag which is the way of the future, now that Adobe has given up on mobile Flash.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent organizer and office package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps are aboard the HTC Rhyme, with a mobile Office app to boot that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word and Excel documents but not 2007 docs or any presentations. Oddly, you can edit existing PowerPoint presentations and Office 2007 docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files. The on-screen keyboard does cut down the available space in half but if you zoom out you can still fit a reasonable amount of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This version of Polaris gives less editing options than we're used to - you can do copy, cut and paste, then apply bold, italic and underline styles and highlight text and that's it. There used to be font style options here but now they're inexplicably gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you can edit formulas in Excel spreadsheets, you have to type them in manually (there's no wizard or even a list of functions here) and selecting cells happens one by one - you can't just tap and drag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can download them into the internal memory too if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Desk clock app turns your Rhyme into a? well, Desk clock. The option to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night is gone, replaced by a shortcut for the Dock Mode (we already covered it into the hardware section or our review).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app lets you quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. You can use the Stocks lockscreen too. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an HTC-branded flashlight app too ? it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick lookup is a handy app that lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatted for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Facebook and Twitter apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which let you post on the world?s largest social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Facebook app is available, which enables things like Facebook Chat (there's a separate app for that too) and Facebook Places (which lets you to check into the likes of Foursquare).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app for Android also comes preinstalled ? some might prefer it over Peep (they both integrate with the phonebook so you don?t have to actually start the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app is the latest version too ? tweets can be geo-tagged, you can snap a photo to include in the tweet straight in the app (uploaded automatically to yfrog or TwitPic) and there are handy buttons to reply to or retweet a message.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>When the Android Market is not enough, HTC Hub and HTC Likes comes handy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Market uses several side-scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. This organization reminds a lot of the Apple's App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make finding apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to look for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Market items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTCSense.com integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your Rhyme contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the Sensation XE in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy but if you?re using an updated browser you should be fine. However, HTCSense.com failed to load properly in Internet Explorer 9 but it worked once we enabled Compatibility Mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and HTC Locations to navigate you<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in about two minutes (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Rhyme also comes with HTC Locations, an app developed in cooperation with TomTom (provider of the software) and Route66 (providing the maps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HTC Locations you can download country maps for free, or just cache maps as you browse (the size of the cache is adjustable). Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can calculate new routes even when offline ? and Gmaps can?t (it can only reroute you, not calculate a new route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t do voice-guided navigation for free like Ovi Maps though ? but still, you can use the list of instructions and tap the next and pervious arrows to see the next turn. Not ideal but it?s a great addition, especially since it?s free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can always pay for a voice-guided navigation license too - it's cheaper than buying a dedicated GPS unit. You get a 30-day trial to see if it's worth it or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better look of what?s ahead. It?s just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode ? at first it seems choppy, but that?s only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world). You could use two fingers to rotate the camera manually too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been a long time since we last saw a phone exclusively targeted at women. Was the Nokia 6600 fold or the Samsung Diva the last ones?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, if you remember those, you are old enough to remember old jokes how women can't park and men hate advice. We're not so sure about that though. Men don't ask advice but they certainly read gadget reviews. As for the gals, we're sure they can handle gadgets well, even the big bad droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, the HTC Rhyme is not an Android - it's more like a Fembot. On a serious note, HTC don't like to call it a smartphone, let alone mention Android anywhere in the conversation. However women are clearly the HTC Rhyme's demographic whether HTC admits it or not. Rich in features and generously accessorized, on top of being quite attractive, it will easily connect with its target audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't look like a particularly hard one to make either. Decisively similar to the Desire S, the only actual difference being the updated Sense UI, the Rhyme is still keen on offering robust user experience and good performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the paintjobs and the set of accessories that help it stand out. Comes pricey for a single-core phone but all the extra stuff in the box certainly counts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the HTC Rhyme comes with hefty price tag. If you happen to be looking a smartphone without using the word ?smartphone? itself, there is probably no need to continue reading the next lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are still undecided, now we are going to explore the few options for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-core HTC Sensation is the first smartphone to cost nearly the same as the Rhyme. It offers a bigger screen, a lot better hardware specs, a bigger camera sensor and less impressive retail package. Its fingerprints issues may turn out to be a problem for some, much like the notorious Wi-Fi signal death grip. But if you want a beast for your money, this is probably the right gadget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Sensation</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can?t miss the Samsung Galaxy S II too. It has everything that Sensation offers in specs, but comes with the less eye-candy TouchWiz UI. It?s got a better camera than the is better though and there are no problems with fingerprints or death grips. And there?s the Super AMOLED Plus screen too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are lots of cheaper single-core droids out there as well ? the Sony Ericsson?s Xperia arc, the LG Optimus Black, HTC Desire S or the Galaxy S Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson?s Xperia arc ? LG Optimus Black ? HTC Desire S ? Samsung Galaxy S Plus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wondered at the beginning if men could be interested. Not likely, given all promos portray it as a ladies? gadget. Not even if they swapped the Charm with a car charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we were to give buying advice, the ladies would love the accessories and the phone's looks. The features offered are quite good too. As for guys, well? you may be surprised. Some stereotypes are made to be broken, as @SassiBob would readily point out.</paragraph>
