			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It looks like the point where it all ends. A galaxy outgrowing its own limits. An explosion of energy and speed. An overdose of smartphone power. A phone that makes you love the smell of Android in the morning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The likes of Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II make it easy to get carried away. But wait a minute. There?s nothing quite like the Galaxy II. The brightest stars on the smartphone scene have graced our homepage, but this one is trying to eclipse them all. The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is in no mood to share ? the spoils or the spotlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a spec sheet like that, it?s a beast of a droid. Even in today?s viciously competitive market, the Galaxy S II has so many firsts to be proud of. Samsung?s very own Exynos chipset, the unmatched Super AMOLED Plus screen and the ultra-slim body only begin to tell the story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With manufacturers busy making facelifts and sequels to get our hard-earned cash, we are often wondering if an upgrade is worth it. Well this time, it takes but a glance at the specs to tell that the answer is yes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You?ve got a problem with the PenTile matrix of the original Galaxy S ? the Galaxy S II is here to fix that. Or was it the laggy RFS file system bothering you? Well, be our gest and enjoy it the EXT4 way. The GPS issues or the lack of flash for the camera too much for you to handle ? they?ve got it all fixed here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But fixes are just the beginning and they come to show that Samsung has listened to the customers. The key selling points of the Galaxy S II will most certainly be the impressive 1080p video recording, better still photos and, probably most important of all, the new Exynos chipset that powers the whole thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get an extra core, higher clock speed and the new Mali-400 GPU that?s supposed to blow everything we know out of the water. Not to mention the sweet gig of RAM to make sure that multitasking is a walk in the park for the Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 28.07.11: We've added an overview of Samsung Dive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As long as everything works as promised, there?s no doubt users will be delighted with this one. But let?s find out ? the Samsung Galaxy S II is back after the break for a proper hardware inspection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing: a few more accessories would have made a good box perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has managed to fit the I9100 Galaxy S II in a pretty compact box. To an extent that you?ll be unprepared for the actual size of the phone inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bundle includes a charger, a one-piece headset, a microUSB cable and a quick start guide. That?s all the basics covered, considering that the device offers ample storage out of the box. However, Samsung will still ship its flagship with an 8GB card in some markets taking the initial storage to either 24GB or 40GB. Not bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news is that the MHL adapter required for HD TV-out and the USB adapter enabling the USB host functionality aren?t included. It?s a real pity ? both work pretty well but many users will probably not bother purchasing them and won?t get a chance to try them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 125.3 x 66.1 x 8.5 mm, the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is a phone to be taken seriously. A massive screen in a body so slim, the new Galaxy beats the predecessor on every count: bigger, slimmer, sharper. And the handling is even better, despite gaining 0.3? in display diagonal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a hint of a chin at the back, and a hardware menu key flanked by a couple of touch-sensitive buttons the Galaxy S II does bear resemblance to its predecessor. However the slimmer bezel around an even more impressive screen does take looks a level up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight is also kept impressively low ? at the mere 116g, the Galaxy S II is 3 grams lighter than the original Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back has also been improved with the glossy blue-dotted plastic replaced by the finely textured surface we?ve come to know from the Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace. This particular finish is practically immune to fingerprints and quite pleasant ? and secure ? to hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some metal on the body might?ve suited the flagship but, since it would?ve upped the weight, we are willing to live with the second best option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, no matter what finish the design team would have come up with, all eyes would always be focused on the 4.3? Super AMOLED Plus screen anyway. It retains the WVGA resolution of its predecessor, but uses a conventional matrix with three-subpixels per pixel instead of the PenTile matrix of the first-gen Super AMOLED displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PenTile screens were often criticized for lacking in sharpness, due to the lower number of total subpixels, but the truth is that the change is hard to notice. Of course, if you look close enough you?d be able to tell the two apart, but in everyday usage the difference is subtle at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the added screen estate does make a big difference: an already impressive display has become superb. Just place the two Galaxy phones side by side and you will clearly see what you are gaining with the new one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now enjoy the deepest blacks on the market on a surface over 15% larger. Contrary to Samsung claims though, the brightness doesn?t seem to have improved ? an observation that our display test confirmed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t matter all that much though ? the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II screen remains perfectly visible in all lighting conditions. Bright sun or not ? you will always be able to read the display without losing too much color either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AMOLED screens are known for wide viewing angles with no loss of contrast or color distortion well into near extremes. There isn?t much to say about screen sensitivity either ? Samsung sure knows how to make a good capacitive unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pleased to report that the green tint that was a common complaint on the original Galaxy S is gone in its successor. Now colors still aren?t perfectly accurate, but are more than good enough for most practical purposes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another criticism against the first Super AMOLED screens was color saturation. There didn?t seem to be a general consensus on that matter ? some loved it while others thought it was too much. Well, Samsung obviously paid attention and did the best that could be done in the situation ? they gave users a choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II has a new screen setting called Background Effect. It lets you adjust saturation with three available modes: dynamic, standard and movie in descending order of color intensity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final key asset of the Super AMOLED Plus display is its power efficiency. Being able to turn individual pixels off, those screens don?t need all the backlighting all the time and thus consume less energy, especially when darker themes are used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, Super AMOLED Plus screens and mobile phones are really meant for each other. It?s a perfect match that reveals all the strengths (unrivaled image quality, perfect viewing angles, energy efficiency and great sunlight legibility), without suffering the traditional OLED weaknesses (higher production costs for larger units and shorter life).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really can?t see any other screen on the market that could come close to the brilliance of the Galaxy S II unit, save for Samsung?s own Infuse 4G, which packs an even larger (4.5?) Super AMOLED Plus screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ll have to take our eyes off that beauty though so we can check out the rest of the Galaxy S II hardware. Below the display you get the same three keys as on the international version of the first Galaxy S ? capacitive Menu and Back buttons and a regular press Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual extra functionality upon a long press is enabled ? the Menu key handles Google search on the device, while the Home key brings up the task switcher. This time. And if you click the home key twice the voice control gets activated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we have the earpiece, as well as ambient light and proximity sensors. The front-facing camera for video-calls and video-chat has had its resolution bumped up to 2 megapixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II features the volume rocker and the lanyard eyelet. The volume keys double as zoom lever in camera mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, all there is on the right is the power key. A dedicated camera key would?ve been much appreciated. We find virtual shutter keys to be less than ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One minor but particularly annoying design flaw of the original Galaxy S has been addressed. The power/lock button no longer falls on a sloped edge and is a lot easier to press without risking the phone slipping off your grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy S II hosts the unprotected 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port at the bottom is used for both data connections and charging. Not only does it support USB host but it also comes with MHL enabling HD TV-out connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MHL is a way of using both microUSB and HDMI through the same port. It makes sense, especially provided an HDMI port could?ve been near impossible to put in a phone this slim. The downside is you need an adapter to use a regular HDMI cable with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing to note at the bottom is the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is where the 8 megapixel FullHD-capable camera lens is located. Right next to it is the LED flash, which will probably see more use a flashlight and video-light than a still-camera assist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill is at the back too ? right on the slightly elevated chin at the base of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the paper thin battery cover reveals the SIM compartment, the 1650 mAh battery and the microSD card slot. The card slot can take microSD cards of up to 32GB, which can give you a maximum total storage of 64GB if you go for the 32GB version of the Galaxy S II. The bad news is the memory card isn?t hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much to our surprise the SIM card was hot-swappable. Sure, the Galaxy S II will politely ask you to restart when you take out the active SIM, but if you ignore that, insert another card and then restart the radio by turning airplane mode on and back off you will still have fully functional telephony with the new card. Different carriers are no problem either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1650 mAh battery is quoted at 18 hours and 20 minutes of talk time and up to 710 hours of stand-by in 2G networks. In 3G, it?s 8 hours 40 minutes of calls and 610 hours of standby. Of course numbers so high can only be achieved in a lab environment. They have little to tell us except that Samsung has probably tweaked the power consumption of the cellular radio. Unfortunately that is by far not the most power-hungry part of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a real life scenario, it gave us over two days of moderate to heavy use (about an hour of browsing, some photos, several calls and half an hour of using the other phone features daily).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also done a dedicated video playback test for the Galaxy S II - the smartphone survived through 8 hours and 5 minutes of continuous SD video playback before its battery level reached 10% at which point the video player shut down. You can find more about our test  in our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second battery test was about the Galaxy S II endurance while browsing the web. The dual-core smartphone lasted for 4 hours and 22 minutes, while loading a page every 10 seconds, which is 16 minutes longer than its predecessor managed. What's more when we switched to a third-party browser (Opera Mobile) that doesn't use GPU acceleration the battery life increased to 4 hours and 59 minutes. You can see how the Galaxy compares to the other handsets we tested here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall handling of the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is pretty good for a device this size. The grippy back is nice and the slim body certainly helps single-handed use. Anyone happy with the original Galaxy S handling will be delighted with this one. Of course, a screen this size has its implications on the actual handling. We do think though, they did the best they could in terms of ergonomics with a phone this big and this slim.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: TouchWiz launcher got an update too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hardware changes all seemed good, but if recent years have taught us anything is that it?s the user experience which counts. Well, Samsung must?ve known that too and they put a due amount of R&amp;D effort into improving the TouchWiz launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes brought by TouchWiz 4.0 start at the very lock screen, which you can now remove by swiping in any direction, rather than just sideways. The cool feature where missed events (messages, calls etc) get their own unlock patterns is still here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The heart of every Android smartphone, the homescreen, got plenty of tweaks too. You get that rectangular design for the widgets, which freshens up the looks, and several new widgets to improve the functionality. The process of adding widgets has been visually enhanced too with fresh transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power widget, which controls the radios on your handset has been improved and now lets you control the screen time out straight on the homescreen in addition to providing one-click access to the settings menu. It?s those two additions that make this widget worth using. On the previous Galaxy smartphones its functionality was almost entirely doubled by the notification area shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This seems the right place to mention a couple of new live wallpapers that come preinstalled on the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II. They are actually developed in cooperation with Accuweather and display the current weather conditions on the whole screen. Think Sense UI weather widget, but on a larger scale. The two different wallpapers in fact only differ by the background ? one has a few wind power propellers, while the other uses a beach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen panes is business as usual ? you pinch zoom-out to display an aggregate view of all panes, which you can then easily rearrange, delete or add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panes serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There was some work done on the app launcher too. For one, you can now create folders inside it (though given that folders are enabled on the homescreen we don?t see much use for that here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, creating folders is pretty easy stuff ? in edit mode you drag the icons you want over to a blank folder icon at the bottom of the screen. Then you drag the folder to the screen on which you want it to be placed and pick a name for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create new menu pages in much the same way ? browsing through your existing ones and picking the icons that you want to have placed on the new page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Needless to say the app launcher panes can be rearranged exactly like you would the homescreen ? pinch zoom and some swiping around does the trick quickly and intuitively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly redesigned in TouchWiz 4, but there aren?t any major changes to functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the task manager, which Samsung kindly preinstalled, has seen some functional updates. The RAM screen has been modified and there is only one clear memory button now, instead of the two in the previous version. Now, with 1GB or RAM and with the new Gingerbread policy of keeping resource-hungry background processes in check, we are not sure you will need to enter the task manager all that often, but it doesn?t hurt having it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, accessing the task manager is as easy as it gets ? you can either place the widget on your homescreen or use the shortcut that appears below the task switcher when you press and hold the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final noteworthy change brought by TouchWiz 4 is the introduction of gesture controls. Of course turn-to-mute is nothing new how about tilting your phone to zoom in and out in the gallery or the web browser. Or turning it sideways to move widgets around the homescreen or icons around the app drawer. It's much like the gesture controls of the LG Optimus 2X and Black but the gestures are activated somewhat differently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Exynos chipset doing its magic inside, the overall user experience is pretty smooth on the Galaxy S II. For more on this, join us on the next page, where we?ll take a closer look at the dual-core Cortex-A9 CPU and the Mali-400MP GPU and their performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Exynos 4210 performance: Buckle up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Exynos 4210 chipset is where the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II gets its speed. With a couple of Cortex-A9 cores, clocked at the unseen before 1.2 GHz, a brand new Mali-400MP GPU and a healthy gig of RAM, this phone is nothing short of a serial speeder. That?s why we decided to run a few more benchmarks than usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first objective was to measure the improvement the new dual-core architecture CPU brings over the 1GHz single-core Cortex-A8 CPU ticking inside the original Galaxy S. Given that both devices are now running Gingerbread we can count on the fact that all benchmark differences are almost entirely down to the chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is all there for everyone to see. In terms of pure computing power the Galaxy S II is not just better than its predecessor ? it sweeps the floor with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We then wanted to see how the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S compares to the other dual-core CPU-packing chipset on the smartphone market, Tegra 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A couple of things to bear in mind here ? the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S maximum frame-rate is capped at 60fps so benchmarks that aren?t challenging enough would normally fail to go beyond that. That?s why the Galaxy S II will score lower than its theoretical possibilities in some benchmarks, like Quadrant for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lets? not forget either that the I9100 Galaxy S II runs Gingerbread, while the Tegra 2 representative, the Optimus 2X is still stuck on Froyo, which accounts for some of the difference (though Gingerbread really doesn?t bring all that much in terms of performance improvements).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see it's mostly one way traffic here. The only exception is the gaming score at SmartBenchmark 2011, where the Galaxy S II not only lost to the Optimus 2X, but also to its predecessor.Yet, given how easily the Samsung new flagship wins elsewhere we suspect this is due to some imperfection of the benchmark app itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So with Tegra 2 already a pretty powerful chipset, the Exynos 4210 is nothing short of a beast. We found it capable of playing 1080p (yep, that?s FullHD) Flash videos straight into the browser. More about that later, let?s now proceed with the software specifics, safe in the knowledge that the Galaxy S II can give you all the power you may possibly need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-in-one phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have moved a few things around but the phonebook is pretty much the same as it was in the original Galaxy S. It has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One odd thing we noticed is that the Samsung Galaxy S II cannot display SIM contacts ? there?s simply no setting for that. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can?t display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you?ve created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook keeps the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The Samsung-specific swiping gesture is here too ? swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right ? tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your social networks. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge contacts (you can do it manually too), so that the contact details are pulled from the social networks too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard ? one displays the person?s contact information the other keeps call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff ? status updates and the contact?s online galleries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is great, voice commands are easy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II had great in-call quality and the sound was crisp and loud. Reception was good and we didn?t suffer dropped calls though in areas of very poor coverage the sound would break up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each with a separate tab. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is also available ? a double tap on the Home key activates voice commands. All you need to say is ?Hi Galaxy? and speak your command (e.g. ?text Dexter?). Or ?play 

 ? and off it goes. It takes a second to launch voice commands but the coolness factor makes it well worth it.
</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s worth noting that this is a third-party app and not the standard Google service ? it?s better than what regular Android?s have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Curiously, we managed to hot-swap the SIM card ? it?s easily removable once you pop the back (unlike the microSD card, however strange that is) and all we had to do was switch Flight mode on and off. After that, the Galaxy S II was ready to make calls with the new SIM, on a different carrier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the I9100 Galaxy S II. It snatched a Good mark, meaning missed calls will be rare but it will happen from time to time in noisy environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really appreciate is that the tap to compose box is much bigger ? as big as can fit on the screen, no more viewing only 2-3 lines of text from your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you?re composing a new message you can use the Translate option to translate it into another language. The same goes for messages you?ve received. This feature probably won?t see much use but it?s there you ever need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between accounts is pretty easy. The top row holds two labels ? the first is the name of the inbox you?re currently viewing (tap it to change the inbox) and the one next to it is the name of the current folder (again, tap to change it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II sports a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone landscape activates the split view ? the left side of the screen shows the list of emails, while the right side shows a message. This is the same kind of interface we?ve seen on the Galaxy Tab though the bigger screen there made it actually useful ? half of even a 4.3? screen isn't enough for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text entry is handled by the standard Samsung QWERTY keyboard, which offers very big and comfortable keys. In landscape mode, the keyboard takes up most of the display and the even bigger keys make it one of the most comfortable virtual mobile keyboards around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you ? aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there?s nothing new really. And don?t you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but functional file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image and video editors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You also get an image editor and a video editor preinstalled. The image editor handles the basics like image rotation, cropping (no resize though) and adjusting brightness/saturation/contrast. You can also make selections (using a smart tool similar to the Quick selection tool in Photoshop). It?s not nearly as accurate as the Photoshop tool though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can apply effects too but the one feature that caught our eye was Context fill ? similar to Photoshop?s Context-aware fill tool but, again, not nearly as accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video editor lets you arrange multiple clips (or photos) and music on a timeline and create a new movie to share. There are several presets, which change the look and feel of the final cut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s pretty basic but you can trim videos, split them, change the transition between scenes, apply effects and a few other tricks to turn you into a pocket Spielberg.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II uses the standard TouchWiz music player. We guess it?s reserved for the Galaxy S lineup. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There?s 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitles sync (move them back or forward a few seconds) but there?s no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it ? starting with .WMV, through .AVI (DivX and XviD) and .MP4 to .MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn?t a problem either ? the Samsung Galaxy S II played FullHD files. Large files of over 2GB worked as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were also pretty impressed with the Samsung Galaxy S II battery life when playing videos. The handset endured 8 hours and 5 minutes  of continuous SD video playback before its battery level reached 10% at which point the video player shut down. This is good 40 minutes longer than its single-core predecessor, despite the increase in screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second battery test was about the Galaxy S II endurance while browsing the web. The dual-core smartphone lasted for 4 hours and 22 minutes, while loading a page every 10 seconds, which is 16 minutes longer than its predecessor managed. What's more when we switched to a third-party browser (Opera Mobile) that doesn't use GPU acceleration the battery life increased to 4 hours and 59 minutes. You can see how the Galaxy compares to the other handsets we tested here</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 8 stations as favorites. You can also listen on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II might have lost a mm around the waist, but it certainly hasn't lost its voice. The performance of the smartphone in our audio quality test is pretty good overall and it's really impressive in the active external amplifier part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So when the Galaxy S I9100 has no resistance applied to its line-out it got excellent scores all over. There are really no weak points to its performance here and since its pretty loud too we are left with no other option but to give it an excellent mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things aren't as impressive when you plug-in a pair of headphones. Stereo crosstalk, which increases rapidly, volume levels decrease and intermodulation distortion starts creeping in. The general result is still decent, but we've certainly seen better here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera: solid image quality, customizable UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II comes with an 8MP auto-focus camera for photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixel resolution. It comes with an LED flash but nothing in the way of lens protection or physical shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface looks pretty familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get several controls by default but the good news is that you can pick four shortcuts to put there ? commonly used features need to be one tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of features, the Samsung Galaxy S II offers pretty much everything ? touch focus, scene modes, face/blink/smile detection, effects, geotagging, digital image stabilization and manual controls for ISO, metering mode and so on. There are other features too, we?re just listing the most interesting ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images captured with the 8MP camera of the Galaxy S II are very good ? there's low noise, plenty of fine detail and the color and contrast are good too. Colors are a smidge oversaturated while the white balance is a bit too cool for our liking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II enters the skirmish over in our Photo Compare Tool. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In short, the camera produced a very clean image with very little in terms of processing artifacts (traces of sharpening), no moiré patterns and no pink spot either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent FullHD video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one. You get the same customizable panel on the left for four shortcuts. The video camera can record video using the front facing camera too (resolution is limited to VGA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FullHD videos are top-notch, full of detail, low in noise and generally, nice and smooth. There?s plenty of information (bitrate is over 17Mbps) and the only drawback you might consider is the mono audio recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One annoying thing we noticed about the video camera is that it starts to focus only after it has started recording ? that means the first second of every clip is out of focus. We really hope that would be fixed in a future software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A peculiarity is that when shooting FullHD videos you have a narrower field of view than that of the still camera. Perhaps Samsung are using the same trick as Apple in the iPhone 4: the camcorder uses only the center of the 8MP sensor instead of shooting with the whole surface and then scale it down to 1080p. In 720p video capture mode however they use the whole sensor and as a result, the field of view is close to that of the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the record, the still camera of the S II has 28mm focal length in 35mm equivalent while the numbers for the 1080p and 720p cameras are 46mm and 32mm respectively. As you see, you get quite a magnification in the 1080p mode. In 720p mode quite strangely, color rendering improves over 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To match the field of view of the still camera in the 720p mode, Samsung is using the whole surface area of the sensor and combine the information of adjacent pixels into one to get the resulting single megapixel resolution. This technology is called pixel binning and its advantage includes reduction of the digital noise with no loss of resolved detail. So 720p videos on the Galaxy S II might be the better choice for low-light shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two frames taken out of 720p and 1080p videos and put side by side. The two videos were shot from the exact same position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The longer focal range in 1080p mode also makes for a shakier video so you might want to look for a support for your hand while recording to get the best out of the Samsung Galaxy S FullHD camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder features continuous autofocus, which is pretty smooth though a bit slow at times. Here?s a demo of it in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than those peculiarities, the video quality is very good at 1080p ? the .MP4 files come with 17Mbps bitrate and have a lot of detail. The framerate is quite consistent in good light, but in the dark FullHD videos are shot in as low as 25fps. That's not an issue with 720p videos - those turn out nice and smooth even in low ambient light. That's yet another reason to prefer the 720p mode in low light shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that FullHD videos gobble up a lot of storage ? a minute of video will easily top 100MB of file size. We only wish part of all that massive bitrate went to stereo sound - the S II videos have mono sound at just under 60Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What this means for the occasional videographer is 720p videos might turn out the better option in low light as the process of pixel binning used for downsizing the information captured from the 8 megapixel sensor down to 720p actually benefits the suppression of digital noise too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We prepared a batch of video crops comparing the Galaxy S II to the LG Optimus 2X. The videos (both 1080p and 720p) were shot with the Galaxy S II and the LG Optimus 2X one after the other. Just keep in mind that the JPEG compression has added some extra artifacts but it?s an equal handicap, if at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will notice the undeniable edge of the Galaxy S II in colors in detail even without taking into account the smoother video framerate. At 720p, both camera are just about equal in resolved detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few videos Samsung Galaxy S II for you to enjoy. The last one was shot in 720p resolution, while the other two are in 1080p (don?t forget to select 1080p when playing them and certainly open it fullscreeen).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is the second phone in our Video Compare Tool database that can record 1080p. The Tool?s page includes a quick walkthrough on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at individual frames reveals that the video compression doesn?t result in many artifacts (compression-related or of any other origin). The actual resolution is notably higher than the only other 1080p-enabled competitor, the LG Optimus 2X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However in low-light conditions the Galaxy S II resolution advantage quickly diminishes and its resolved detail is about the same as that on the Optimus 2X.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity chock-full of new technologies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II starts off with the basics ? quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G (AWS is missing though). There?s HSPA+ with 21Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink too, which some carriers brand as ?4G? even though it?s not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there?s Bluetooth 3.0 with High Speed, which promises transfer speeds up to 21Mbps. Wi-Fi Direct is a similar technology, which offers simple pairing of two devices but blazing speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes a/b/g/n versions, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s optional NFC support too ? the first Galaxy S II phones that have it should launch this summer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer). We didn?t give it a proper run for its money, but we guess it works over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. There isn't one included in the retail box and those are quite hard to get by, which is pretty disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MHL port has yet another feature ? it enables USB On-The-Go. You?ll need an adapter for that too (there isn't one in the box) but this one is fairly straight forward ? you plug it into the Galaxy S II and plug a standard USB cable on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB thumb drives and card readers mostly worked (though some didn?t) and reading all sorts of cards was problem-free ? it even worked with a big CF card. Connecting phones mostly didn?t work ? only one connected properly and that was an old Nokia that doesn?t charge over the USB port. USB keyboards don?t work either. You can check out this post to find out more about the USB OTG support in the Galaxy S II, there?s a video demo too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A great web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser hardly has changed, the hardware specs of the Samsung Galaxy S II propel it to great heights of user experience. The large, sharp display with great colors makes reading a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum ? that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The powerful dual-core CPU (and probably some GPU acceleration) enables the Galaxy S II browser to play 1080p Flash video. That was truly impressive stuff ? a lot of netbooks would choke on something like that. You can play touch-optimized Flash games without a hitch too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android has grown Hubs too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hubs are not just for Windows Phone 7 ? Samsung, at least, seems to think so. They?ve added a total of 4 Hubs to their new Android super phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we?ve seen before ? it combines you email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn) and IM accounts (Gtalk, MSN and Yahoo! Messenger) and shows all incoming messages as one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There?s filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Hub lets you browse music online (with search tools, charts, lists of new releases and so on). You can preview songs (30 seconds each) and buy tracks or whole albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the Readers Hub. You can subscribe to Internet newspapers, magazines or buy e-books. You can download free book previews. Extensive genre listings will help you discover new books to read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s the Game Hub, which will quickly become your go to place for finding new games. The titles are separated into Social and Premium games and there?s a news section too. There?s a try-before-you-buy option, so you can check out a game before committing your cash. The nice thing about that Hub is it includes the titles by Gameloft, which are otherwise not available on the Android Market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Editing Office files is a breeze<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II comes with the Polaris Office preinstalled, which seems to be getting rather popular with hardware manufacturers lately. And for good reason, we guess ? it?s one of the most feature rich mobile editors we?ve seen. You can view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and there?s a PDF viewer to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing covers an almost full set of options ? text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables (that?s a first). If you?re editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, merge cells and so on. Even full-featured PowerPoint presentations are doable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do practically anything with the app ? it?s better than the other mobile editors we?ve tested, even better than the Windows Phone 7 one (which had many editing limitations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app doubles as a file manager and also integrates with Google Docs and Box.net.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a YouTube app although it?s really irrelevant here. It cannot match the resolution the in-browser flash player can give you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, by the way ? our unit came with Angry Birds but it was the regular free version for Android (with ads).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS with Google Maps Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in under two minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We gotta say, we didn?t experience any issues with the GPS performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (or larger) than most dedicated SatNav units, with excellent sunlight legibility and plenty of storage, any money spent towards satellite navigation should go to buying a good app rather than a separate SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course ? Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it?s available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn?t do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market ? there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market is the Galaxy S II playground<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU and powerful new graphics, the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II can run every Android app designed for phones. The OS version is 2.3.3 so you won?t have any problems on that account either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kies Air ? a web server on your phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects to the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you an URL to type into your computer?s web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone ? from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who?s connected to the phone at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing is you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: You?ll need a reasonably modern browser with Java and some video plug-in (QuickTime worked for us).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Dive locates your device, remote wipes it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Competition between phone makers is getting really heated, so they're offering more and more free services to lure in customers. Samsung Dive is a prime example - it's a phone finder/remote wipe service, something which used to be a premium, corporate-centric feature back in the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The officially supported devices currently include the Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy S II, along with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Tab 8.9 and the Samsung Wave. That's it, even the Galaxy S Plus isn?t listed. An exception we found is that the Samsung Wave II is supported too even though it's not on the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star of the show here is the Remote Controls feature (actually, it's the only feature). It can locate your phone or you can set it to track the phone for 12 hours on, recording its position every 15 minutes. If you?ve only misplaced your phone, say, it?s behind the couch or your dog?s been using it as a bite toy (true story!), there's an option to ring the phone out loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if it turns out that the phone isn't in the house you have the option to lock the phone, wipe its memory and check the call logs to see if there were any calls made from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Locking the phone lets you enter a message to display on the device (up to 100 characters) and you can enter a phone number, which will be the only number callable from the locked phone (you'll also get an SMS to that number if the SIM card is changed). A 4-digit PIN is also required, which can later be used to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that if you choose to wipe the device, you'll no longer be able to use Samsung Dive on it. You can re-register if you find it, but tracking will no longer work, which means remote wiping is your last resort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When trying to locate your device, you have two options - Find my phone and Track my phone. They may sound alike, but they do differ a bit. Track my phone records the phone's location in 15-minute intervals over a period of over 12 hours and plots the locations on the map (Google Maps is used).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, for it to work, the phone needs to have a GPS lock - the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning won't cut it. So, if the phone is in a building or in another area with poor GPS signal, tracking won't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find my phone works fine with the less accurate options but it only shows the phone?s current location and it won't record past positions. The nice thing is that even if all location options were set to off before the handset was misplaced, those will be enabled automatically as soon as you start looking for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike HTCSense.com, Samsung Dive is purely for locating your device or remote wiping it. There are no options to view/manage contacts or messages or anything like that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Absurdly powerful and having a one-of-a-kind screen ? the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is an easy phone to recommend. But that?s one thing you don?t need to do. Its reputation precedes it. The Galaxy II succeeds where previous dual-core droids have failed and provides the most complete smartphone experience to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung were a few months late to enter the dual-core race, beaten by both LG and Motorola, but the time was obviously used well. The Galaxy S II doesn?t look like it was rushed to release halfway through the i-dotting. It?s a monster of a phone and one that feels comfortable with all that horsepower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little wonder really that Samsung are currently selling the Galaxy S II faster than they can manufacture it, never mind the slightly inflated price tag. Not only does it have everything ? it sets the bar for the things to want in a phone. We just cannot see beyond the new Samsung flagship if we?re to name the ultimate smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if rumors are to be trusted, and the iPhone 5 misses the expected June release, there only seems to be one challenger on the horizon ? the HTC Sensation. We can?t be sure of course exactly how the HTC will fare against the Galaxy S II. Samsung are already using their head start though ? they are selling their flagship as hot cakes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Sensation</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the LG Optimus 2X has the advantage of a lower price tag, while the optional lapdock gives the Motorola Atrix an added dimension. In terms of raw power though ? and number of premium features ? the Galaxy S II is the obvious choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Optimus 2X ? Motorola ATRIX</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, Samsung will gladly have you believe that the AT&amp;T-bound Infuse 4G is the next best thing. But we just can?t see how more than a year-old hardware is to match the Exynos. So even if the bigger Super AMOLED Plus screen gives the Infuse 4G a bit of an advantage, it?s the Galaxy S II that has the future proofing. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I997 Infuse 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That by the way goes for the Sony Ericsson Arc as well. You may be saving a few bucks today but you will certainly be better off with the Galaxy S II in the long run. Especially given Samsung?s update record (the original Galaxy S is enjoying Gingerbread now and has seen two major OS updates since its launch).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?re phones to look for, phones to talk about, phones to be seen with. The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is all that and more. Android is the smart platform of choice these days. With phones like the new Galaxy, Samsung is set on becoming the brand to beat.</paragraph>
