			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo brought so many new devices at CES - phones, a wrist band, tablets and laptops, and we are still digging through the press releases just to be sure we didn't miss anything. Of course, we will be focusing on the phones and their accessories, but if you want to learn more about those new cool Yogas and ThinkPads, among others, just head over to our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro and Lenovo P90 are the two new smartphones introduced at CES. The Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro keeps the cool tri-layered design, but gets a 64-bit octa-core CPU and a better high-res selfie camera with cool external flash (sold separately).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo P90 focuses on the camera department with a 13MP sensor with optical image stabilization and dual-tone LED flash. The snappy Intel Atom Z3560 chipset should offer great performance, especially with the blazing-fast PowerVR G6430 GPU. The 4,000mAh battery should be quite a thing, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Lenovo Vibe Band VB10 fitness accessory for your wrist, should be an excellent companion for your Android or iOS smartphone. It uses an e-Ink display, it's water-proof and its battery will last you about 7 days with the screen always turned on. How about that!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've spent some quality time with those three gadgets and we are ready to share with you our first impressions. Shall we?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro looks a lot like the original Vibe X2 smartphone - it is built around a lightweight unibody of magnesium alloy and a tri-color frame. We really liked the Vibe X2 and you bet we are very keen on handling the Vibe Z2 Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pro model has received a few prominent upgrades - a 0.3" bigger display, a newer generation chipset with a 64-bit octa-core processor, a front 13MP selfie snapper and a slightly bigger battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro is indeed quite the looker and its specs are a dream come true for many. The 5.3" IPS display of 1080p resolution looks great in real life, with accurate and lively colors, decent contrast and viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of relying on the MediaTek True8Core chip, this time around Lenovo has bet on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 615 chip. It offers an octa-core processor with 4x Cortex-A53at 1.5GHz and 4x Cortex-A53 at 1.0GHz. The new graphic accelerator is Adreno 406, while the RAM amount stays at 2GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely many users will be attracted by the front-facing 13MP auto-focus camera, which should allow for amazing selfies. While it might not be accompanied by a flash as on the Desire Eye, Lenovo is offering an external 8-LED (diffused) ring flash called VIBE Xtension Selfie Flash that plugs into the 3.5mm audio jack on top of the Vibe X2 Pro. This way you will be able to capture the perfect shots even in the darkest rooms though you'll have to buy this rather gaudy accessory separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro also comes with a 13MP rear sharpshooter, this time around coupled with a LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone comes with 32GB storage, expandable via a microSD card slot. It also supports dual nano-SIM cards and LTE connectivity. There is just one ejectable bed on the right side of the Vibe X2 Pro - you can either put two nano SIM cards or choose to use one nano-SIM and a microSD card. Huawei has been doing the same things for its latest phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro run son Android 4.4 KitKat skinned with Lenovo's Vibe 2.0 UI. The customizations run deep, themes are supported, among other rich customization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe X2 Pro will launching in April in Champagne Gold, Rock Pink and Electric Blue. The pricing is yet to be detailed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo P90 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo P90 is the second smartphone to be announced at the dedicated Lenovo event at CES in Las Vegas. It comes with an even bigger 5.5" IPS display of 1080p resolution and packs an ample 4,000 mAh battery under the hood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from these great phablet specs, the Lenovo P90 is focusing on the stellar performance and imaging skills. Lenovo chose to use the latest Atom Z3560 chip, which embeds a quad-core 1.83GHz processor, blazing-fast PowerVR G6430 graphics and 2GB of RAM. The hardware should indeed deliver snappy performance on the 1080p screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear 13MP sensor has been backed by optical image stabilization and a dual-tone LED flash for better white balance on the flash shots. We weren't able to test the P90's imaging skills, but you bet will be doing it in details once we get our hands on a retail unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera is also selfie-friendly at 5MP, though not as impressive as the one on the Vibe X2 Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of the Lenovo P90 is quite ordinary, nothing fancy, though the profile is nicely slim at 8.5 mm. It feels solid and handling is pleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing we didn't quite like in the Lenovo P90 is the lack of microSD expansion slot. Here is hoping the 32 gigs will be enough for all of those great shots and multimedia you will upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo P90 is hitting the shelves in February, but the pricing is yet to be confirmed. The available colors are Pearl White, Lava Red, and Onyx Black.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The band is IP67-certified wateproofing, as it can last up to 1M of water for maximum of 30 minutes. It supports both Android and iOS and packs a slew of fitness tracking functionality. The Vibe Band can track steps, calories, distance and sleep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartband also supports notifications such as calls, SMS, Facebook, Twitter and WeChat messages up to 200 characters.
