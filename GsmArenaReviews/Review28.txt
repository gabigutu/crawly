			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG are not quite making Android headlines. Catching up with local rivals Samsung is obviously not the first thing on their mind. Not to mention that HTC are desperately out of reach. Alright, Android is not LG?s pet project but they?re not completely droid-phobic either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company?s first Android smartphone is a good example of that. Released without much notice, it doesn?t put anything new on the table. The LG GW620 wasn?t meant to anyway. It stays focused on social networking and gives the company?s loyal users a taste of Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those who tried and liked the Cookie (in all shapes and flavors) are treated to a more substantial meal. On the LG GW620, Android is in a way served in dumb phone guise ? to make loyal users feel at home and give the device some background and identity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good looks and friendly feel, the GW620 has the right feature pack to get you started on Android. It?s a midrange device for the young, and some of its shortcomings should be easy to forgive. Or shall we say ? less noticeable from where the Cookie stands. The touchscreen should?ve been capacitive perhaps. And the Android version 1.5 must?ve made a lot more sense at launch (a couple of months back) than it does now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, the LG GW620 is still a solid midrange offer ? especially for upgraders coming from a feature phone. Reasonably priced and quite likely to be carrier-supported, the GW620 will treat users to a very practical side-sliding QWERTY keyboard, fast data support, Wi-Fi and stereo Bluetooth. There?s also an inbuilt GPS receiver, a digital compass and a 5-megapixel autofocus camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GW620 keeps such a low profile that some might be unaware of the evolutionary gap between it and an LG GW520. This could?ve been a conscious choice though to motivate a smooth and painless transition. The platinum sales of the LG KP500 Cookie inspired a number of sequels ? the GW520 is definitely part of the whole thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG must?ve reasonably assumed quite a lot of their feature phone users would be willing to consider upgrading. And the GW620 is a solid option: a smart QWERTY messenger that will please the young, who are ready to give Android a try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, you just checked out the spec sheet but there is still much of the GW620 waiting to be discovered. Join us after this very small jump as we explore the looks and feel of this neat communicator droid.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 retail package will please most of the phone?s intended users. Along with the phone you get a microUSB cable and a universal USB charger, which can be used for charging any other compatible device over USB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the box also accommodates the usual paper work (a short but sufficient start-up manual). The phone features a standard 3.5mm audio jack and so do the supplied earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a closer look, we found the complimentary 1GB microSD card in the phone?s memory card slot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG GW620 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For a full QWERTY side-slider, the LG GW620 manages to keep size as friendly as possible. It measures 109 x 54.5 x 15.9 mm which makes it almost as compact as the GW520. The weight, on the other hand, reaches 139 g which might sound a bit too much for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same goes for the thickness, at 15.9 millimeters. As we found out though, the size and weight are perfectly fine for the form factor. The handset feels pretty solid and handles comfortably: we enjoyed using it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most of the other devices in the GW lineup, the GW620 was made with the younger customers in mind. It is colorful ? though definitely in a more subdued way than the KS360. The all-plastic handset is surprisingly solid and quite compact considering the spacious and comfortable 5-row QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing fancy about the rubbery finish at the back but it adds to the solid feel and friendly charm of the phone. It's also quite practical and fingerprint-resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front, on the other hand, is finished in glossy black, which looks way more stylish but gets covered in fingerprints the moment you grab the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GW620 front is taken by the 3" display which we?ll discuss in a second. Underneath we find three controls: two capacitive keys (back and home) and a centrally placed Menu button. The latter is the typical Android contextual menu key ? not a Main Menu launcher in feature phone terms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-sensitive buttons are haptic-enabled, brisk vibration marking every tap. The center Menu key is a bit too small, with rather low stroke, but still decently usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen there is the centrally placed earpiece, ambient light and proximity sensors on its right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 has a very friendly five-row slide-out QWERTY keyboard with well spaced keys and excellent touch orientation. The soft and even backlighting guarantees comfortable use in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you slide out the hardware QWERTY keyboard, the screen changes its orientation to landscape automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only control on the left-hand side of the GW620 is the volume rocker. Right next to it is the microUSB port covered by a protective lid. The microUSB port is used for both data connections and charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opposite side hosts the dedicated music and camera keys, as well as the microSD card slot. Just like the microUSB port, the card slot has a plastic cover to keep off dust, and keep the line of the handset intact. We used a 16GB card with the phone and had no issues with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard 3.5mm audio jack and the Power/Lock button are placed at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is bare. It only features the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker as well as the camera lens and the LED flash are easily visible on the back of the device. The GW620 features a 5 megapixel autofocus snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover is a breeze ? you simply slide down to release. Underneath is the 1500 mAh Li-Po battery. The LG GW620 is quoted at up to 8 h of talk time and 600 h of standby time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should point out the very good build: it's an all plastic piece of gear but solid and quite durable. The handset handles nicely, the slider action is smooth and solid, and surfaces (except the front) are fingerprint-proof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 is not thin at all, but remains compact, and offers a secure hand hold. Thanks to added weight (when compared to the GW520) it feels very robust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Operating it is exceptionally comfortable in both single hand (quick tapping on the touchscreen) and two-hand scenarios. Typing on the QWERTY keyboard is quite fast as well and the handset has commendable balance with the slider up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A resistive touchscreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 has a 3? touchscreen of HVGA resolution (320 x 480 pixels). There is nothing wrong here ? it?s the typical first-gen Android specs. The GW620 is among the few Android handsets to feature a resistive screen. It?s comparable to the HTC Tattoo actually ? another entry-level droid, which took cost-cutting even further with its 2.8? QVGA screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the GW620 display is quite responsive (for a resistive touchscreen) and manages to deliver great image quality indoors. However, traditionally for LG, the sunlight legibility is quite poor. There are much cheaper phones on the market that deal way better with the sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the resistive technology used for the GW620 screen, there is no support for handwriting recognition. However, the fantastic hardware QWERTY keyboard will make you forget about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found a strange bug affecting the GW620 display: every time we started the camera, the screen brightness was automatically lowered. To fix it we had to get back to the settings and set the brightness at the maximum again. Go figure! After we researched it, it turned out it?s a quite frequent bug among GW620 owners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 20 May 2010: A recent firmware update seems to have finally solved this problem so it doesn?t occur anymore. However, the update doesn?t bring a newer version of the Android OS so a Cupcake (v1.5) still is the best you can get from the GW620.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG-style Android interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 runs Android 1.5, which is getting a old, but at least has been retouched by LG. It?s not a complete makeover as we?ve seen on HTC phones with the Sense UI but it brings Android closer to what LG users are used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you get three homescreens to put widgets on, but at the bottom there are four buttons in typical LG feature phone style ? dialer, contacts, messaging and menu. Another tweak to the homescreen panes is that they are looped ? there?s no end point from which you need to sweep back. Good for navigation usually, but with just three homescreens it?s not a big deal anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area, one of the strong points of the Android UI, got a tweak as well ? it has two switches for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. You could probably snatch a widget from the Market that offers even more switches, but the advantage of putting them in the notification area is that they are accessible throughout the whole interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 doesn?t have the standard set of hardware Android buttons, instead LG have decided to use only three ? home, back and the menu key. The Search key is missing, but pressing the menu key on the homescreen offers a Search button, along with the usual options to add a widget, change the wallpaper, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reskinning effort by LG went a little deeper ? the main menu has been changed too. It now groups apps into categories (Communication, Multimedia, Utilities and so on) and the icons of most apps have been replaced with LG style icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a small gripe with this ? not all icons were changed, like the Android Market and Gmail ones. Perhaps Google doesn?t let manufacturers change them, but still ? the difference in styles is very visible and a little annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the menu you?ll find a little tool called Homescreen selector, which lets you pick between the vanilla Android homescreen and the custom LG Home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG didn?t preload the LG GW620 with additional widgets aside from the standard Android v1.5 ones. Of course you can get some off the Android Market, so we?ll let this one slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI on the LG GW620 is acceptably fast, but it lags occasionally, which makes it seem unresponsive at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the LG GW620 compares to the HTC Hero in terms of performance. We used the free Benhcmark and PiBenchmark apps from the Android Market for the test and the results are here for you to see.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is social<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android v1.5 has one single Contacts application that includes four functions ? the Dialer, the Call log, Contacts and Groups. The app uses a tabbed interface for easy navigation between the four functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the Contacts list, there?s a Search contacts button to compensate for the lack of a physical search button) and an Add a new contact button. Another way to search for a contact is by using the alphabet scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact is listed with a photo, name, default phone number and a call button. Viewing a contact has been redesigned with social networking in mind. Here a tabbed interface is used again. The default tab is the View tap ? it shows all the info for that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is the Log tab ? it lists all communications with that contact, from calls to messages from Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Which brings us to the third tab ? Community. It allows you to link a contact with their Facebook, Twitter and Bebo accounts. When you do, a small icon of whatever social networking site it was appears over the contact?s photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is mostly unchanged. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes unneeded info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s the Groups tab. The default groups are Starred in Android (you can ?star? contacts, that is mark them as favorite), then Facebook, Twitter and Bebo (though these show only if you have an account for that site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An additional app, Favorite contacts, shows a grid with the contact photos of all the contacts that you?ve starred. Most of it is eye candy, but the app can be quite handy too ? tapping on a contact brings up the options to call the contact, send a message or email or edit the contact details. If there is more than one number for the contact you can select which one to use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now it?s time to talk about the fourth tab of the Contacts app, the Dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer shows a virtual phone keypad that lets you dial a number, but it doesn?t support smart dialing. The Contacts tab is the better option if you?re dialing a contact from your phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the actual calls themselves, audio quality during a call is decent but it's a bit quiet even at maximum volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the LG GW620 fared well ? it scored a Good mark, so you won?t have trouble hearing it beep.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging, how many email clients do you need?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 can handle all common types of messages with ease - SMS, MMS and email. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of integration of that content as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating as the text box only takes a single line of the screen, leaving you very little space to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail is one thing that you can't expect to have changed much compared to other Android handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted, spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Email app doesn?t do conversation style display of messages ? it sticks with the folder structure. The Inbox folder shows the number of messages that have been retrieved and how many of them are unread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a custom LG My Email application ? it can handle several email accounts and is dead simple to set up. It also has handy shortcuts to email contacts and the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, for Gmail, the Google-made app is the best and the generic email app that comes with Android does more than fine for other email services. So, My Email seems a little redundant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My Email seems particularly unnecessary when you count in the Moxier suite of apps, which include Microsoft Exchange support for email. The Moxier Mail suite offers Direct Push synchronization with Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 and 2007 and supports synchronization of contacts, calendar and tasks. The suite is also available from the Android Market, but it will set you back 25 bucks, so good on LG for bundling it with the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only on-screen keyboard you get with the LG GW620 is a phone keypad. The hardware QWERTY keyboard will be handling all the workload here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery looks nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 has a pretty attractive gallery. The 3D effects and smooth scrolling contribute to a pretty good user experience in general.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those 3D effects are reserved for Android 2.0 devices only, but LG have somehow ported them to ver. 1.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual shortcut that allows you to share your images over email, MMS, MySpace or Picasa is now updated to support the My Email and Moxier Mail apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, sharing multiple photos at a time isn?t available and neither is sending images via Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 supports a couple of zooming methods ? you can use the onscreen virtual controls or you can zoom straight to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, zooming and panning is fast enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Media Player does DivX/XviD, plays music too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Media Player app does what it says on the tin ? and for the most part does it well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default view shows you the list of videos on the memory card. The player interface is simple and easy to use ? it offers the playback controls and automatically switches to full screen when you tilt the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pleasant surprise is the built-in support for DivX and XviD videos. Unfortunately, playback is limited to a maximum video resolution of 400 by 240 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s better than usual ? built-in DivX/XviD support is rare on most OSes and Android is no exception. But you?ll have to re-encode videos if you want to watch them on the LG GW620.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some reason the app kept crashing when there were .WMV files in the folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DivX wasn?t the only surprise that the Media Player had in store. It?s a music player too! But we almost missed that ? to get to the music player you have to press the menu key and choose Music. Pressing the Back button brings you right back to the list of videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music in the Media Player app is skinned to resemble other LG music players, but aside from a sleeker look and a few animated transitions, it doesn?t really bring anything new to the table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no equalizers, no visualizations ? nothing the vanilla player doesn?t have and nothing to really enthuse the audiophiles out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not including additional functionality is one thing, but why didn?t LG set this up as the default music player? It gives the impression LG did a half-baked job at skinning Android. Remember the two different styles of menu icons? It?s a minor thing, but a noticeable one).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is still the same though<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Selecting Music on the main menu (or pressing the dedicated Music key on the side) launches the default Android music player. Again, it?s an odd choice considering they?ve taken the time to add a skinned Media player. Anyway, the functionality (the lack of it mostly) is the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The core functionality is all there and the looks are mostly fine but there is still some catching up to do before the best in class are matched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort tracks by artist or album or you can browse them by playlists. The now playing user interface - though very sleek and more comfortable - doesn't offer too many new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While a song is playing, the track info is visible in the notification area and it?s a handy shortcut to the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the well known gaps are still there, like no equalizer presets and no alternative visualizations when album art isn?t available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part is the built-in search functionality that allows you to search a specific song title in Google or YouTube.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 is equipped with an FM radio in addition to the music player. Its interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 48 stations as favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that we didn?t like about the radio app is that it can?t play on the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite being on the quiet side as fat as headphones volume is concerned the LG GW620 has pretty decent audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cut-off extreme bass frequencies are probably our only (not quite significant) grudge against it with the rest of the readings being very good (distortion levels) to excellent (stereo crosstalk, noise levels and dynamic range).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera is heavy-handed with compression<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 is outfitted with a 5-megapixel auto-focus camera and a LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface got a complete makeover and it?s almost a one-to-one copy of the camera interface on the LG Viewty Smart for example. That has its good and bad points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is pretty simple but still finds room for some of the essential functions on the screen. Selecting the auto-focus mode, the flash mode and the exposure compensations is a single tap away. The controls on the left can be hidden to free up space in the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between still camera and camcorder is done with the trademark slider/shutter combo (virtual) we?ve seen on previous LGs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here comes the not-so-good part ? the extended settings menu. It uses the well-known rotating dial and its problem is that it?s quite slow. You can access only one item at a time, to get to the others you need to rotate the dial, which is rather slow on two accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t skip over items ? you need to rotate over all of them till you get to the one you need, and the dial can be unresponsive sometimes. Using a simple list - while not as pretty - would have been much faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Usually, only the rarely used settings go into the extended settings menu, but in the LG GW620 things like shoot mode and scene mode are buried in there. And scene mode was supposed to be a quick way to set up the camera for a particular kind of shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shooting experience is average ? the camera is a little slow to focus and so is snapping a shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the image quality there are three forces at play here that give their best to mess it up. First is the noisy image sensor, then comes the poorly tweaked noise reduction that smears everything so that there?s banding over the smooth gradients; and finally the heavy JPEG compression that leaves a lot of compression artifacts and nasty pixelization in the worse cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downsized photos in favorable lighting conditions are usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A strange and very unpleasant bug we encountered is that when you set macro mode, it gets stuck ? even though the icon shows ?auto?, all the non-macro photos come out blurry.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the LG GW620. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can certainly see a pinkish tint to the center of the frame.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera on the LG GW620 performs quite poorly. It shoots QVGA videos at 30 frames per second, which doesn?t sound particularly exciting. However the compression is too heavy and the videos don?t usually make the full 30 fps. Overall, the clips are good for MMS only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is almost identical to the one on the still camera. The same criticisms we leveled at the still camera UI apply here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG GW620 camera video sample</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity, except the poor Bluetooth support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 offers the full connectivity package. It covers the basics with quad-band GSM/EDGE but also offers speedy connectivity over 3G with 7.2Mbps HSDPA and HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For local connectivity, there?s Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.0 (just the headset profile though, you can?t send or receive files). The GW620 features a built-in GPS receiver with A-GPS support, microUSB and a hot swappable microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a 3.5mm audio jack so you can plug in your favorite pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi and Bluetooth switches come in handy when you need to quickly turn on or off either wireless connectivity option. A switch for GPS and even an Airplane mode toggle would have been great additions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing your data couldn't be easier - it's just that you mainly sync with the Google services. For those of you who prefer desktop syncing with Outlook or Outlook Express, the Moxier Sync app comes in handy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good web browser, but lacking Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Great web browsing has been an undoubted Android strength since day one. The LG GW620 is hardly an exception here and even benefits further from the hardware QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You don?t need to click anything to enter an address - just hit a key when you are not filling a web form and you can start typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty minimalist. You get the address bar, which is docked at the top of you screen so scrolling down and hiding it isn?t an option and a small arrow at the right side of the screen. Tapping this arrow reveals the LG custom interface for the browser, which is actually a bar with six shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those let you reload a page, go back and forward, access your bookmarks, open a new tab or check the browser settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hitting the menu key reveals six more shortcuts. You can start typing an address, search and select text, check out your downloads or exit the web browser from here. The final button reveals even more options (bookmarks, window overview, settings etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately you don?t get double-tap or one-finger zooming on the GW620. And since pinch-zooming isn?t even an option you only get to use the on-screen controls for that purpose. There is also no text reflow so LG?s first Android handset is a rather poor performer in terms of zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least panning offers two options ? both sweep gestures across the screen and the hardware arrows on the QWERTY keyboard can do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no Flash support on the LG GW620. Neither Flash games nor Flash videos are an option. You do get to watch YouTube but it uses the preinstalled YouTube application rather than the web browser itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer well stocked, office document reader preinstalled<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 comes with the usual set of organizing apps. We are starting to see a positive trend among recent Android-running handsets to have a document viewer preinstalled, rather than making the user download one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is Quickoffice and it supports viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and PDF but only their Office 2003 versions. This time you don?t need a dedicated PDF reader but you still have to get the paid app for editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a voice recorder, which might be pretty useful for making audio notes and a nicely touch-optimized calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, clicking the SNS icon in the main menu gives you an app designed to help you update your Facebook and Twitter profiles. You can also keep track of your friends? activities in this app.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google maps and GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GW620 comes with a built-in GPS receiver. It got satellite lock in a minute and a half even without the A-GPS on, which is a pretty decent achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and of course makes an appearance on the LG GW620 as well. Its voice-guided navigation version, the Google Maps Navigation is available only in the US, the rest of the world is in no luck here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still plan a route and track your current location so it is better than nothing but you still have to rely on network data for downloading the map info. Unfortunately, once again double-tapping doesn?t work so your only option for zooming in and out in Google Maps are the on-screen controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street View mode is supported and it?s probably the most fun part of Google Maps ? it gives you a 360-degree view of the surroundings where it?s available. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like you?re taking a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t a dedicated nav application, so if you want one, you will have to visit the Android market and pick one yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market gives you loads of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG GW620 comes with Android 1.5 and the older version of the Android market. The changes are purely cosmetic so it?s not much of an issue. Of course the Android version number is somewhat limiting here but there are still thousands of apps available for download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and below them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option to display them all at once, but you will probably need days to browse the entire list that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button, type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?file manager?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screenshots.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The low-profile LG GW620 turned out a decent gadget indeed. A solid QWERTY messenger with proper computing power, it will meet most users? needs without breaking the bank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Suitable for a younger audience in both design and software (social networking stuff is still more or less an age thing), the LG GW620 comes with an appropriate price tag and looks eager to serve a wide base of potential upgraders coming from the Cookie and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the company?s first Android-based smartphone we?re surprised it didn?t get enough publicity. It could be their long declared commitment to Windows Mobile (soon to be Windows Phone) or else, but for whatever reason they chose not to promote their Android device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The consequences of this will probably be less handsets sold in the short-term and not quite enough support in the long run. And since after-sale support is vital to any modern smartphone (unless you are changing them every three months or so) this probably reduces the consumer value of the GW620. One thing to look out for would be potential OS upgrades but we don?t think it?s too likely. We?d be glad to be proven wrong of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s take a look at a few alternatives of the LG GW620 that you can find on the smartphone market today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP and the MB220 DEXT are two QWERTY-enabled droids to offer you the MOTOBLUR UI, which takes social network integration to a whole new level. The BACKFLIP is so unafraid to bend the rules it will rate high with users who like to be different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola BACKFLIP ? MB220 DEXT</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have the extra dollars to spare then by all means, check out the Motorola MILESTONE. Motorola are tipped to be working on the second Google-branded phone, which should pack a QWERTY slide-out keyboard and this is telling of the response to their other devices in this class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola MILESTONE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this stage, the Milestone is the top droid messenger and looks quite a bargain as its current price (some 100 US dollars more expensive than the GW620). We do think though LG are targeting a different set of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not caught in the Android hype, Nokia still have a couple of handsets to try and upset the GW620 sales. The Nokia N97 mini and the upcoming C6 are the Symbian-running rivals. The N97 mini is a metal-clad messenger that aims to serve the same demographics as the GW620. The Nokia C6 is likely to come so cheap, it may as well become the ultimate entry-level smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia N97 mini ? Nokia C6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the MOTOBLUR-equipped Motorola messengers are certainly easy to recommend to social networking buffs. And if you want the ultimate performer, the MILESTONE is your kind of phone. So, where does the LG GW620 stand in all this? A more than decent spec sheet and the performance to back it up ? it?s a smartphone that - above all - will put you at ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geeks won?t be wowed and the GW620 won?t change the Android game. But it comes on a well set stage and million Cookies are giving the cue.</paragraph>
