			<paragraph>Samsung are not quite the standard-setter in communicator devices but are obviously keen to have their say. Playing catch up seems well in order for a debut but we guess someone here is set to play for keeps. The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is a generously spec'd device that's poised to tackle the best in the class and even raise the bet. While sheer size and scope confine it to a niche, the Samsung communicator might be just the right option for those served by that niche.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having acquired a pre-release sample of the side-slider PocketPC we are squeezing in a short preview, introducing its most important features. The chunky bloke does give a decent first impression, but handling will be the ultimate test. For starters, let's look at the key items on the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO's balance sheet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung are obviously eyeing market penetration at all levels. The B7610 OmniaPRO is their scout in a long colonized territory. HTC.are clearly the key target, though the communicator game is competitive enough with XPERIA, Nseries and Eseries all keen to take the lead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A heavyweight fight it sure is but let's focus on this one contender here. The OmniaPRO will hit the scales and warm up with a hardware inspection on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO's dimensions of 112.6 x 57.8 x 16.2 mm are just a tad easier to swallow than the heft of the HTC Touch Pro2. The Samsung is also almost 20 grams lighter, but frankly, both are massive handsets indeed so the differences aren't that obvious.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Massive body and all, the B7610 OmniaPRO is not much of a charmer. Even the coolest finish wouldn't hide the beer belly though we've seen some do better. XPERIA ring a bell? Samsung have tried to get more creative on the rear with the red battery cover. Decent though it is, it doesn't quite match the rest of the handset's exterior and appears a bit out of place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large 3.5" AMOLED touchscreen of WVGA resolution dominates the front panel. The high resolution and the AMOLED technology guarantee excellent image quality, though the 65K-color limitation of the WinMo OS results in occasional banding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's mostly visible in single color gradients and the large high-res screen makes it more prominent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sensitivity is decent for a resistive screen but nowhere near the experience of the capacitive-like units in Samsung S8000 Jet and the Samsung M8910 Pixon12. Samsung claim the OmniaPRO display is advanced R-type but our pre-release sample doesn't really feel superior to the company's multimedia flagships. We will wait for a final unit before we pass our judgment on this one though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main issue of the display is sunlight legibility. On a bright sunny day the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is quite difficult to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen there are three hardware controls - the Call and End buttons, and the menu key (Start menu if you prefer). They're prominent enough for comfortable handling and have solid press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the front panel are the ambient light sensor, the proximity sensor and the video-call camera. There's another sensor up there but we haven't quite figured out what exactly it does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features the volume rocker and the mode switch. The latter is a handy control that lets you to toggle work and leisure mode on your B7610 OmniaPRO. You can assign different user interface settings each and alternate them with a single click.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The right side of Samsung B7610 hosts the screen lock button and the dedicated camera key. Those are both large and tactile enough to allow trouble-free operation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is perfectly plain with no controls whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the B7610, in contrast, is rather crowded. This is where the 3.5mm standard audio jack, microUSB slot and the stylus compartment are placed. Both connection ports are covered with plastic lids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone open reveals the four-row QWERTY keyboard. We are pretty fond of the sliding mechanism as it locks firmly in both positions and slides in and out very smoothly. The spring-assisted slide responds readily to a gentle flick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard itself is a real treat. The keys are large and provide decent feedback so you can type at enviable speed. In fact, just for the sake of experiment, a good part of this preview was written on the handset itself. It wasn't the quickest way to do it of course, but it surely doesn't get much better in mobile phone terms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO accommodates the 5 megapixel camera lens, dual LED flash and the loudspeaker grill. There is a slightly protruding frame around the camera lens to protect it from scratches but there is no protective cover so you still need to be pretty careful with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is hot-swappable but is located under the back panel, so you will have to remove the cover every time you change cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1500 mAh battery is the other noteworthy thing below the back panel. It is so powerful that it managed to get us going through more than two days of extensive usage of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO fares pretty well as far as ergonomics are concerned but will it manage to impress as much software-wise.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz UI keeps improving<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO runs on the Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional OS but you wouldn't guess that at first sight. If it wasn't for the start menu icon at the top right to give it away you might spend quite some time confused that you are working with a Samsung feature-phone instead. The company has done an excellent job of customizing the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company's proprietary TouchWiz UI is installed on top of the Microsoft OS and covers it so completely that it's hard to come across those boring native menus. From the phonebook to the settings menu, everything is covered by the customized interface. Even the settings themselves have been reorganized to resemble those of the Samsung non-smartphone touchscreen handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO you gen a different homescreen for the work and the life mode, which we mentioned earlier. While both use widgets the work mode has a completely new layout, while the life one is rather similar to what we saw on the Samsung I8000 Omnia II for example. The widgets for the work mode are also different and generally more practical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets in work mode are arranged as tabs on you scrollable homescreen in a customizable order. Each individual tab is also scrollable sideways if there is more content that needs to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The life mode widgets are the usual mini applications that you can arrange freely on the three different screens available. In either mode, if the user needs to place a new widget on the screen all that has to be done is click the arrow at the bottom left corner of the homescreen and slide the widget bar out. Getting rid of an unwanted widget is done by dropping it back to the bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz approach is quite similar to the one we witnessed on the Samsung i900 Omnia but the B7610 OmniaPRO has two key advantages over its predecessor. For one - the widgets interface has been nicely improved since, both visually and functionally with the two modes probably being the nicest touch. The other great benefit of the B7610 OmniaPRO is the fact that this time the Samsung engineers decided to go all the way and customize the interface inside out. Not seeing the dull looks of the native screens anywhere is a huge boost to user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Task Manager is available through the custom Settings menu provided by Samsung. The Task manager not only does it display the currently running processes, but also their RAM and CPU footprint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Task switcher that doesn't display as much info about the running apps but allows you to switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unluckily there isn't a back button on the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO. It's not that the handset has lost some functionality because of this, but you will have to reach for the close or ok button at the top right corner of each screen. A key comfortably placed nearer your thumb would certainly have improved usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pretty confident that the omnipresent TouchFLO 3D interface will be ported to the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO at some stage. However there is no need to rush getting it - as you can see the handset has quite a lot to offer itself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Touch Player is a welcome upgrade<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have wisely decided to give WinMo users a new touch-friendly media player and spare them the inconvenience of installing a third-party one to substitute for the poor default WMPlayer. The one that comes on the B7610 OmniaPRO is identical to the one we already saw on the Omnia II we previewed not so long ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It handles both video and audio files, supports playlists and has the standard album/artist/tracks sections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two main views available in the B7610 OmniaPRO player. The first one is the Library - at the top you have six tabs: all music, albums, artists, genres, videos plus Now Playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you switch into play mode, you see a simple and clean interface. It has the standard music buttons you would expect - volume, next/previous track, play/pause and shuffle, while the album art fills most of the screen above them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options menu offers the ability to play the music faster/slower or to set the track as a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Playing video is very simple - it's done the same way as an audio file. The player interface looks the same, but tapping twice turns on the fullscreen mode. It has the same control buttons as the standard one, but everything is changed for landscape orientation and there is no taskbar at the top or empty black spaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the OmniaPRO has full DivX and XviD video support, it successfully managed to playback all test videos we trew at it - up to VGA resolution, of course.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photo Album is the main picture viewing app. It sorts the photos by month and shows the first six from every album. Scrolling is easy as a finger sweep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting an image loads it in a single view where you can zoom or slide to the next one. There are dedicated on-screen buttons for zooming, which toggle on and off automatically. Double tap zooming is also available although, unlike the Omnia II, the B7610 OmniaPRO zooms in on the center of the image rather than the spot where you have tapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also implemented the one-finger zooming we came to know from the S8000 Jet and M8910 Pixon12. You just need to hold it on the screen for a second and then drag up or down for zooming in or out. This method works in both galleries (as well as the web browser) and it is at the very least as convenient as the pinching gesture on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is, of course, slideshow functionality and you can adjust the direction, slide time and transition effect. It works fine and combined with the huge screen turns the phone into a perfect slideshow device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilting the phone side-ways or opening the QWERTY keyboard shows a really cool alternative view. It displays your photos are in a 3D arc and they slightly overlap each other. You then scroll them with a sweeping finger gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an alternative arc of thumbnails crossing the current one - and it holds the folders. So with a single move you can scroll either the images within a folder or the whole list of folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is pretty smooth and generally one of the nicest gallery apps as far as user-experience is concerned. Samsung's attempt to create a superior photo browsing app that sports 3D graphics and an innovative interface is really commendable. And so is their general effort to give WinMo the total interface makeover that it needing for quite some time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is capable of taking 5 megapixel photos and capturing VGA clips. There is a dual LED flash to assist with low-light pictures and videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface is just the same as on its Omnia II cousin. Comfortable and nicely touch-optimized, it has most of the controls you'll need in the two vertical bars on each side of the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic options are here - ISO, white balance, default storage, stabilizer, etc. You can see the presence of WDR, which continues to makes its way into many recent Samsung cameraphones. You can switch the default storage between the phone memory and the microSD card. Hip camera features like geo-tagging, face detection and smile shutter are also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung B7610 OmniaPro pulls of decent image quality with a good amount of resolved detail and reatively noise-free photos. However our pre-release unit produced photos with rather low contrast, which look pretty dull at first sight. If you are into post-processing your photos you will probably like this approach as it preserves more image information and gives you more to work with. However the rest of the users would be better off with the processsing algorithm that Samsung usually applies to their cameraphones as it give more punchy output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go several Smasung B7610 OmniaPRO samples for you to check out. Just have in mind that this is a pre-release unit and quite a lot might change before it actually start selling so there's no need to rush to any conclusions just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is able to shoot VGA videos at the sweet 30 fps. Recorder in the mp4 format those have pretty decent quality with a decent amount of resolved detail. However the low contrast and undersaturated colors give the videos a rather dull look that won't really impress many users. And since we seriously doubt it that many people are post-processing the videos taken with their phones, we really hope that Samsung will fix this before the handset hits the shelves. It's not a hard task really and we are quite sure the users will be thankful for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO video for you to enjoy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is a very good handset overall with capabilities that can easily match the HTC Touch Pro2 class-leader. In fact the faster CPU and the AMOLED screen are quite significant improvements that one can receive by choosing the Samsung over the HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch Pro2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the Taiwanese company, has a lot more experience in producing this kind of devices and it shows. The TouchFLO3D UI looks much better suited for business-minded handsets like the two in question, than the multimedia-focused TouchWiz. The new features that Samsung introduced for the OmniaPRO do count here but only for reducing the distance, rather than earning it a victory. One mustn't forget however that those are WinMo handsets we are talking about and porting the interface of one of them to run on the other is just a matter of time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are pretty certain that the B7610 OmniaPRO won't sell as much as the Touch Pro2, if only for the larger fan mass that HTC have among WinMo users. However getting pretty close to the best is usually considered a huge success for newbie, let alone beating them at their own game now and then. And it seems to us that the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO is pretty capable of doing exactly that.</paragraph>
