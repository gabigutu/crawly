			<paragraph>Samsung M7600 Beat DJ is one of those mobiles that stake everything on a unique and exclusive feature. Designed to stand out, the M7600 takes enhanced music playback capabilities to unprecedented heights. Allowing you to mix your own music right the way you like it, the Beat DJ opens up an empty market niche and makes the M7600 a standard-setter. The entertainment package is complete with the nice touch user interface and relevant design.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung M7600 Beat DJ at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the Sony Ericsson Walkman family and Nokia's XpressMusic line compete to deliver more and more functionality on the music playback front Samsung M7600 have set their efforts on turning a small rounded handset into a DJ deck - sounds an exciting job really, but let's see how well it spins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us on the next page for our Samsung M7600 Beat DJ scoop.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung M7600 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7600 may sound big on paper, but that's mostly due to the rounded top and bottom. At 112 x 51 x 13.9 mm and a weight of 99.7 grams, the M7600 Beat DJ is quite pocket-friendly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The rounded edges do make it quite an unusual handset. At times you might even wonder which way is up. We still like the idea and it feels the Samsung M7600 can benefit from the distinctive design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M7600 Beat DJ body is made of high quality plastic, painted in three different colors. Metallic gloss frames the display and the touch-sensitive scroll up front. Eye-catching violet is used on the sides and moire-patterned dark grey on the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display there's the secondary video-call camera and the ambient light sensor. There is also a proximity sensor that is used for locking the display when you hold the handset next to your ear during calls. Right below them is the nicely shaped earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The central part of the front is taken up by the 2.8" 16M-color OLED touchscreen display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call and End keys and the Back button are located at the bottom perfectly matching the design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, maybe you think we've covered everything on the front panel but let's have a closer look. Notice the empty space between the screen and the call buttons? It's a semicircular touchpad, which mostly gets used in music applications. Together with the touchscreen it forms a circular scroll that stretches from the bottom third of the display to the receiver keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the M7600 Beat DJ is quite crowded. First, there's the lanyard eyelet, followed by the handy volume rocker. Next comes the lock slider and finally - the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is used for charging the Samsung Beat DJ, as well as for connecting it to a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Beat DJ right side hosts the microSD slot and the dedicated camera key. The last thing we must mention is the 3.5mm audio jack on the top of the phone. It's covered by a protective cap, so you may not spot it at first look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two stereo speakers are symmetrically placed on the curved top and bottom of Samsung Beat DJ. The 3.5mm audio jack is placed dead center on the top of the M7600 and is covered by a protective cap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the M7600 Beat DJ there is a 3 megapixel sensor and the LED flash, along with a small self-portrait mirror. The surface offers secure grip and is generally fingerprint resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7600 Beat DJ is incredibly pocket-friendly and leaves the impression of a really compact device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7600 Beat DJ comes with the latest implementation of the TouchWiz user interface much like the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH. Lively, colorful and pleasantly thumbable - the latest reincarnation of the TouchWiz UI has inherited all the virtues of its predecessors and adds some interesting new stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have missed it for some reason, the widgets are basically convenient mini-applications for customizing your home screen. Some of the widgets are more practical such as the calendar or the world clock, even the image gallery or the mp3/radio player, while others are just for fun such as the aforementioned 'quit smoking' and 'go on a diet' widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, all the widgets are stored on a bar on the left which you can toggle by using the small arrow in the lower left corner. You can pick which widgets to display by simply dragging them onto the display and placing them where you want. If you want to remove any of them, all you need to do is drag them back to the bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leaving the homescreen and the new icon graphics aside the Beat DJ unit we had didn't differ much from what we've already seen in other devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that the the Beat DJ has been announced however, it turns out that Samsung have added a new Disk UI, which makes the music player interface quite a lot like a jukebox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get a really good look of the novelties at the Samsung booth and we'll report back to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>you can still check out some interface screenshots to get an idea of the rest of phone features - messaging, applications, organizer, FM radio.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Comfortable finger-optimized galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like in Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH, the Samsung M7600 Beat DJ makes use of two different picture galleries. Accessed from different parts of the menu they are optimized for touch operation and are decently user-friendly. The first is an inherent part of the file manager and accessing it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep you fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list. The sweeping is really responsive and fluid and we do like it more than we did on the Pixon - just like in S8300. Then again, the capacitive screen might be the reason for this and not some software improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alternative to the picture gallery is PhotoBrowser. There is a dedicated icon in the main menu and is the quickest way to access your images. As in the Pixon there is a scroll bar to move through the pictures. Besides that you can choose form three sorting settings - by file name, time and color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The galleries also have slideshows and an accelerometer-based browsing feature. It lets you browse pictures in fullscreen landscape mode by simply tilting your phone on its side (plus, of course, you get automatic rotation of the photos by changing the device orientation).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS-equipped<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In all likelihood, the M7600 Beat DJ will have the built-in GPS chip used for geotagging and some Java applications only, along the lines of Samsung Pixon. There is no navigation software supplied with our test handset, but that may be added later on at an extra cost.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Superb music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The unique music player created especially for M7600 will impress you with its simple and attractive interface, and options galore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's take a look on the Now playing screen. On the top we have three buttons - turning on the BeatDJ, view the playlist and settings. Both track lists on BeatDJ and the music player have similar view and scrolling between them is available from the virtual scroll wheel at the bottom or the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next line of buttons is the 5.1 virtual surround on/off button, shuffle and repeat. The M7600 has an energy efficient ICEPower audio amplifier by Bang and Olufsen. As usual it's got nothing to do with sound quality, but only with battery efficiency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard music controls are at the bottom - two skip buttons and play/pause. The fast-forward and rewind commands are handled via the touch-sensitive arch that extends over the music keys. It's really fun and amazingly responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've gotta remember that Samsung have pimped the user experience even more later on in the development of the Beat DJ. So the retail version will have the so-called Disc UI that mimics a jukebox. It looks pretty nice in real, we'll do our best to give you the scoop of the niceties as soon as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Newly named, but well known, the Find Music service is also part of the music player. It's a music recognition service similar to Sony Ericsson TrackID.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BeatDJ rocks the crowd<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BeatDJ is the application, which turns your phone into small DJ mixer. It can be run from the music menu or directly through the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We faced a very intuitive and clean interface again. BeatDJ is landscape oriented and its center is taken by a large circle, which takes after a vinyl record. There are no special visualizations here, just the track name, album and running time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several mixer controls - REC, Scratch, Filters, and Samples. The REC starts recording your tweaks of the music. Scratch, quite logically, turns the circle into a virtual vinyl, which you can spin on the touchscreen to do scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up are the 10 filters available for tweaking the music - they include looping, echo, and tempo change to name a few. You can have only two active filters at one time though. If you start a third, the first one is automatically turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally there are the Samples library - there are 20 preinstalled. Basically this means that while a track is playing you can add some audio sample like a voice, chimes or a siren. When you choose the one you want a small "play" button appears in the center of the vinyl. You can press it as many times as you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't find a way to add our own samples to the library, but we hope that the retail unit will offer that as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For scrolling between the filters and audio samples you use the virtual touch scroll wheel. This, combined with the virtual vinyl really creates a unique interactive user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Beat DJ is quite well implemented and fun to use, even in our pre-release unit. The only thing that anyone could possibly miss is a way to mix two separate tracks. But hey, we guess two virtual records onscreen and a fader is just too much to ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at what the Samsung Beat DJ is capable of even at this early stage:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera is really nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7600 Beat DJ features a nice 3 megapixel autofocus camera. In addition to it there is a LED flash helping in low-light conditions and recording night videos. Unfortunately, as with most LED flashes, its range is hardly more than a meter or two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Beat DJ is capable of taking photos with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. The videos recorded by the M7600 went up to VGA resolution at 20 fps (15fps according to the official specs), which barely qualifies as nice so we expect that to be fixed on the retail unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual pictures taken with the camera are a nice surprise ? very good detail and colors. The noise reduction is a bit aggressive at times, but no biggie. Image processing however is certain to go under more changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall image quality is quite good and we are happy with all shots. You can take a look the full-size samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized and is certainly one of the most comfortable camera interfaces on a touchscreen device we've seen recently.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The M7600 beat DJ web browser is similar to those used in Pixon or S8300. It has zooming and full-screen options, plus the landscape view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser is nicely touch optimized and offers auto screen rotation. Hyperlinks require two clicks, just like with the Symbian S60 5th Edition web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser managed perfectly most pages we threw at it and even succeed in loading some simple Flash banners. Unfortunately, you will not be able to play YouTube video with it beside the lower quality mobile version found at m.youtube.com.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a distinct design and a unique key feature, the Samsung M7600 Beat DJ sure knows how to make a first impression. But what's best, the first attempt is by no means undercooked or superficial. The BeatDJ is of course the right kind of bait for the right target audience but it's nonetheless well made and focused.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OLED touchscreen display is really cool and should certainly be counted as one of the key selling points of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other key feature, of course, is the enhanced music capabilities. BeatDJ gives you a host of options for remixing and tweaking your favorite tracks and why not even share them with your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice 3 megapixel camera has really nice image quality even at this pre-release stage. Combined with the geo-tagging option thanks to the built-in GPS, the Beat DJ will cater for the most common imaging necessities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are looking forward to see a final unit, because Samsung M7600 Beat DJ promises solid amount of fun. It seems to have got the balance quite right and the music bar quite high.</paragraph>
