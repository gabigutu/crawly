			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having earned its place in the Android hall of fame, the original Galaxy S can start thinking about retirement. And these won?t be thoughts of fear and worry. With a replacement on its way, the veteran can look forward to getting the respects it deserves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And what a replacement it is. Samsung?s Galaxy lineup is home of some of the world?s finest droids. But the I9100 Galaxy S II is special. The forerunner was in contention for the Best Droid title and more than once got a hand on it. But it was only a matter of time for the competition to eventually catch up and even get ahead. The Galaxy S II aims to put Samsung back in the lead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The success of the original Galaxy S was based on four key features: the big Super AMOLED screen, the processing power, the 720p video recording and the ever evolving Android. The Galaxy S II is not just a cursory update ? it upgrades all the key ingredients of its predecessor. The Super AMOLED Plus looks better and is more power efficient. The powerful dual-core processor and faster graphics make the Galaxy S II a silky smooth performer in web browsing and media.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of that, Samsung has really listened to the users. They?ve added a LED flash to the camera ? and 8 MP sounds like they finally mean business. Not to mention the full HD videos were quite impressive. There is even more ? the Galaxy S II has ditched the glossy battery cover in favor of a textured surface that makes the phone appear both more mature and durable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II is slightly bigger than its predecessor, but thinner and lighter. It?s a monster of a smartphone with a killer screen and premium imaging. You can bet the Gingerbread ticking inside feels right at home. And though this isn?t the first time we?re about to see it in action, we?d gladly spend more quality time with it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The slim profile and the new textured back of the Galaxy S II are the key design features. It certainly isn?t the most compact of handsets but a 4.3? touchscreen phone just couldn?t have been better in terms of ergonomics and handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s plain to see, the new Galaxy S II is bigger than its predecessor. 3mm taller and 2mm wider to be precise ? and that?s a small price to pay for superior internals and bigger screen. The best part of all is that it?s only 8.5mm thick and weighs 116g ? 3 grams less than the Galaxy S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are quite fond of the I9010 Galaxy S Giorgio Armani and prior to the MWC we hoped the Galaxy S II would use some of its styling. Well, there is no metal here, but the battery cover comes close enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty much inherited from the original Galaxy S ? the rounded edges, capacitive controls and bits of glossy plastic at the sides and below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rough-textured battery cover is almost paper thin. We guess this is one of the reasons for the phone?s reduced weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But while the rear seems to be the place where most of the changes occurred, the screen of course will get most of the attention. We?ve already commented on the new Super AMOLED Plus screen in our head-to-head comparison with the LG Optimus 2X. But here are the basics once again in case you?ve missed it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first generation of Super AMOLED screens use a PenTile matrix of two subpixels per pixel. In the new Super AMOLED Plus screens, each pixel has three subpixels just as regular LCD panels..The image below demonstrates the difference.Bare in mind these zoomed in samples show a patch of 4 pixels in a group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the original Galaxy S and the Galaxy S II have screens of equal resolution: WVGA, or 480 x 800 pixels. The SuperAMOLED Plus screen of the Galaxy S II has 50% more subpixels, making it sharper. Small text and fine texture is where it matters most but, overall, the difference is barely noticeable to the naked eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SuperAMOLED Plus screen of the Galaxy S II has exceptional viewing angles but the old screen in the Samsung Galaxy S isn't half bad either. Especially compared to a regular LCD unit, as you can see below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Super AMOLED Plus display is said to have improved brightness and lower power consumption. We?ll leave the battery tests for the full-featured review, but we did test the brightness levels. It turned out the SuperAMOLED Plus screen is no brighter than the previous generation used in the original Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The response of the capacitive unit is top notch. The screen is not over-sensitive ? it will register only proper taps, not a thumb hovering close. Just like the original Galaxy S, the Galaxy S II display has scratch resistant Gorilla glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we find three keys below the display. The capacitive Menu and Back buttons are on either side of a hardware home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are large enough to allow comfortable use and the capacitive touch technology makes sure the transition between them and the screen is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you can see the earpiece, a couple of sensors and the 2 megapixel front facing camera, which can do video-calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone features the 3.5mm jack and a secondary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom are the microUSB port and the mouthpiece. The microUSB port supports MHL,enabling HD video (up to 1080p) and multi-channel audio output. Read more on the MHL tech in our blog here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II we find the volume rocker and the lanyard eyelet, while the power/lock key is symmetrically placed across on the right. There?s no dedicated shutter key, which is a letdown for the FullHD video-capable 8 megapixel snapper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel camera lens and the single LED flash share a common metal-framed plate at the back. The loudspeaker grill is the other thing of note here, in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the battery cover is made of super thin textured plastic. It covers almost the entire phone?s back and is fingerprint-resistant. It?s a bit hard to remove but the plus side is it fits tightly in place, no squeaks and wobble.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the battery cover you can see the microSD card slot, the SIM compartment and the 1650 mAh battery. The microSD card is unfortunately not hot-swappable. Surprisingly, the SIM card is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is a phone of commendable ergonomics. Surely it?s a big one, but slim and lightweight. It?s comfortable to handle. Better build and better looks than the original Galaxy S is good news for potential upgraders.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Latest TouchWiz lives in the Gingerbread house<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II runs Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread out of the box with TouchWiz 4.0 customizations ? basically, the latest software available. The differences are there but they're subtle and the experience has been refined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of trying to describe them though it would be easier to just show you. Here?s a quick walkthrough video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get up to 7 screens to populate with widgets, but don?t have to use all at once. The numbered dots that identify the homescreen panes serve as a scroll bar too. A press and hold on the dots lets you scroll sideways through the resized images of the available homescreen panes in one short go rather than with several swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do a pinching gesture to zoom out and add or delete homescreens. A press and hold on any homescreen (or Menu, Add) lets you pick one of four ways to customize the homescreen ? add widgets, add shortcuts or folders, or change wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In screen edit mode, widgets are docked at the bottom and scrolled horizontally. When you?ve found the one you need it can be dragged onto the screen. It?s similar to what we?ve seen in Bada, but with some 3D eye candy. Shortcuts and folders are picked from vertically-scrollable grids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the widgets can be resized just by dragging the corner much like with widgets on the MotoBLUR UI. It certainly gives you a lot of flexibility over use of screen real estate. Important widgets can be expanded to show more info, while the less frequently used ones can be made smaller to conserve space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S II has four buttons docked at the bottom of its homescreen, which stay there even when you open the menu. You can remove or change them (except the home button which is fixed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen. You can add new pages manually, by dragging an app to a new screen in edit mode. You can add folders to the menu too ? just drag shortcuts from the menu to the Make Folder icon and give it a name. The same trick can be used to create new menu pages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders cannot be put inside folders and they use the icon of one of the apps inside, making them terribly hard to spot. We hope Samsung fixes that since we spent a few minutes looking for our new folder when it was right in front of us. Also, we wish we could dock a folder in the bottom row of four shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the launcher is in edit mode, you can uninstall applications (only the ones that you installed) just by tapping them. Tapping a folder will delete it, returning the apps back to the flat menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area, one of the Android strengths, has five switches for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sound and rotation-lock. These are always accessible (unless there?s an app running in fullscreen mode, e.g. a game).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s the task manager too, which lets you terminate apps and clear RAM. You don?t normally need to do that since Android is pretty good at handling that kind of stuff (and the Samsung Galaxy S II has plenty of RAM), but power users will enjoy it nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A number of gestures you saw in the video can be used to interact with the phone ? there?s the common turn-to-mute feature, double tap to activate voice commands in Car mode and more advanced stuff like tilt to zoom (works in Gallery and Browser) and tilt to pan (works when adding shortcuts/widgets to the homescreen or menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is quite responsive to the gestures (you can adjust the sensitivity if you want) and even when you overdo it, animations remain smooth despite things zooming past at great speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some benchmarks comparing the Exynos and Tegra 2 chipsets. They're mostly equal in terms of CPU performance. The GPU performance of the Galaxy S II is suspect, probably caused by a software cap on the framerate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, keep in mind that tested 1GHz version of the I9100 Galaxy S II. Reports of the 1.2GHz version (which should be the retail clock speed) show a 25% improvement on performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Familiar gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you ? aside from displaying full-res images and the addition of the two-finger tilt zoom, there?s nothing new really. And don?t you worry, the double tap and pinch zoom are still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but functional file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image and video editors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You also get an image editor and a video editor preinstalled. The image editor handles the basics like image rotation, cropping (no resize though) and adjusting brightness/saturation/contrast. You can also make selections (using a smart tool similar to the Quick selection tool in Photoshop). It?s not nearly as accurate as the Photoshop tool though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can apply effects too but the one feature that caught our eye was Context fill ? similar to Photoshop?s Context-aware fill tool but, again, not nearly as accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video editor lets you arrange multiple clips (or photos) and music on a timeline and create a new movie to share. There are several presets, which change the look and feel of the final cut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s pretty basic but you can trim videos, split them, change the transition between scenes, apply effects and a few other tricks to turn you into a pocket Spielberg.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is unchanged, video player absolutely rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II makes use of the standard TouchWiz music player. We guess it?s reserved for the Galaxy S lineup. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also here. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player itself supports three crop modes to select how the video fills the screen. There?s 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitles sync (move them back or forward a few seconds) but there?s no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it ? starting with .WMV, through .AVI (DivX and XviD) and .MP4 to .MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn?t a problem either ? the Samsung Galaxy S II played FullHD files. Large files of over 2GB worked as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great 8MP camera with customizable UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II comes with an 8MP auto-focus camera for photos of up to 3264 x 2448 pixel resolution. It comes with an LED flash but nothing in the way of lens protection or physical shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface looks pretty familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get several controls by default but the good news is that you can pick four shortcuts to put there ? commonly used features need to be one tap away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of features, the Samsung Galaxy S II offers pretty much everything ? touch focus, scene modes, face/blink/smile detection, effects, geotagging, image stabilization and manual controls for ISO, metering mode and so on. There are other features too, we?re just listing the most interesting ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images captured with the 8MP camera of the Galaxy S II are very good ? low noise, plenty of fine detail and the color and contrast are good too. Colors are a smidge oversaturated but that?s how we like them. Keep in mind that the camera has a wide-angle lens.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II enters the skirmish over in our Photo Compare Tool. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent FullHD video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one. You get the same customizable panel on the left for four shortcuts. The video camera can record video using the front facing camera too (resolution is limited to VGA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When shooting FullHD videos you have a narrower field of view than that of the stil camera. Perhaps Samsung apply the same trick as Apple in the iPhone 4: the camcorder uses only the center of the 8 MP sensor. In 720p video capture mode, pixel binning gives you the same field of view as the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What this means for the occasional videographer is 720p videos might turn out the better option in low light as pixel binning actually lowers the digital noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The longer focal range in 1080p mode also makes for a more shaky video so you might want to look for a support for your hand while recording to get the best out of the Samsung Galaxy S FullHD camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder features continuous autofocus, which is pretty smooth though a bit slow at times. Here?s a demo of it in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than those peculiarities, the video quality is very good at 1080p ? the .MP4 files come with 17Mbps bitrate and have a lot of detail. The framerate is very smooth too ? there are no dropped or duplicated frames. Keep in mind that FullHD videos gobble up a lot of memory ? a minute of video footage will easily top 100MB file size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos are nice and smooth too, but obviously short of the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We prepared a batch of video crops comparing the Galaxy S II to the LG Optimus 2X. The videos (both 1080p and 720p) were shot with the Galaxy S II and the LG Optimus 2X one after the other. Just keep in mind that the JPEG compression has added some extra artifacts but it should handicap both if at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s an untouched FullHD video from the Samsung Galaxy S II and two sample videos uploaded to YouTube. One is 720p and the other is 1080p (don?t forget to select 1080p when playing that second one and certainly open it fullscreeen).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A great web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser hardly has changed, the hardware specs of the Samsung Galaxy S II propel it to great heights of user experience. The large, sharp display with great colors makes reading a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports the double tap and pinch zoom along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The powerful dual-core CPU (and probably some GPU acceleration) enables the Galaxy S II browser to play 720p Flash video ? something a lot of netbooks would choke on. You can play touch-optimized Flash games without a hitch too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android has grown Hubs too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hubs are not just for Windows Phone 7 ? Samsung, at least, seems to think so. They?ve added a total of 4 Hubs to their new Android super phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we?ve seen before ? it combines you email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn) and IM accounts (Gtalk, MSN and Yahoo! Messenger) and shows all incoming messages as one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There?s filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Hub lets you browse music online (with search tools, charts, lists of new releases and so on). You can preview songs (30 seconds each) and buy individual tracks or whole albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the Readers Hub. You can subscribe to Internet newspapers, magazines or buy e-books. You can download free previews of books, which include the first few pages of the book. Extensive genre listings will help you discover new books to read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s the Game Hub, which will quickly become your go to place for finding new games. The titles are separated into Social and Premium games and there?s a news section too. There?s a try-before-you-buy option, so you can check out a game before committing your cash. The nice thing about that Hub is it includes the titles published by Gameloft, which are otherwise not available on the Android Market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Editing Office files<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II comes preinstalled with the Polaris Office, which seems to be getting rather popular with hardware manufacturers lately. And for good reason, we guess - it?s one of the most feature rich mobile editors we?ve seen. You can view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and there?s a PDF viewer to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing offers almost a full set of options ? text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables (that?s a first). If you?re editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, merge cells and so on. Even full-featured PowerPoint presentations are doable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do practically anything with the app ? it?s better than the other mobile editors we?ve tested, even better than the Windows Phone 7 one (which had many editing limitations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app doubles as a file manager and also integrates with Google Docs and Box.net.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kies Air ? PC Suite through the web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II comes with Kies Air preloaded. The app connects the local Wi-Fi network (or it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot) and gives you an URL to type into your computer?s web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From there you can manage just about anything on the phone ? from contacts, messages (including composing messages), to browsing images, videos and other files straight in your desktop browser. You can grant or reject access to computers and see who?s connected to the phone at any one moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s really cool that you can stream music with handy playback controls. It works for videos too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: You?ll need a reasonably modern browser with Java and some video plug-in (QuickTime worked for us). </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II impressed us at every turn. We were surprised at how much engineers have managed to cram into something that?s just 8.5mm thin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new SuperAMOLED Plus display is amazing even if it makes the phone quite a big thing to hold. The camera scored big points as did the overall performance of the phone ? and that?s with the 1GHz version we tested. Samsung is yet to churn out those samples clocked at 1.2GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As flagships go, the Samsun Galaxy S II is a prime example. At times we wished for some metal on the body but that would have increased the weight ? at 116g the phone is lighter than much smaller handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re not sure about the price at which the Galaxy S II will go (pre-orders currently hover around 550 euro), but its predecessor?s price gradually settled at very reasonable levels. If the same happens to this Galaxy, it might be the smartphone to buy this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have yet more tests to perform and aspects of the Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II to explore, but those will wait until the full review. Our first impressions are nothing but positive and that?s quite a way to start.</paragraph>
