		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG's first 1080p droid is also the company's first smartphone to cross the 5" mark, but a massive screen isn't the only thing that warrants the Pro tag. The LG Optimus G Pro boasts a new chipset too, and a significant software update over the Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet duties are taken seriously - the screen offers 20% more real estate than a full-HD 5 incher, without dropping below 400ppi. The Optimus G Pro also improves on multi-tasking with the updated Snapdragon 600 chipset and revamped QSlide multi-tasking that works a lot better than the version we saw on the Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro is quite the entertainer too - it can be the device that ties together your whole multimedia setup at home. It has multiple ways to stream multimedia (both wired and wireless) and thanks to Dual Screen Dual Play, the phablet's display is independent of the TV display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's not done when you press play either, with its IR emitter and QRemote app the G Pro can control your TV and stereo, but also a projector and even an air con.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has put a 13MP main camera on the Optimus G Pro, same as the regular G, and bumped up the front-facer to 2.1MP / 1080p. This may seem as a minor upgrade, but it's made cooler by the Dual recording feature - it uses both cameras to capture both the photographer and the subject. The still camera grew a couple of new features too, Intelligent Auto and VR Panoramas (which are basically Photo Spheres).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet has a 3,140mAh battery, about what you'd expect from a device this size. But it also comes with a spare battery with its own charging dock, which also serves as a stand for the handset (no need to swap batteries to have them both charged, but no simultaneous charging either). That's great news anyway for heavy users who run their battery flat in under a day. The G Pro supports wireless charging out of the box too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro has the specs to appeal to both business users and tech enthusiasts, but those two groups are quite picky about the hardware - it just has to be top notch. So, can the flagship LG phablet deliver? Head over to the next page where we begin to find out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-stuffed box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro came in a well-stuffed box. The charger is slightly bulkier than usual (still compact enough to carry around) but an output of 1.8A makes all the right difference compared to the 1A of smaller chargers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The box we got the G Pro in also packed a spare battery unit and the supplied stand has a slot at the back to accommodate it. You cannot charge both batteries simultaneously with the stand though - you will have to use another charger for the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty standard: a microUSB cable for computer connectivity and charging (the stand has a microUSB port too) and a QuadBeat headset. The headset is an in-ear design with flat cabling and a remote. The remote has an answer button, along with volume controls. There are two extra ear tip sets included.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro measures 150.2 x 76.1 x 9.4mm - nearly 2cm taller and a centimeter wider than the Optimus G, though the bigger screen accounts for most of that extra size. The G Pro is narrower and slightly shorter than a Samsung Galaxy Note II, however, which means LG has made better use of the available space than Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pro weighs 160g, which is only 15g more than the non-Pro version and 23g lighter than the Note II. Overall, LG has done well to keep size and weight in check despite the large screen and massive battery (which weighs 56g itself).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro takes some design cues from the Optimus G but does well to set itself apart. It's smoother with rounder corners, beveled screen glass, more curvature around the back and even the camera which sits on a smoothly beveled bump rather than a small square.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another important difference is that the front of the white G Pro is actually white, unlike the regular G whose front was black regardless of the body paintjob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build of the Optimus G Pro is dominated by glass - both the front and the back - though LG hasn't disclosed the exact details of the finish. Still the phablet manages a premium, quality feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is obviously a major feature and we'll talk about its image quality in the next chapter. The glass above the display is curved, which is good, though the plastic edge that runs around the sides of the phablet is raised and spoils the feel a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen bezel looks razor thin, though LG does cheat a bit here - if you look at the G Pro, at first you'd think that the white border is the bezel of the screen, but the actual bezel also includes a black border that's easier to see when the screen is on. That said, the bezel isn't thick by any means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, above the display we find the usual setup - a centrally located earpiece, a proximity sensor and the secondary 2.1MP camera right next to it. The LG Optimus G Pro supports dual-video recording, which means you are able to capture video with both cameras simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display, a hardware Home button is surrounded by capacitive Back and Menu keys. The home key is rather thin and almost flush against the surface, it's not the most comfortable button to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a status LED below the Home key. It is highly customizable and lights up in different colors depending on the notification - incoming or missed calls, alarms, calendar reminders, apps, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side the Optimus G Pro features a customizable Q-Slide key and the single-piece volume rocker below it. Those keys used to be combined in the Optimus G, but we like this solution better as it rules out accidental presses of the volume controls. The volume rocker is noticeably more raised than the Q-Slide key, which helps touch orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side is the lonely Power/Lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the G Pro has an IR emitter for the remote control functionality and right next to it is the 3.5mm audio jack. The Slimport-enabled microUSB port is at the bottom. There are two mics on the phablet - one at the bottom, which serves as a mouthpiece, and one at the top, for noise-cancellation during calls and stereo audio capture during video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is made entirely of glossy plastics, but it is nicely textured and reminds us of the Nexus 4 back. The pattern uses squares instead of dots, but they still "move" as you tilt the phone. The metallic LG and LTE logos are engraved on the plastic, so you can actually touch them, unlike the logos on the Optimus G, which were hidden under the glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the back of the LG Optimus G Pro also features the 13MP camera lens, centrally placed at the top. The LED flash and loudspeaker grille are on both sides of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A peek under the battery cover reveals the microSIM card slot (it's obstructed by the battery so you can't hot swap it), the hot-swappable microSD card slot and the 3,140mAh battery itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our usual battery tests on the LG Optimus G Pro and rated its endurance at 50 hours. The 3G talk time was pretty impressive - 20 hours and 45 minutes - but the web browsing time was not - 6 hours and 40 minutes. The G Pro ended on a positive note with a respectable video playback time of 8 hours and 40 minutes. You can read more details about the Optimus G Pro battery life over at our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG is selling Quick Covers for the G Pro - a flip cover that automatically switches the screen on and off as you open and close it. Those covers have a hole cut out to let you see the LED notifications around the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro is a solidly built phablet with a practical design. It has good looks, though it's not terribly original (it looks a bit like the Note II to be honest). Holding the phablet in the hand and pocketing isn't a problem, though unless you have big hands you'll have issues reaching the four corners of the screen with your thumb. At least until you find the right hand hold the Optimus G Pro (you have to hold it higher than you would a smaller handset, it takes some getting used to).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The eye-catching 5.5" True HD IPS Plus display of Full HD resolution is definitely one of the LG Optimus G Pro's key selling points. LG is keen on making lots of noise about how the colors are rendered, pitting it against Samsung's AMOLED displays. Long story short, LG claims the Optimus G Pro's display shows 100% accurate colors, unlike AMOLED screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what the screen looks like through the eyes of our digital microscope:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, we took it for a test drive ourselves and we can safely confirm that the images indeed look great and colors pop, especially the reds. The display is impressively sharp too, thanks to the amazing pixel density of 400 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the screen junkies that we are, we decided to take out the Galaxy S III and put its Super AMOLED 720p screen next to the True HD-IPS+ 1080p LCD of the G Pro. The S III has better contrast and oversaturated colors (which is plus or a minus, depending on who you ask).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro's screen is more reflective and there is contrast loss when you're looking at the screen at an angle. It's a minor thing though, the G Pro screen is excellent overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also compared the Optimus G Pro to the regular Optimus G. The smaller phone has a screen of 318ppi and, while you can't quite see individual pixels, you can still notice jaggies on curves and diagonals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro's screen has about the same contrast though it's brighter. It has a noticeable advantage in viewing angles, the Optimus G screen starts showing a shift in contrast earlier and the effect is much stronger. The Optimus G Pro screen is a bit more reflective though and it's sunlight legibility is worse.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The capacitive sensor on the screen is very sensitive and will detect touches even if you're wearing gloves, using a long fingernail or an improvised stylus (like keys, some pens, etc.). Unfortunately, there was also a fair number of accidental taps as the screen is a bit too receptive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note something we ran across during benchmarking the Optimus G Pro. After an intensive benchmark the screen refused to go over 92% brightness due to "temperature restrictions". The back of the device was warm, but not unpleasantly hot. It cooled off pretty quickly and the screen went back to full brightness, but it's something to keep in mind when running intensive games.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Jelly Bean meets Optimus UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro is the first LG smartphone to be powered by Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean with the company's own Optimus UI topping out of box. The customizations run deep and there's a rich selection of themes, changeable icons and home-brewed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the LG Optimus G Pro on video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jelly Bean brings quite a lot of goodies, but the custom launcher has only seen a few major changes over its ICS version. Google Now is on board, and Project Butter is doing its magic in the background, but that's mostly it. The overall user experience is still very similar to the one on the Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool LG lockscreen is virtually unchanged since the original Optimus G. Swiping from any spot on the lockscreen creates a magnifying glass effect, allowing a peek of what's underneath as if you're looking through a rain drop. You can also place up to five shortcuts that will unlock the phone straight into an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the lockscreen clock style too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the homescreen fits up to 7 shortcuts (including the shortcut to the App Drawer) and that's two more than what TouchWiz offers on the Samsung Galaxy S III. You don't have to use all available slots though - you can discard all but the App Drawer shortcut if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the shortcuts are visible on any of the homescreen panes. With the exception of the app drawer shortcut, you can rearrange, delete or replace any of these with shortcuts of your choosing, even folders. In fact, most aspects of the phone's behavior can be customized, you can go to as small detail as the capacitive key backlight and the transition effect between homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG home-baked tweaks and enhancements are by no means limited to the visuals. The Q Slide option makes it possible for you to watch a video while using other apps, while the system-wide QuickMemo integration allows you to take a screenshot anywhere in the phone and take notes over it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can resize widgets or you can even shrink a widget down to the corresponding app's icon. Also if you move a widget over an occupied slot on the homescreen, the icons underneath immediately move out of the way, which is really neat and comes as part of Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done by tapping and holding on a blank area of a homescreen. A context menu appears, allowing you to add various customizations to your phone. The tabs along the bottom let you select the appropriate app, widget or wallpaper, which you can add to the homescreen of your choice. Gridlines will appear when you hold and drag an app or widget, allowing you to easily place it on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a set of different icons to choose from and you can even make custom ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contextual menu gives you a quick access to different settings, as well as themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has also enabled plenty of other customization options for the homescreen . There's a dedicated setting for looped homescreen scrolling and the so-called screen effect changes the transition effect between homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has also been tweaked by LG to let you rearrange the toggle buttons available. You are also free to add and remove toggles from the edit menu. You can add an insane amount of shortcuts here, and don't have to worry about whether they'll fit on the screen - the row becomes side-scrollable so you can still access them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, if you have a music track playing in the background, quick controls will show up here. You can also swipe notifications to the left or right to dismiss them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default you get seven homescreen panes to fill up with widgets and shortcuts, but you are free to delete any that you don't need to speed up navigation. You can also set any of the homescreens as default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher hasn't changed a whole lot since ICS. It shows you all of the currently running apps, which can be swiped left or right to terminate. The task switcher is accessed by holding down on the hardware home button. There, you'll also find a shortcut to Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, there are number of icons at the bottom, which let you quickly open up a particular app or even stop all apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a shortcut to the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's task manager lists the currently running apps, but also lets you uninstall apps and gives you info on your storage. It comes with its own dedicated widget, which shows a graph of the available RAM and conveniently offers a button to clear up memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer lists all your available apps and widgets, with a dedicated tab for user downloads. There is a button in the top right corner, which triggers edit mode and lets you to easily reshuffle or uninstall applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to make the icons in the app drawer smaller too. If you select an app whilst in edit mode, a pop up will let you see information like RAM usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG borrowed a trick from Samsung's TouchWiz and implemented its own version of Samsung's Smart Stay - called Wise screen. It uses the front-facing camera to detect whether you're looking at the screen. This means you can browse the phone for hours on end without it auto-locking itself. We can confirm that the feature works very well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now shows what virtual assistants should be like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now was first introduced in Jelly Bean 4.1 and is definitely one of the most interesting additions to the OS. Simply put, it's Google's version of a personal assistant. Google Now is in the same neck of the woods as Apple's Siri, but it learns constantly from your use patterns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's accessed by swiping up on any of the on-screen controls and gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work the same route every morning? Google Now will let you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office and will offer an alternative route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you with score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google constantly updates Google Now and in its latest version has become even smarter. If you allow it, the service can scan your email for upcoming flights, deliveries or restaurant reservations and let you know when they are due. There are also numerous kinds of cards like birthdays (yours and those of your contacts and friends in the Google+ social network) and what distance you've walked in a particular month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made things faster as it's not dependent on the speed of your data connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in regards to accuracy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro boasts a Snapdragon 600 chipset with four Krait 300 cores clocked at 1.7GHz, 2GB of RAM and the Adreno 320 GPU. With specs like that you would expect the phablet to be a real benchmark champion and luckily it delivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro managed to top the Benchmark Pi and Linpack tests, which are meant to judge single and multi-core performance respectively.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.5" LG flagship had excellent performance in the two compound benchmarks we run, too. At Antutu it didn't quite manage to come on top, but it still posted a great score of over 20,000 points, while Quadrant saw the LG Optimus G Pro score another victory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran GLBenchmark off-screen, which means we're testing at a fixed resolution, which lets us test the raw GPU power. The Optimus G Pro didn't disappoint, but failed to beat the HTC One. Still, it scored as much as the less powerful Xperia Z, and a tad better than the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But most games will probably want to run at native resolution, so we're including Epic Citadel, which uses Unreal Engine 3. Unreal Engine is popular with mobile game makers, so it's a pretty important test. The benchmark was run at the High Quality setting and yet the Optimus G Pro posted a great result and is breathing in the Xperia Z's neck pushing the 60fps limitation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider is all about pure JavaScript performance. Here, the Optimus G Pro only got a mid-table finish, but the truth is the difference is hard to perceive in real-life scenarios.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Snapdragon 600 platform proved itself to be an excellent choice for the full HD Optimus G Pro, turning it into an excellent performer. UI navigation is fluid and smooth with apps launching more than swifly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Good-looking phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Optimus G Pro is pretty much the standard Jelly Bean affair with Optimus UI goodies sprinkled on top. It has a tabbed interface, in which the central tab lists all contacts alphabetically. You can navigate the tabs by swipes or, alternatively, touch the specific tab labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact images, where available, are displayed and there's a quick alphabet scroll on the right. There's also a regular search bar on top of the contacts list. The other tabs are Groups and Favorites on the right and Dial and Call logs on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phonebook from getting messy - you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, Twitter contacts and so on). The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed - First Name, Last Name or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the usual Android fashion, a tap on a contact photo brings up the quick contacts shortcuts. You can call the contact, send text or email or view their profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the name of a single contact brings up their details. Once you're there, you can edit the contact info by hitting the pencil icon in the upper right corner, while the star icon in the upper right will add them to favorites. Editing a contact is pretty straightforward; you can add or remove fields as needed, as well as specify the types of phone numbers, email addresses, ringtones, additional fields and even add notes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro had no trouble holding on to signal (even where signal was poor) and the in-call audio is consistently good and decently loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer is basically a part of the Contacts app and integrates the Call log, Contacts and Favorites, each within its own tab. Again, these tabs are side-swipeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is clever and groups some of the calls, e.g. 3 missed calls from the same contact on the same day. A number next to the contact name shows the number of events. It's a great space saving feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works for both numbers and names. Only one matching contact is displayed, but if you tap the down arrow button, the rest show up as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can pop-up the dialer should you need to dial another number. Also you can use the phone while on a call, just hit the menu key and a small green line replaces the notification area and acts like a shortcut back to the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the LG Optimus G, to find out that it has a very potent speaker. It scored an excellent mark and will undoubtedly be heard loud and clear in most situations. Aside from that sound was very clear and not just volume-happy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro can handle all common message types: SMS, MMS and email. Email capability is excellent with support for Exchange available out of box, and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of SNS integration as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia to a message is pretty straightforward - just hit the attach button next to the text field and select a number of available options, such as images, videos, voice recording, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted, spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts, and operates in much the same fashion as the Gmail one. If you add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy, although there's no conversation-style view like in Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY, Swype, voice and handwriting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro offers a standard QWERTY keyboard, which features both portrait and landscape typing. The keyboard fills up the screen nicely and offers great ergonomics with ample spacing between keys, still leaving enough room above the keyboard for you to see what you're actually typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of speed and accuracy are commendable in both portrait and landscape. There's a dedicated setting that enables keypress vibrations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Swype-like (LG dubbed it Path keyboard) input as well, though it's somewhat uncomfortably out of sight in the Input Language submenu. You need to enable Shape Writer instead of the standard QWERTY layout in the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input is enabled too, as well as handwriting. Furthermore, since this is a Jelly Bean device there's also support for offline voice typing, as long as you have preinstalled the required language packages. We are really pleased with its speed and accuracy, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.5" display allows plenty of space for cool keyboard features. One of them is the Split keyboard option from the settings menu. It's pretty easy to enable - just pinch to zoom out on the keyboard in landscape mode. There's also an extend keyboard option as well as one hand writing. The latter is invoked by flicking the portrait keyboard sideways, to resize it for comfortable one-hand input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, having the Path keyboard option on will conflict with (and effectively disable) the Split and One Hand keyboard options.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro uses the same gallery app as the Optimus G - in effect, a near stock Adroid gallery with a few custom touches here and there. It automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored on the phone. By default, images are sorted by albums, but you can sort by location or time as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different sets are tiled neatly across the screen. You can expand or shrink individual albums using a pinch to zoom gesture, making the elements of the grid of photos either really huge or very tiny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once selected, you can view an image close up by pinch zooming or double tapping on the desired area. There is a sliding gallery along the bottom which allows you to quickly browse other images in the album. On the top there are three shortcuts for quickly sharing, editing or deleting the selected photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share feature offers quick sharing via Email, Google+, Picasa, Memo, MMS, SmartShare, Social+ or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app displays images in full resolution. Zooming and panning involves no lag whatsoever on the Optimus G Pro.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the LG Optimus G Pro also looks much like the one inside the Optimus G. The interface is simple, easy to use, but still offers a lot functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip songs back and forth. The interface now has a metallic look to it instead of the dark grey theme of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a search menu, if you need to look up the title, artist or the album. After that you can pick where to search - your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search. Flipping the device to landscape mode while on the Now playing screen squeezes in a list of other songs by the same artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets, which become available when you plug in a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're playing a song it also gets displayed in the notification area, where you can pause and change tracks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Powerful video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Optimus G Pro has a fairly simple interface, giving you just a grid of all the videos on the device. There's an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can, of course, play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization. For each video you've started, the thumbnail gets a tiny clock icon, which shows how far into the video you are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated, yet it's quite powerful. The live preview feature is back - it's a YouTube-like pop up preview of the video above the scrubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get the basics out of the way, the available controls during playback include a scrubber for jumping to various parts of the video along with the standard play/pause and skip buttons. There's a pop-out button at the bottom right corner too, indicating that the app is part of the QSlide functionality on the Optimus UI. LG have implemented MX Player-like controls too - a swipe left or right will move the video forward or backwards, while a swipe up or down will tweak brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new additions is a Video Speed control (you can set values from 0.5x up to 2x). There's a lock button too, which hides all controls for pure full-screen viewing. Another cool feature in the video player is Live Zooming. You can zoom in (with the familiar pinch gesture) during playback and some serious magnification is allowed, not just a quick resize or fit to screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro handled everything we threw at it - DivX, XviD, MKV and MP4/MOV up to, and including, 1080p resolution. The AC3 audio codec (among lots of others) is supported, so you don't have to worry about the sound. There are were no issues with higher bitrates and file sizes, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG took Samsung's pop-up play feature a whole lot further with QSlide. In the latest Optimus UI iteration, LG has added a new batch of apps that take advantage of the functionality. Those include the web browser, Memo, QVoice, Calendar and Calculator. Furthermore, you can launch any of them from the notification drawer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output quiet but clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro showed nicely clean output in both parts of our traditional audio quality test. The phablet got very good scores all over the field in the active external amplifier trial, but its volume levels were below average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's very little degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones, too. The stereo crosstalk worsens a bit but the rest of the readings are virtually unaffected. Unfortunately, the volume levels are pretty low once again, but it still remains a pretty solid performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13 megapixel camera with HDR stills and video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main camera on the LG Optimus G Pro has a 13MP sensor that captures photos with a maximum resolution of 4208 x 3120 and 1080p videos at 30fps. There's also a 2.1MP front-facing camera that, too, shoots 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface has been remodeled from the Optimus G, but retains a similar controls layout. You get a bar on the right with the still/video toggle, a virtual shutter key and gallery shortcut on the right and a column with five shortcuts on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can edit the top four of these shortcuts so you can have one-tap access to the features you use most. By default, the top shortcut toggles between the front and back cameras, the second activates the "cheese shutter" (which lets you snap a photo by saying "Cheese!", "LG" or a few other words), the Time catch shot (we'll get to it in a moment), shooting mode and the settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick between one of four shooting modes - Normal, HDR, Panorama and Continuous shot. There's also the Intelligent Auto mode, which automatically selects the right scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Time catch shot feature (also called Time machine camera) snaps a photo, but also records several photos of what happened before you hit the shutter key. You can save any of the photos on that list that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a new feature called VR Panorama, basically another name for Photo Spheres. You snap one central photo and then move the phone around to fill out as much of the sphere as you want, blue rectangles appear to guide you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the photos shot with the LG Optimus G Pro is very good. There is noise, which eats into the fine detail, and sharpening, which strengthens the noise. Still, the amount of fine detail left is good and colors are reasonably accurate, though slightly oversaturated. Shadows tend to get underexposed though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If your scene has is mostly in the shadow, you might want to try HDR mode. It brings out detail in darker areas of the image (with mixed results) though it sacrifices highlights, which is something to watch out for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution photos used to make the crop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also shot a couple of photos with the Optimus G to see how the G Pro compares. The image quality seems almost the same though the cameras are not identical. The Optimus G Pro preferred short exposure at ISO 50, while the Optimus G stuck to ISO 100 and longer exposure. The G Pro photos are slightly darker and with a colder white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the photos used for this crop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And a VR Panorama sample:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera with dual recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface on the video camera is basically the same as on the still camera, except you don't get Intelligent Auto mode here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro can record 1080p videos at 30fps with either camera. Or both - that's the new Dual recording mode. It looks a lot like video calling with the video feed from one camera filling the screen and the other shown in a small window. You can tap the viewfinder to swap the cameras, even during video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live effects can be applied in real-time (that is, ones that are visible in the viewfinder as you shoot the video, not ones applied during post-processing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either use funny face effects (with automatic face detection) or do a sort-of green-screen effect by replacing the static background of the video with something more exciting (this works best with a tripod as shaking the camera causes the whole image to change).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 files with a bitrate of 17Mbps for 1080p@30fps mode. Audio is recorded in stereo at 156Kbps and a sampling rate of 38kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are good specs on paper but the actual results aren't that impressive. The videos are smooth at 30fps but the level of fine detail is lower than the best 1080p shooters, the sharpening is strong, the dynamic range is on the low side and the colors are off. The continuous autofocus and the automatic exposure are both hair triggers and go off way too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this FullHD video sample from the Optimus G Pro. You can also download this sample straight from the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, the Optimus G Pro features HDR video recording as well. It does improve the dynamic range but we'd recommend against it - the contrast of the videos is nearly ruined, and it smears out the fine detail too, while enhancing the noise and messing up the colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the video used to make this crop.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full range of connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro comes with a wide range of connectivity options. It has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for global roaming, dual-band 3G with HSPA and 4G LTE for fast mobile Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is plenty fast with dual-band Wi-Fi a/ac/b/g/n. The Wi-Fi capabilities also include Miracast wireless display, DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and Hotspot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartShare is an app that lets you control a DLNA network - you can play media from other devices (e.g. NAS) on your phone or play something from the phone onto another device (e.g. a DLNA-enabled TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi Direct is a technology, which lets devices connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty of it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to the eventual demise of Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board in the form of a dedicated app called LG Tag+. From there you can create, read and send NFC tags. With NFC you can share contacts, URLs, memos, messages, calendar events or even a call request to another NFC-enabled device or a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also store information, a profile preset or some action in a blank tag and then use it to make the phone perform an action every time you touch that tag - for instance launch a SatNav app when you touch the in-car tag or change your ringing profile when you touch your designated tag at the office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Slimport-enabled USB port on the LG Optimus G Pro can be used as a wired TV out. You'll need a dongle (sold separately). The Dual Screen Dual Play feature lets the TV screen and G Pro screen display different things, so you can check Facebook while streaming a movie to the TV or hook up a projector to the Slimport to show presentation slides while reading your notes on the phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB port has yet another feature - it enables USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (again, there isn't one in the box).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro has several ways to push out multimedia but it can do more than that - the IR emitter and QRemote app allow it to control your whole multimedia setup, the TV or a projector, the stereo, disc players and set-top boxes and even the air conditioner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple devices to QRemote and organize them by room so it can easily handle your home theater setup, the TVs in all the rooms at home, as well as the office projector and AC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is accessible from the lockscreen by tapping the Home key, which saves you a click when you want to use the G Pro as a remote. There's no QSlide version of the remote, but you can add it to the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG Optimus G Pro can replace multiple remotes and media players (Android has apps for practically all the popular movie and TV show streaming services and the Play Store is one of them to begin with).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remote can be configured to launch automatically when the G Pro connects to your home Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity option worth noting is the 3.5mm audio jack on top of the Optimus G.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro features the standard Android browser (with some LG modifications on top), but also comes with Chrome preinstalled so you are given a choice right from the start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard browser offers the typical minimalist interface, with the address bar (used both for typing web addresses and initiating web searches) on top and a control bar at the bottom (with options hidden by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling down moves the address bar out of view. The bottom control bar houses the back and forward keys, homepage shortcut as well as new window and bookmarks keys. You can hide that bar by dragging it down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One change in the Pro browser is the button just to the left of the address bar - it puts the browser into QSlide mode, turning it into a floating mini app. You can't switch between tabs in this mode, but the control bar at the bottom is still available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. A more minimalist UI is available from the Labs entry of your settings page. It hides most of the browser's user interface and gives you a quick five-button panel when you slide your finger inwards from the side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser can save pages for offline reading: they go in the Saved section of your bookmarks, and can be accessed even when you're no longer connected to the internet. The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a history section in addition to the Saved pages list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find on page, always request desktop site and share page options are available from the advanced menu. If you tap and hold on some text you get the usual markers and select/copy/find/web search/share options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro supports double tap and pinch zoom. There's text reflow too - it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you've pinched to zoom in, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text. Text remains legible even at very low zoom levels thanks to the high pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The powerful quad-core hardware enables the Optimus G browser to play 1080p Flash video without a hitch. But if Flash content is what you are after you will have to side-load the app as it's no longer available through the Play Store. We did so on our unit and everything worked trouble-free. Touch-optimized Flash plays trouble-free too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is also available on the Optimus G Pro out of the box. It doesn't support Flash or QSlide, but it will sync tabs (among other things) with the Chrome browser on your computer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro comes with the usual set of organizing apps and one of the most advanced document viewers and editors we've seen yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit mode offers almost a full set of options - text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables. If you're editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, cell merging and so on. Full-featured PowerPoint presentations can be created too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G Pro could become the essential presenter tool with SmartShare. It can stream content over HDMI (via MHL) or over Wi-Fi (Miracast) and audio over Bluetooth so you can run the presentation from your phablet. The app can also push content to compatible LG devices with Beam. Remember that with Dual Play Dual Screen you can use the phablet's screen for something else (e.g. read notes) while the TV/projector is showing the slides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has a split screen interface - the top part is reserved for the monthly calendar and one on the bottom for the agenda/daily/weekly view. This way you will always have your monthly view visible. The border line between the two sections is not fixed and you can easily move it. You can hide the monthly view completely, but you can't do the same with the other section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar supports QSlide so you can check your schedule while writing an email without having to switch between apps all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to enjoy the calendar full screen without any additional views, just turn the phone landscape. The G Pro is syncable with multiple online calendars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro features an alarm clock application, which lets you set multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time, and ringtone. You can enable application autostartup, so the calendar/email/music player/ tasks/weather app launches when the alarm goes off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a clever feature called puzzle lock, which will make you solve a simple puzzle to disable the alarm. This way you will only be able to stop the ringing when you have properly woken up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Timer, World Clock and Stopwatch features are also part of this app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a useful voice recorder and a nicely touch-optimized calculator. The calculator is QSlide enabled to be always at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app allows you to take notes and add media to them, such as images, audio, or location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notebook is more advanced and lets you create books with multiple pages, add multimedia, draw and eventually export as PDF and email them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called QuickMemo function is integrated in the phone's OS, allowing you to capture screen shots of anything (including the lockscreen!) and scribble notes over them like you would on the LG Optimus G and Vu. You can save the result as an image or add it to the Notebook app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The button can be reconfigured to launch an app instead, say QVoice, the camera or anything else you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a nice weather app that can show you the forecast by the hour, for the whole week, display the weather in the whole country and show you radar and satellite images if you're interested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a QTranslator app, which uses the camera to scan text (a word, line or block at a time) and translate it from one language to another. It's a bit slow and requires a data connection, but it can help you out if you're abroad and don't speak (or read) the language. The OCR (scanning the text) sometimes runs into trouble and produces garbage, but the translations are fairly good by automatic standards - that is to say, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro managed to get GPS lock in about a minute from cold start without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection. Initial route planning requires data to be enabled, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play app market, previously known as the Android Market, lets you download various apps for your device. Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending. New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.). You can also see if updates are available for your currently installed apps by going to My Apps in the contextual menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG SmartWorld app store is also on board. It's similar to the SamsungApps market - there you can find various content and promotions exclusive to LG users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro is the most advanced phablet on the market at the moment. It's also one of the few devices with a 1080p screen that's bigger than 5". The new Snapdragon 600 chipset is still rare enough too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The updated version of QSlide is there to make full use of the hardware - you can have up to two floating apps running alongside a full screen app, the big screen and fast quad-core Krait 300 CPU wouldn't be giving their 100% otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG did well to focus on another two important areas - multimedia connectivity and the camera. The multiple TV-Out functions and IR remote are great for any home theater but will also come in handy during a business presentation. And the camera is the only one outside the Nexus family to have the Photo Sphere-like feature. The dual-recording feature will make videos more personal too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, is there anything that can challenge the LG Optimus G Pro? Well, the Samsung Galaxy Note II has a 5.5" screen, which may be only 720p, but of the Super AMOLED variety. And the S Pen has advanced functionality that is used in multiple apps. The chipset isn't as powerful but it does have Multi-Window multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still at this point it's clear that the LG is coming to the market six months after its main rival and has had the luxury to use technology that wasn't developed when the Note II came around. So unless you really need the S Pen or you simply can't afford the Optimus G Pro, than the LG flagship is the way to go now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Padfone Infinity takes a different approach to increasing screen size - the 1080p five-incher plugs into a 10.1" 1080p tablet (which also packs an extra battery and loudspeaker). Plus, it will launch with Android 4.2 and its Snapdragon 600 chipset is clocked higher than the one in the Optimus G Pro. At &#x20ac;999 it's certainly quite expensive, though, so you will have to be really certain that you need a hybrid device like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus PadFone Infinity</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are the "regular" 5" 1080p flagships. The Sony Xperia Z and ZL brothers are the main ones in the running. The Xperia Z is only 7.9mm thick and is waterproof, while the ZL is more compact than a Galaxy S III despite the bigger screen. It has an IR emitter too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Butterfly drops the camera to 8MP and the 2,030mAh battery might not be to everyone's liking. It will be updated with Sense 5 that debuted on the HTC One, but will probably miss on the cool Zoe camera functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 is the dark horse in this race, but it turned out to have one of the best displays, while matching the performance of its rivals. Finding one of those outside China is still next to impossible, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Xperia Z &#x2022; Sony Xperia ZL &#x2022; HTC Butterfly &#x2022; Oppo Find 5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G Pro would be the favorite in a job interview - it's got a great resume and it answered all the questions correctly. We wouldn't have minded a slightly more exciting design, but it still blows the Optimus Vu out of the water.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an excellent addition to the higher echelons of the Optimus family and we have no doubt it will outsell the Vu (which did 1M sales in South Korea alone). We are sure that, aware of its own strengths, the Optimus G Pro is setting much higher goals for itself. Pressure's now on you, Samsung!</paragraph>
