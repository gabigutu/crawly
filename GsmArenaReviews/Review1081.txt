			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Three Apple tablets in a single year. This is more than anyone asked for and yet, by some weird logic - or lack thereof, not too many for Apple to successfully sell. All fine and dandy, unless you got the iPad 3 - better luck next time if you were unfortunate enough to buy it in September.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, so much for the new iPad. Number 4 is the new new iPad. You must've heard the one about the double positives. Did we hear some iPad 3 owners say "Yeah, right"? To be honest, they're not without a point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the tablet market is still Apple's to lose and the least it could do is send a message to the competition. The double November release may look like a knee-jerk reaction to Google and Microsoft's raid on the slate market but the fact is that Apple has the depth to compete on two fronts. The mini against compact droids and the iPad 4 against the Surface means Cupertino is leaving nothing to chance in defending its number one spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fourth generation iPad is no major upgrade. It keeps the design, display and the main camera of its predecessor. What it gets is a new chipset and the new Lightning port. Oh, and there's an HD FaceTime front cam but that's barely worth mentioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, it's the same tablet as the one released in March, with the class-leading Retina display and a welcome boost to the processing power. Plus, the Lightning port ensures seamless compatibility with the iPhone 5, which has sold by the millions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an Apple device so things like a file manager and a memory card slot are not even up for discussion. They'll probably never be. Nothing on the list above should come as a surprise and, if you are still with us, you are OK with most of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The A6X chipset potentially doubles the processing power but let's be honest, the real life gain is not enough to make anyone throw away a still fresh iPad 3. Yet that's what Apple just did - you can think of that as investing in the future-proofing of the device more than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPad 4 over iPad 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether or not Cupertino will admit to feeling the pressure from Microsoft, they knew the right thing to do is prepare. Apple could not afford to have development split between flagship devices running different hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Someone had to take the hit and leaving iPad 3 users out in the cold was probably a hard decision for Apple. The new product launch schedule may've put the iPad 4's market prospects in question too - users are less certain whether they should commit to a new device that may soon become outdated. Apparently, the new Apple tablets are doing great, but the iPad 4 seems to be the one that's always in stock, while the mini takes about 2 weeks to deliver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the iPad mini already had its moment in the spotlight here, it's now iPad 4's turn to have our full attention. Before we get busy, we should note that numbers are the short and easy way to set the different generations of Apple tablets apart. What was until recently known as the New iPad (iPad 3) is now discontinued. The current model (iPad 4) is officially called iPad with Retina. The only older generation Apple tablet officially in circulation is the iPad 2. Quite a mess, indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, that should be enough introduction already. Let's take a closer look at the iPad 4 hardware. Join us right after the break.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package: fourth time is not the charm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iPad packages have been more or less the same generation after generation, so the iPad 4 retail box should be no surprise to you. All you get inside is a charger and a USB Lightning cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A manual is also provided but no extra accessories such as a headset or a case.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of the fourth generation iPad, a.k.a. the iPad with Retina display, is, for the most part, a perfect clone of the iPad 3. You've probably guessed that 1% goes to the new Lightning port. The rest is the same, but we're not complaining - there's little that can go wrong with an aluminum unibody and Retina display. And yes - the large bezels prevent the big iPads from look as sharp as the mini, but there are good usability reasons for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad with Retina is the same size and weight as the iPad 3, standing at 241.2 x 185.7 x 9.4 mm and tipping the scales at 662g. The Wi-Fi only version is some 10g lighter. Compared to the iPad 2, the iPad 4 is just a tad thicker and about 50 grams heavier. But that's a negligible price to pay for much better hardware, camera and almost twice the battery backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls on the fourth generation iPad are completely identical to those on the iPad 2 and 3 - you get a Home key on the front, a power/screen lock key on top, plus a volume rocker and the screen rotation lock on the right. As usual the rotation lock can be configured to act as a mute button instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the Retina display is the FaceTime camera. It got promoted to the HD league and now uses a 1.2MP sensor capable of 720p@30fps video recording. It's not lonely though, the ambient light sensor is around to keep it company, though that one is hard to spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top, the iPad 4 has the 3.5mm jack in addition to the Power/Lock key. Thankfully, Apple didn't move the audio connector to the bottom, like they did on the latest iPhone and iPod Touch. Centrally placed at the top is the microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4's bottom is where the major difference comes in. With the new generation of tablets, Apple retired the old 30-pin connector and placed the new smaller and faster Lightning port in charge. You get a single loudspeaker right next to the connectivity port. Another point for the mini, which has stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back, the 5 megapixel camera does 1080p@30fps videos but has no flash.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The smart cover is still a handy accessory<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The smart cover for the fourth iPad is completely identical to the ones for the iPad 2 and 3. It magnetically attaches to your iPad to protect its screen and back. It is also easily converted into a stand for extra comfort when typing or watching movies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All Smart Covers currently sold by Apple and third-party manufacturers are fully compatible with the iPad 2, 3 and 4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Retina display remains intact<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Retina display, which pioneered on the third generation iPad, is of course onboard, offering four times the resolution of the iPad 2 and iPad mini at the awesome 2048 x 1536 pixels. The pixel density is far from the iPhone's 330ppi, but it's still only beaten by the Nexus 10 and its 300 ppi screen in the tablet realm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Retina display offers a lot sharper images, the pixels are barely visible even really up close and the tiniest text is perfectly readable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that some iPads come with warmer (yellowish) color scheme and some with colder (bluish). This is an issue on all iGadgets - depending on the screen manufacturer, each iPhone/iPad has a warm or cold color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vibrant colors and the great viewing angles are among the display's key assets but outdoor performance could've been quite a bit better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a snapshot of the display's matrix.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Does it heat up?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Remember the iPad 3 getting uncomfortably hot under heavy usage? We certainly do and, considering the new architecture of the iPad 4, we were curious to test it and see if it has a similar problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 was tested alongside the iPad 3, iPad 2 and the iPad mini. We started on the Epic Citadel demo - a non-Retina app, and the four devices were freshly woken up from hibernation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Epic Citadel ran for about half an hour on all four slates, after which the two Retina tablets switched to Infinity Blade II and its Retina graphics. We run the game for half an hour but took temperature measurements both halfway through the test and at the end of it. So here is the temp graph.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turned out, the new iPad 4 is a tad cooler than the iPad 3 regardless of whether you are using a heavy graphics app. In most cases the difference is between 1°C and 3°C, which is something you can actually feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, the iPad 4 can get slightly hot, especially in the bottom left corner, where the chipset is but it sure isn't intolerable, and compared to the iPad 3 it's far less prominent.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling the iPad 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you opt for an iPad, and it's your first time, you'll need some time to get used to it. We mean the full-size version of course, not the mini. Having used the iPad mini for a while, the big iPad 4 felt a bit awkward at first. However, the effort was more than worth it considering we were going back to a Retina display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The split keyboard is quite helpful (it's pointless on the mini), and given that for most of you having the iPad in your lap or using the case as a stand is the usual scenario anyway, there's little to worry about. This one is not going to become your best travel buddy as it feels more in place on your couch, but that's the case with all large tablets these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an aluminum unibody, the iPad has probably the best build quality among tablets, and in terms of styling it falls just short of the iPad mini.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>iOS 6 at the helm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iOS 6 on the Apple iPad 4 looks just like you'd expect. It's an upscaled version of the iPhone UI, with subtle changes to make better use of the available space here and there. On the plus side, the interface is very simple and very easy to pick up, though we would have appreciated some advanced functionality to go with the extra screen space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video of the iPad 4 in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad 4 lockscreen has the familiar "slide-to-unlock" slider with a shortcut alongside it to launch a slideshow of your photos without unlocking the device. Double-pressing the home button reveals music controls and a virtual volume rocker. There's no shortcut to open the camera, but given that tablets (even the smaller ones) aren't exactly the best devices for taking snaps on the go that's not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you unlock the iPad 4 you dive right in to the simplicity of iOS. Unlike Android, its interface is one consists of a single layer, which has all your apps placed in a grid. You can reorder the apps however you like or place them into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu is the one place where things get a little deeper. Most of the apps' settings are placed here instead inside the apps themselves. You can view settings for iCloud, Safari, Messages, Photos and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode, which came as a part of iOS 6 gives you further control over your notifications. If turned on, it will mute incoming calls or alerts. You can allow calls from your favorite contacts and have the option to set a specific time interval during which you won't get any notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dedicated toggle to activate the DND mode and it can be customized in the Notifications submenu. When Do Not Disturb is on, a crescent icon appears next to the clock in the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the other iOS 5+ devices, the iPad mini offers a pull-down Notification center a la Android. It looks rather awkward covering just a part of the screen, but that's how it works on Android tablets too and while we're not fans of how it looks, it doesn't cause any issues with usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access the Notification Center from anywhere in the interface and even in games or apps. It does pause the app beneath, so there's no way you accidentally stray off the road while playing Need for Speed. You can set the behavior for the notification from each individual app. The system is pretty flexible and configurable now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ideally there would have also been some connectivity toggles in the notification center, but we'll have to wait a bit longer for that we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications display on the lockscreen too and they're active. When you respond to a notification by sliding it across the screen, it will take relevant action (return a missed call) or launch the appropriate app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the iPad 4 UI feels pretty much the same as the iPad 3 and the iPad 2 before it. That is to say, it's a great combination of functionality and simplicity and Apple's continued updates to the platform have brought some excellent new functionality (and some regression with Maps). Things move faster here, but the experience on the iPad 4 isn't vastly different compared to an iOS 6-running iPad 3. In fact, we had to use one after the other and look really close to spot the differences.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 is powered by the most powerful chipset Apple has to offer at the moment, the A6X. It packs two of their custom CPU cores along with four PowerVR SGX554 GPU cores and 1GB of RAM. We've already seen that the custom CPU blows dual-core Cortex-A9s (used in the iPhone 4S, iPad 3 and mini) out of the water and the GPU is the most powerful to be put in a mobile device yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 puts the iPad 4 just behind the Samsung Galaxy S III and its quad A9s, but beats the Google Nexus 7. Oddly, the iPad 4 is also ahead of the four Krait cores in the LG Optimus G.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GLBenchmark 2.5 off-screen test shows a huge performance gap between the new GPU and the ones found in older Apple devices (and the iPad mini). The iPad 4 has a sizable lead on the new Adreno 320 used in the Optimus G too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen test renders graphics at the native resolution of the display (instead of a fixed 1080p resolution in the off-screen test). Despite having a higher screen res than the other devices used for comparison, the iPad 4 is still on top.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Browser performance is usually Apple's forte and the iPad 4 continues that trend. It aces both the JavaScript performance test and the general HTML5 performance test too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Siri reporting for duty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple's virtual assistant Siri is, of course, available on the iPad 4. Since iOS 6 Siri speaks new languages too: Canadian English and French, Spanish, Italian, the varieties of German, Italian and French spoken in Switzerland, Korean, Mandarin, Cantonese. These are also supported in the SatNav app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Support for POI search is supposed to get wider. Assistance with restaurant booking is part of Siri's new set of skills. It will find you exactly the restaurant you are looking for and filter the results based on user reviews. You can run impressively detailed searches based on food type, location, outdoor, pool, price range, ratings, etc. This feature is not available in every country, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the much-touted features is Siri's new-found flair for sports. It can answer lots of questions and isn't limited to game scores. History, stats, player bios, player comparison, teams, records, etc. Siri should be able to return most of the info right onto its own screen, without switching over to the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same applies to movies. You will get all of your movie-related answers right inside the Siri window - anything about actors, directors, awards, movie stats, premieres and tickets, reviews, trailers, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other new thing Siri can do is launch apps. Yes, it does look like one of those features that should have been there from the beginning, but better late than never, right? You can also have Siri update your Facebook and Twitter as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple announced it's working with various car manufacturers - BMW, GM, Mercedes, Land Rover, Jaguar, Audi, Toyota, Chrysler, Honda and others - to integrate Siri tightly with the car's audio systems. We are still a few years away from the moment when that collaboration bears fruit, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Facebook and Twitter integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Facebook is tightly integrated in iOS. It even goes deeper than Twitter did in iOS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already pointed out that Siri can do your status updates for you. There are dedicated shortcuts for Facebook and Twitter updates in the Notification center as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share photos on Facebook right inside the Photo app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Posting a picture on Facebook or Twitter is done through the familiar pop-up windows. For Facebook you can even customize the type of audience you wish to share the content with - close friends, family or any other group you've created.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the iPad is the same as the one on the iPhone - Contacts. It lists all of your contacts complete with multiple email, number, address and other fields. You can set different tones for each contact, work details and you have convenient send message and share contact shortcuts available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your contacts are automatically sync'd so that you instantly get them from your phone, be it an iPhone, Android, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like in Android you can sync your Facebook contacts with the phonebook. If you do, the system will search email and phone numbers, so it can link your contacts with their Facebook profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a successful Facebook link, the contact's picture, addresses, important dates, emails, phone numbers and websites will be updated. You will also get a new Facebook field with a shortcut to the contact's Facebook profile. It will load in the Safari browser however, not the dedicated Facebook app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Facebook albums and feeds do not appear in the phonebook. All Facebook events will appear in the Calendar though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the iPad mini, the iPad 4 continues the iPad tradition of having only a single loudspeaker. We performed out loudspeaker test on it and it scored a Good mark. We don't see many people using the iPad mini as a playing station but it will do for the occasional movie on the couch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more details on the testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iMessage and mail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iPad 4 comes with iMessage - it lets you exchange instant messages between iOS-running iGadgets (running iOS 5 or above) via Wi-Fi or 3G. You can send plain text as well as multimedia (pictures, sounds, videos) messages. The app stores all your messages within threads and offers options for mass delete and forwarding. There is a search field, MMS support (if you choose to attach a multimedia file) and character counter. iMessage gives you delivery reports too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 probably won't be your primary device for chatting on iMessage but it's very convenient that when you have an ongoing conversation on an iPhone you can simply continue it on your iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email supports multiple accounts (configurable in the Settings app) and offers Universal Inbox (showing all your mail at once). The Mail app also supports threads, email archiving and quick lookup of documents thanks to the integrated document viewer. There is also an Open With option, offerings to handle your files with some of your installed apps (PDF reader, mobile office, iBooks, etc).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In portrait mode the left bar with all your emails remains hidden until prompted while in landscape you get both the inbox/emails bar visible and the email you've opened is on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a VIP list, and emails from people on the list will be delivered to a dedicated VIP mailbox and will appear highlighted in your standard inbox. You can also set a different notification regime for VIP emails - so they appear on the lockscreen, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you open your Inbox and hit the Edit button, you now have a Mark key alongside Move and Delete. You can now mass mark emails as read/unread or flag them as important. Unfortunately, a "Select All" option is still missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bold, Italic and Underline font styles are added to the text editing options as well as quote font size levels. Text selection works the usual way (tap &amp; hold &amp; select) and the available options will appear as soon you've made the selection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Notes app is exactly the same as before. You get the familiar split-screen layout with the notes you've saved on the left and the note edit screen on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your notes are also synced with iCloud so you won't have to worry about losing any of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri-powered dictation is available in Notes, Email, iMessage and any app that supports it. It works just like on the iPhone 5 - hit the corresponding button your keyboard and start dictating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard on the iPad 4 is exactly the same as on the previous iPads and knows the same tricks. You can undock the keyboard, which places it dead center on the screen. You can then move it up or down, depending on what's underneath and where you would like to place it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also split the keyboard in two by doing a simple pinch gesture on it or selecting it from the keyboard options. This is pretty useful in both portrait and landscape orientations if you have to type while holding the tablet - reaching the middle of the screen with your thumbs is hard, even when you hold the iPad 4 in portrait orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smaller iPad mini offered a better typing experience as it was easier to hold and it was it was easier to reach all the keys. Still, people have been typing on 9.7" iPads for years now and if you're upgrading your fingers will be used to it. If not, give the split keyboard a try - it's a bit unusual at first but you get the hang of it pretty quickly.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos and Photo Sharing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Photos on the iPad 4 are handled by the Photos app. The large, sharp screen is excellent at showing photos. Photos come out in full resolution (no downsizing) and 4:3 aspect ratio of the screen is an advantage here as photos fit perfectly, there's no letterboxing or cropping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app on the iPad 4 is rich on eye-candy - you can pinch-zoom your way back to gallery view here and into single photo view. There is also a small thumbnail bar at the bottom for quick picture scrolling. You can select multiple pictures, delete them, copy them in other albums or share them. You can also preset a slideshow with adjustable transitions and music arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view photos by album, by picture (everything stacked in one place), view them in a slideshow sequence with the option to choose a track to go along with them. You can see the location of the photos in Map view and see faces on the photos (you'd need Aperture or iPhoto on a computer to use Faces).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 6 brings Shared Photo Stream to the iPad. It acts like a social sub-network, built right into the Photos app. You will be able to choose what pictures to share and which people to share with. Your buddies on the receiving end will be able to like them and post comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo Stream works really well and is very simple to set up. You can invite users you want to share your Photo Stream with via email or get invited.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback isn't the iPad element<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 isn't the best device to watch videos on - you need iTunes to upload content, the screen is the awkward 4:3 aspect ratio and the supported video formats are quite limited. There is not even DivX or XviD support (out of the box).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPad 4 supports playback of MOV files all the way up to 1080p resolution, but has some specific requirements for bitrate. We threw a few 1080p trailers in iTunes and only half of them made it through the sync into the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, by using a third-party player you can upload clips via the iTunes File Sharing service and upload any video file. It turned out this way we had much fewer limitations to worry about and we managed to play all MOV/MP4 files up to 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPads generally aren't the best devices for watching videos - the constrains of the ecosystem, the limited video player and the unsuitable aspect make them notably inferior to their Android rivals in that department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 lasts nearly 10 hours of playing SD videos. That's three hours less than the iPad mini, but that has a smaller screen with only a quarter of the resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iPod music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music player on the iPad 4 resembles the desktop iTunes using the split-screen interface to make best use of the large resolution screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Organizing your music library is easy and there is the option to apply equalizers. Combined with the excellent audio quality (more on that to come), that makes the iPad a promising music tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music application also has its own search in addition to the general Spotlight search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual you are mostly stuck with iTunes for uploading and downloading music content on your iPad. We hate to be forced to use a specific kind of software for uploading music tracks, but we already knew what we were signing for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use a work around for uploading your images (like Dropbox for example), but you'll have to use the basic sound player for that and that one has virtually no features whatsoever. It's unlikely that Apple would revise its policy so if you hate the iTunes dependency, then you already know to stay away from iGadgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also buy and download tracks straight off the iTunes Store on the iPad 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple users used to this way of doing things will find no problems here - if you're not opposed to using iTunes exclusively the experience is actually really handy and you can fill up on music in no time with the only required thing would be a stellar internet connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual excellent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As expected the Apple iPad 4 aced out audio output test. There are some difference between its performance and that of its predecessor, but both are bordering on perfection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad 4 has really loud output and when connected to an active external amplifier, managed get perfect readings all over the field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then, there's the equally impressive scores when you connect a pair of headphones. There's hardly any degradation, the intermodulation distortion being the only affected reading. Plus, volume levels remain at the same levels as when there were no headphones connected, which scores another point for the iPad 4. Job well done, Apple!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5 MP iSight camera goes smaller<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 features a 5 MP iSight camera capable of producing stills of 2592x1944 pixel resolution. It features Geo-tagging (Wi-Fi location on the Wi-Fi only model), touch focus and face detection. Long story short, the last two full-sized iPads are on par in the camera department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is as basic as it gets, offering very little controls outside of the virtual shutter key. Besides that, there are two toggles - one for switching between still and video modes and one for switching between front and back-facing cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an Options button too, but that hides only the grid option (it makes us wonder why Apple didn't just put a Grid button). You can activate AE/AF lock by tapping and holding on the screen but you're missing out on HDR and the panorama feature. Not that we advocate taking photos with a tablet, but Apple made a big deal out of panorama shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images captured with the iPad 4 turned out good for a 5MP shooter - there is a good amount of fine detail (though noise reduction takes some away) and colors are okay. The camera tends to overexpose bright areas, but that's nitpicking - you probably won't be doing much shooting with such a big tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4's iSight camera is capable of producing 1080p videos @ 30fps. Although not the go-to device for making home movies it's still a nice addition to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface borrows from the camera one - you get one shutter button, a switch to front-facing camera toggle and that's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have a bitrate of around 18 Mbps and a smooth 30fps framerate. Audio has a bitrate of 65 Kbps with a sampling rate of 44 kHz but it is mono, as with all iDevices so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are smooth and detail is good enough, though there is some grain visible. The videos are perfectly usable though not as good as the iPhone 5 produces (no surprise there).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 also features video stabilization. It's more of a software gimmick as it is real hardware stabilization but it does remove some of the shake, which is useful when shooting video with a tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample video uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched 1080p@30fps sample (23MB, 11s) taken straight off the device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 joins our video quality comparison tool, where you can compare its output quality to that of the other 1080p contenders we have tested. The tool's page will give you information on how to work with it and what to look for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 comes in either Wi-Fi only or Wi-Fi + Cellular options. Wi-Fi is dual-band meaning both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands work fine, covering all Wi-Fi standards - a/b/g/n.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cellular version of the iPad has two different flavors. There's a quad-band GSM/HSPA one with dual-band LTE and a CDMA version with quad-band GSM/HSPA and penta-band LTE. The cellular connectivity on the iPad 4 is used for data only, so native calls are out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also note that the Wi-Fi only version of the tablet does not have GPS connectivity, only the Wi-Fi + Cellular version does. This time, however, you also get support for GLONASS, which the iPad 3 lacked. The benefits of supporting two positioning systems are faster lock in dense urban regions and more accurate positioning in some areas of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's stereo Bluetooth 4.0, nano-SIM support (for the cellular units) and the lightning connector, which corresponds to USB 2.0 with some MHL-like features. With the appropriate adaptor, you can get 1080p TV-Out or USB mass storage/SD card connectivity (which is very limited as you can only transfer photos and nothing else).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Safari browser does a solid job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides photo viewing, web browsing is the other area where the 4:3 aspect ration of the iPad 4 screen shines. Unlike widescreen tablets, holding the tablet in landscape gives you plenty of vertical room to work with and the Retina display keeps text sharp and readable even at low zoom levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multiple tabs support and the auto fill and password managers improve the usability of the Safari browser greatly. The pop-up menus appear as small windows on the screen itself rather than occupying the display things are even more desktop-like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can share pages directly from the share menu in Safari. Sharing options include Mail, iMessage, Twitter and Facebook. Reading list allows you to save pages for offline reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reader mode is a great way of reading longer articles in Safari. It strips the web content of fancy fonts and ads and presents you the essential stuff that's really easy on the eye. It works alright on most pages but you won't find it available as an option on all pages. For those cases there are always other options - like Evernote Clearly and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 is noticeably better at browsing desktop sites than its mini sibling - the bigger and sharper screen allow you to read a page without zooming, while you have to zoom and pan on the mini. On the downside, it's heavier so you'll probably want to rest it on a table for extended reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 10 hours and 20 minutes, the iPad 4 is the new web browsing champ in our battery tests, beating the former champ, the iPhone 5. In this test the iPad 4 is ahead of the iPad mini too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple Maps on a tablet screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 comes with Apple's new mapping service along with voice-guided navigation, courtesy of Siri, faster vector graphics, a cool 3D Flyover mode but and a long list of missing or otherwise not very functional shortcomings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app works much better on the iPad 4 than on the iPhone 5, as it allows much more content to fit on the screen. It's especially better for browsing cities and enjoying Flyover mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation will work even on the lockscreen or in the background. Real-time traffic reports are available and Apple is also sourcing the live traffic info anonymously from iOS users on the road in association with Waze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned there's a catch here - the Wi-Fi only version of the iPad 4 doesn't have a built-in GPS, it uses Wi-Fi positing, so navigation is out of the question. Not a huge problem as there are very few people who'd use a 9.7" tablet for navigation, but Apple skimping on the GPS/GLONASS receiver is disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D Flyover mode is a great bonus for your viewing pleasure. When you enable the 3D view (outside navigation) you will be able to explore cityscapes from birds-eye view. The currently available selection is extremely limited, but hopefully more areas will be added later on. You can zoom, tilt and rotate using two-finger gestures to explore 3D landmarks rendered in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While rich on eye-candy, Apple's Maps are still behind the curve in terms of functionality. Its shortcomings have been well documented - the 3D graphics aren't the most accurate around and the neither is the map data itself. There are other things missing, like no street view and no public transport route planning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While planning a route, there is a bus icon, but that just searches the App Store for apps that can navigate you through the public transport network. Also, as you might remember even Tim Cook himself suggested you try the competitors' products until they improve.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>App and iTunes stores<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple App Store is the great looking app repository that offers the largest collection of tablet-optimized apps on the market right now. As of iOS 6 it has a slightly different manner of operation. Firstly, you won't be prompted to enter your password when you just update apps. Secondly, you can see the change log in the Updates screen without actually opening the info screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's now an All Categories toggle in the top left corner. The Categories tab at the bottom has been replaced with Genius, which lists apps you might like on the basis of the apps you've already seen or downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, after you buy or update apps you will no longer be kicked back to the homescreen - you can continue browsing the store. You can launch apps you've already installed from within the store too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iTunes Store also features the new interface, which is way cleaner with a more images. Facebook reviews are available here too so you can check out what people are saying about an album, movie, etc. You can also preview just about everything. Ringtones, alert tones, movies, etc. can all be checked out or listened to before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music syncing is probably the trickiest part of the iCloud sync. Along with the tracks purchased from the iTunes store you surely have a collection of your own that you sync with your iOS device via iTunes. Well, Apple is now offering a service to sync both collections in one place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo Booth and FaceTime<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photo Booth is almost the same as the Mac OS X Photo Booth - you can use the front or the rear camera to take funny pictures of yourself or a friend. There are only 8 different filters here, but the results are pretty funny nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app has very simple interface - you have nine squares where you can see the different filters applied in real time. You choose a filter and tap on it. Now you can take a picture, change the camera or review/delete your previous Photo Booth photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 has a 1.2 MP front-facing camera, which is capable of 720p FaceTime video calls. FaceTime works over Wi-Fi and a cellular connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is pretty minimal, you get the opposite's video feed, a mute, end and switch camera toggles and a small window of your own video feed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps on the iPad 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Calendar on the iPad uses the screen estate very well giving you split-screen interface - the date on one side and the agenda view on the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view your events and tasks by day, week, month, year or as a list. You can also opt to view appointments from your iCloud, Exchange, Google, Yahoo, etc. or all of them at the same time. There's a handy option to view Birthdays too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which calendars you want to see - Facebook, iCloud, Exchange, etc. Your iCloud calendar can be divided into many categories like personal, work, birthdays or you can choose to have multiple calendars for different people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating an event hasn't changed. You have the usual array of options - you can choose a date or dates, hours, to set an alarm, to add invites, location, etc. Finally you can choose to which calendar you want to save the event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The separate Reminders app has a simple interface but it does a nice job. You can set to be reminded on a day or at a location (you'll need a GSP-enabled iPad).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a reminder sets off, you see it as a standard notification - on your lockscreen, the Notification Center and the homescreen (as a banner or a pop-up).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app on the iPad mini is the usual affair. You can add multiple alarms (though we don't see many people using an iPad as an alarm clock) and they get displayed in a nice time-table grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 also comes with Stopwatch and Timer, built into the Clock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iBooks really comes into its own on the 9.7" screen of the iPad 4. The screen comfortably fits a lot of text and with the high pixel density, text is rendered flawlessly. Also, if you're a fan of graphic novels you'll really appreciate the extra room and sharpness that the iPad 4 offers over the iPad mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 LCD is no E-Ink though and will eventually hurt your eyes if you spend too long time with it. And the tablet is too heavy to hold like you would an eReader or even the iPad mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, aside from iBooks you can also open PDFs. You can choose different fonts, reduce and increase the text size, change the background and play around with brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipboard is a great app for enjoying the web through a magazine-styled layout and it really shines on the Retina display. Scrolling through apps is smooth and pictures look good, even at this resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad 4 and its Apple-designed chipset feature the most powerful GPU to be put in a mobile device - by quite a margin! Games can take advantage of the full resolution of the tablet (a lot of games on the iPad 3 would render at a lower resolution and then upscale the image to fit the screen). Of course, some games might need to be updated to be able to squeeze the extra juice from the PowerVR SGX554MP4 GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gaming on the iPad 4 is a very good experience, though having tried the mini we think we prefer the smaller tablet - things were easier to reach there and the at half the weight of the big tablet, the iPad mini is much better at accelerometer/gyroscope based games.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad was not the first tablet but it can claim sole responsibility for the explosive growth of the tablet market. Then the iPad 2 came to drastically cut the weight and double the processing power, and the iPad 3 crowned the collection with the gorgeous Retina display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With these jumps between generations in mind, the iPad 4 feels more like a 3S. That's not entirely fair though - the new chipset offers a greatly enhanced performance. And while it looks like the exact same tablet on the outside, the Lightning connector allows the tablet to share accessories with the iPhone 5. Millions of people have upgraded to the new iPhone and not having to keep double stock of accessories is more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the hardware of the iPad 4 is concerned, it's one of the best 10" tablets available. It's the software that we have a bigger issue with - iOS 6 has many fine enhancements, but Android and Windows 8 RT feel like they're starting to pull ahead. Android in particular has been eroding the iPad's tablet dominance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, that's it then - the iPad 3 is discontinued in favor of the 4, but unless you have plenty of disposable income, it's probably not worth the upgrade (especially if you have to a lot of accessories you will have to replace).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Apple's new, fast release cycle, the iPad 5 could be just around the corner and it won't feel good to buy a new tablet and see it become obsolete in a few months twice in a row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that doesn't mean that Apple doesn't have the iPad 3 owners covered. It's just that for them the iPad mini is the bigger draw - portable, easy to type on, better to play some games on (in terms of controls, plus lower resolution balances out the dated GPU). It's a lot cheaper than the iPad 4 ($170 for the base models) and since it shares its hardware with the iPad 2, it's probably the most enticing of the three tablets Apple offers at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Apple iPad 3 Wi-Fi ? Apple iPad 2 Wi-Fi ? Apple iPad mini Wi-Fi</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For 10-or-so inch tablets, there are plenty of Androids to choose from. The biggest non-domestic threat to the iPad 4 is certainly the Google Nexus 10. Featuring a higher-res screen (300ppi against the iPad 4's 264ppi) and a next-generation chipset, the Nexus 10 is still $100 cheaper than the Apple tablet on the base level. It also runs the latest Android version and given that Nexus devices are the first to be updated it will remain like this for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, of course, there's the S Pen-enabled Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 for the artistic types and heavy-duty note takers out there and the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity, which has its proper hardware keyboard and FullHD screen to lean on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Google Nexus 10 ? Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 N8000 ? Asus Transformer Pad Infinity 700</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those looking for a tablet to replace their netbook, there's the new kid on the block - the Microsoft Surface. Offering those clever keyboard covers, Microsoft's first tablet promises to bring all the goodness of the Windows experience, coupled with a touch-friendly and intuitive UI to a handheld.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Vivo RT offers the same, but with a Transformer-like keyboard instead. The Samsung Ativ Tab counters with a newer and more efficient chipset - a Krait-packing Snapdragon instead of the Tegra 3 that powers the other two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app selection for Windows 8 RT is limited for now, but the shared core between that and the Windows 8 gives developers vast capabilities, so things are bound to improve in the future. Opting for a Windows 8 RT tablet now is a gamble, but one that might pay off handsomely in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Microsoft Surface ? Asus VivoTab RT ? Samsung Ativ Tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the iPad came out, tablets were odd, rare (and clunky) beasts, now they're often top priority on people's holiday shopping lists. The iPad 4 may not be a stocking filler like those compact $200 droid tablets, but that won't prevent many people (we are talking a few million here) from buying it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware is top notch and iOS still has by far the best and biggest collection of tablet-optimized apps. For the first time though, it seems that record-doubling and tripling sales are a tad less certain for the Cupertino flagship slate. The Apple iPad 4 has to share the spotlight with the mini, and cannot count on too many iPad 3 owners getting a massive urge to upgrade.</paragraph>
