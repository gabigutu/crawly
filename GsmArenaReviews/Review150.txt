			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson T707 is a new addition to the T-series but it's nothing like the T-series as you know them. Not only is it the first flip in the bunch, it also has a different brief than virtually any other T-series handset. Codenamed Elle, Sony Ericsson T707 will be trying to please the ladies but maybe it's not as simple as just sticking that less-a-gadget, more-an-accessory label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As one of the product designers claims, the Sony Ericsson T707 was inspired by rainbows and the array of paintjobs it will be released in will make sure it won't go unnoticed. The light effects, the stealthy external screen and the ripple-and-circle patterns inside give this otherwise modest mid-ranger a distinct personality and visual appeal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have put quite some effort into advertizing the T707 as an all-around stylish package that's even fit for the tennis star Maria Sharapova as seen from the numerous photo ads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Sony Ericsson T707 is where rainbows are made - the exterior is surely an eye catcher. The light effects it offers are a way to add a bit of individuality integrated with practical functionality - the two circular elements on the front panel can be backlit in a choice of five different colors and these colors are in fact assignable to individual contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>For our review we received the Sony Ericsson T707 in Mysterious Black. Now that we've got our proper introduction, we'd gladly take you down the road with an inspection of looks and ergonomics. See you on the next page?</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson T707 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson T707 flip opening mechanism is quite smooth however we'd prefer it to be more springy. But then again that might be an issue only with our pre-production unit as a Sony Ericsson W508 we saw had a quite more assisting punch to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 14.1 mm thick, the Sony Ericsson T707 is not more than a millimeter thicker than most other clamshells, and the 95 grams render it pleasantly solid. The overall weight is nicely balanced too, so it quite comfortable to hold as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The T707 display is by no means big, 2.2" screens are better suited for bar phones. The plenty of unused frame around it makes it look even smaller. It has QVGA resolution and supports displaying up to 256K colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general the T707 primary display performs nicely and remains altogether legible under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad is totally flat and the spacing between keys is excessive, which makes touch orientation very difficult. Key stroke is quite shallow, which hinders typing feedback. That being said, it's interesting to note, that the entire lower deck styling is a near complete rip-off of a year-old Sony Ericsson low-ender - the R306 Radio. We didn't like its keypad either. But het, it may be subject to mechanical improvements, our T707 unit still a pre-production one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if not the best in terms of usability, one thing we like about the keypad is the texture of super fine grooves that is quite pleasant to the touch and provides a very firm grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The T707 keypad illuminates gradually, lighting up in three steps - D-pad first, navigation keys next, and finally the bunch of alphanumeric keys. Of course, at this stage key backlighting is not perfect, but it will probably be improved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the T707 only houses an exposed FastPort. Sony Ericsson still refuse to cover that aperture, which is a real nuisance to design uniformity as far as our taste goes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the T707 right-hand side are the volume rocker and a misleadingly looking slit with M2 etched next to it. We said misleadingly, because the card slot is not accessible from the side. Instead, it's under the battery cover and the slit is just to help you pull the back cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device is made of matte plastic, which feels nice and rubbery although it's not completely immune to fingerprints. It features the Sony Ericsson logo and the loudspeaker. Again, much like some other Sony Ericsson phones, the logo is slightly raised, making the handset wobbly on an even surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it's time to finally close the flip</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external cover of T707 is where rainbows are made - the exterior is no less that eye-catching. The front panel houses both a secondary display plus some hidden light effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exterior surface looks quite elegant even though it doesn't quite stand closer inspection - the panel looks like the dark color was actually printed on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary display is hidden in the large semi-circle and when it's off, it blends in with the shiney black surface, which is also advertized as scratch resistant, so it shouldn't loose its gloss. That black plastic however is exactly what makes the outer display totally illegible under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external display itself is not very big and is just monochrome but manages to squeeze in information about the time, battery status, signal strength and missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large semi-circle is part of the light-effects that the T707 offers - it actually consists of two concentric circles that pulse with white light when the phone is ringing. Further on the little concave circle in the lower right corner of the front panel also lights up in color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both these circular elements can be backlit in a choice of five different colors - amber, amethyst, beryl, diamond and sapphire - and these colors are in fact assignable to individual contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The light effects also work as an indicator for missed calls, but they blink in too large intervals and don't use the color specified for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And unfortunately, the light effects seem too dim and it's really hard to tell the difference between colors unless you're in a dark room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The T707 front panel also houses the lens of an unambitious 3.15 megapixel camera with fixed focus and Cell-ID geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the T707 back cover there's nothing surprising - a BST-39 Li-Ion battery of 930 mAh capacity plus the SIM and memory card slot. The memory card slot is just a regular M2 card slot, unlike what the Sony Ericsson specs report. At the time of writing this, Sony Ericsson state on their website that T707 has additional support for microSD cards, but that's highly unlikely to be true and is most probably a mistake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson T707 feels solid and compact in the hand, built of materials, which are pleasant to touch. The hinge could have been just a little stronger but other than that the T707 is quite enjoyable to work with. The flat keyboard however throws any chance of touch-typing out the window. Pity, the clamshell has plenty of room for big and comfortable keys.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: like a deja vu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T707 interface is the regular Sony Ericsson feature phone UI that is used in most of their top handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with information on top indicating signal strength, currently used data carrier and battery status. At the bottom of the display, just above the context keys are their labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard foursome - theme-dependent, 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view. There nothing that we haven't seen. But if you're new to Sony Ericsson's latest devices, check out our in-depth review of Sony Ericsson C903 that we wrote recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode can only work with a SIM card in the device and requires a restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is visually appealing and snappy. Since the handset lacks an accelerometer, auto rotation isn't enabled in the Media Center in contrast to its Walkman-labeled twin brother, the W508.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson T707 supports Flash Lite themes, which change the color scheme and wallpaper. Our handset has four themes preinstalled: Clarity, Dandelion, Forest tale, and Pink lilac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice thing about Flash themes is that they can be made dynamic. We've seen various implementations with Sony Ericsson phones - for example the themes on T707 change their hue according to the time of day. We've also seen Sony Ericsson Flash themes that display new artwork on selected days such as international public holidays and such.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, you can also use an application as a background instead of an actual image.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is traditional<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way you can set up the phone to autosave to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up your contacts list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of the contact is written in only one field, but you still have the option to sort contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and it does it very well. Naturally, you can search by gradual typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before we see how that little fella handles calls we'll take a closer look at one of the intriguing features it packs - the gesture control. While you may have seen it before (in the preview of Sony Ericsson W380, for instance) but it still remains a unique feature to Sony Ericsson handsets and it deserves its due attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So here's how gesture control works. Once you get a call or your alarm goes off, the Sony Ericsson T707 activates the front-panel camera and uses it for motion detection - something even cheap webcams can do nowadays. Then you just wave your hand in front of the lens and the call or alarm gets silenced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson T707 offers videocall functionality, but since there is no front-facing videocall camera, it's more like videocall sharing - meaning that you can see the other party on your display but you can only share what your primary camera "sees".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that handling of regular voice calls is excellent with T707 and we didn't experience any voice quality or reception problems. Call clarity is great in both the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing or Smart Search as Sony Ericsson are calling it is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the Sony Ericsson T707 stacks up against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. More info on our test, and all results so far, are stocked here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Green light for threaded messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson T707 handles all common types of messages, all of which - save for emails - share a common inbox. The phone also supports push email but can't handle any documents that are attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of a document reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like all the recent Sony Ericsson phones, the Sony Ericsson T707 has enhanced message sorting - the so-called Conversations mode or otherwise known as Threaded messaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversations mode is the alternative conversation-style layout, which displays message in threads - the SMS communication with a certain contact is organized as blobs much like in an instant messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with what other standard messaging functionality is there, Sony Ericsson T707 offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts, and the option to assign categories to messages. The Manage Messages application. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Media Center: entertainer by nature<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson T707 runs the flash-based Media Center. Its menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, Games, RSS feeds and Settings icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery stores the shots you've taken along with the prebundled wallpapers. Autorotation is unfortunately not available, but you can still rotate images to landscape orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are generally displayed as a 3 x 4 grid of thumbs. The shots in the dedicated Camera Album are sorted by the date they were taken on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening an image makes the thumb zoom in to fullscreen view mode, while exiting the fullscreen view smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson T707 doesn't sport an inbuilt GPS receiver, but it can still geotag camera images by triangulating your position using network cells information. If you pair it to an external Bluetooth GPS receiver, it will use it to geotag the image more precisely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter whether you use Cell-ID or real GPS geotagging, you still get the View on map option in the image gallery. It allows you to check the place where the shot has been taken directly on the map using the preinstalled Google Maps application (data charges may apply).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player to be found in Sony Ericsson T707 is version 3.0 - a slightly abridged edition of Walkman player 3.0. The player supports numerous file formats plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening. The music player can naturally be set to run in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface colors of the Media center vary across different themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in the Media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, and the interface is simple and stylish. The video files are accessible via the file manager too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video section also houses the pre-installed YouTube client. It gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarked favorites and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FM radio with RDS and TrackID</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of Sony Ericsson T707 has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has a nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player but offers none of the fancy fullscreen graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID functionality is the same we know devices like the Sony Ericsson C903.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of Sony Ericsson T707 bears the typical for the company mid-range handsets traits. Much like the Sony Ericsson W595 it offers excellent scores on most readings and a disastrous frequency response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response deviates severely from the textbook rules. It has extremely boosted bass and treble and reduced mid frequency sounds. The graph looks as if an equalizer has been applied only that it wasn't. We can hardly imagine how far off the frequency response would be if you actually apply one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side all of the other readings are pretty good with the distortion levels simply great. The stereo crosstalk, the noise level and the dynamic range are also nothing short of excellent. You can see for yourselves that save for the frequency response the Sony Ericsson T707 is quite a gifted musician. You can also notice its resemblance to some of the other Sony Ericsson handsets we have tested recently.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel snapper to capture your moments<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera shoots in a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. Regretfully, it has no autofocus, nor flash. Pictures are taken with the handset held in portrait mode, part of the display serving as the viewfinder. The center of the navigation key is the capture button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options include white balance, shot mode, geotagging and different effects. You can capture panorama shots by taking three consecutive shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is quite short exceptional, but we suspect it won't be a deal breaker for you if you have set your eyes on the T707 anyway. At the moment the noise-suppressing processing is pretty harsh on the details giving the photos a watercolor painting effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However you've got to remember our T707 is a pre-release unit so the camera will most probably be tuned differently (better) in the final retail product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording on T707 is limited to QVGA resolution at 15 frames per second - there are no surprises here. It's like most of the Sony Ericsson handsets in this class and we won't even bother publishing a sample.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fluid browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson T707 comes with nice the Access NetFront web browser v3.4 featuring the extended home screen, also available in the other recent Sony Ericsson handsets. Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen, right under a search and an address bar. The appearance of the home screen changes to various bright colors each time you start the browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elaborate web pages are rendered well and there are lots of configurable settings too. There is full screen viewing mode. The panning/scrolling speed is up to standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson T707 web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer, which is nice to work with. Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is on par with what the market segment demands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T707 scores highly on connectivity options. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board for worldwide roaming. HSDPA is also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, the Sony Ericsson T707 offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options. There is also support for the A2DP profile allowing you to listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. Last, but not least, there is also the M2 card slot, which is often one of the quickest ways of transferring data.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson T707 offers a wide range of time-management features as usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms app will hardly need any introduction. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the additional applications, Sony Ericsson T707 comes with the well known AccuWeather, Comeks Strips and a new one - Emotional PIM. The latter is an animated digital clock with some nice effects and can be used for wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the name suggests, its other function is to show the upcoming organizer events - appointments, birthdays and tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PhotoDJ, VideoDJ and MusicDJ plus Bluetooth remote control are signature features for all Sony Ericsson phones, and are available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Available for free download and compatible with a variety of mobile OS and Java-enabled handsets, Google Maps for Mobile come preinstalled on the Sony Ericsson T707.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two different view modes are available - Satellite and Map view and the user interface is clean and intuitive. Traffic information is another important feature here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After defining a start and end location, the possible routes are being calculated with overall guidance based on the available information in the database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson T707 comes with only one preloaded game - Real Football 2008.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that Sony Ericsson T707 is wonderful mid-range handset. It has all you may need from it - 3G support, a 3 mega pixel snapper, a M2 memory slot, FM radio and stylish design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately to T707, the mid-range market that the handset targets has already been heavily bombarded by nice-looking all-touch handsets such as LG Cookie or Samsung S5600 and S5230. Since touch is all the rage these days and it's only recently been made affordable to the masses, we somehow don't really see a profitable business case for old-school clamshells anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Cookie ? Samsung S5600 ? Samsung S5230</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, for die-hard clamshell fans, the Sony Ericsson T707 represents a really nice and stylish package. Since we don't know the projected retail price we can hardly compare it to any competing products. Still, if you are after a stylish clamshell, you might want to look at Nokia 6600 fold, which is also a gorgeous device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6600 fold</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At a more moderate price (around 150 euro at the time of writing), the Nokia 7510 Supernova can also fill in the blank for a clamshell competitor with its nice light effects, hidden external display and exchangeable external panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you need a little bit of a music bump, you shouldn't forget that the T707 has its twin brother in Walkman cloths - the Sony Ericsson W508, which will be available even earlier than the T707 itself. It adds external touch-sensitive music keys, an accelerometer and a secondary video call camera, while keeping the fancy gesture control. We still don't have pricing info on this one too, but patience is a virtue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, there's plenty of competition, so whether Sony Ericsson T707 makes it or not, will be a matter of really tight pricing policy. As usual, when you're out shopping, always have an eye on what the competition offers and you can't go wrong.</paragraph>
