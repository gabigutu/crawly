			<paragraph>We finally had a chance to put some time into developing a handful of new features for our site, so with the hot summer behind us, we rolled up our sleeves to shape several novelties that we?ve been reflecting on lately. We bet you?ll be seeing more of them as time goes by, but we decided to give you the heads-up in one single article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Possibly the hottest one of the three geeky features to officially debut today, is our 360-degree spin of mobile devices. Pulling those off really made us sweat a bit, but it seems we did manage to get the hang of it. Here are several samples for you to spin away. We will be adding that feature to our reviews and to our mobile phones specs page. It?s a modest start but we hope for it to catch quickly, as more and more mobile phones are hitting our office. Anyway, without further ado, check out those babies.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Until recently, sound quality used to be a subjective matter in our reviews. Realizing that mobile phones are more than ever used as portable music players, subjective just won't do any more. That is why we at GSMArena will be including a new audio tests in our reviewing routine - the audio quality test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give you a more objective view of how the music players perform in all those handsets we review, we decided to record audio samples of each device, analyze the results and publish those for your geeky pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It must be pointed out that we are not testing the retail headsets that come with the various handsets - our audio quality test concerns only the quality of the music player output. A mediocre set of headphones will obviously make things worse than they are in our tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to record the samples needed for analysis we use the M-Audio Fast Track Pro external audio interface, which has decent enough capabilities to allow testing even the most high-quality portable music players. You can find its quick Line Input specs here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having the right hardware, however, is not enough to do the job. We chose the RightMark Audio Analyzer (RMAA) software to do all the analyzing. First off, we use a calibration sound (generated by RMAA) in order to set the input levels right each time. Then we play a special test tone (again, generated by RMAA) which allows the software to evaluate the signal captured real time with the M-Audio Fast Track Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this gives us the opportunity to create a controlled environment, which should produce accurate and comparable results throughout all the units tested. With all the handsets, we test how they perform both at the maximum volume level, as well as several notches down. This is mainly due to the reason that some music players can produce a lot of distortion at the highest volume levels, while they would play perfectly fine at a moderate volume level. It's also worth saying that during the tests we disable all available equalizer settings and sound enhancements, that the handset music players may be equipped with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RMAA software produces results on several important aspects of sound quality. Usually, the high-quality sound reproduction should demonstrate minimal or unnoticeable levels of noise and distortion, and an accurate frequency response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response curves seen on our RMAA generated graphs are often used to indicate the accuracy of amplifiers and speakers in reproducing audio. Good frequency response does not guarantee a specific fidelity, but only indicates that a piece of equipment meets the basic frequency response requirements. As an example, a high fidelity amplifier may be said to have a frequency response of 20 Hz - 20,000 Hz ±1 dB. This means that the system amplifies all bands from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz with a maximum positive or negative deviation from the straight line of only 1 dB. Larger deviations below 40 Hz or above 15 kHz are OK, since the human ear is unable to perceive those sounds. Here lower absolute numbers mean the handset treats all sounds equally; it won't impose its will on the music but will allow you to hear the music as it was recorded, which is what a good piece of audio equipment should do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise levels are the next important aspect of sound reproduction. As seen in our tests, noise is usually measured in relation to the signal levels, otherwise known as the signal-to-noise ratio. In less technical terms the signal-to-noise ratio compares the level of a desired signal (such as music) to the level of background noise ('background' meaning unwanted interferences created by the equipment). So the higher the signal-to-noise ratio, the less obtrusive the background noise, hence the reproducing equipment is of a higher quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dynamic range is another important factor. The human sense of hearing has a very high dynamic range. A person is capable of hearing anything from a quiet murmur in a soundproofed room to the sound of the loudest rock concert. A difference like this can be up to 100dB. A person however cannot perform these feats of perception at both extremes of the scale simultaneously - you cannot hear a whisper in a noisy street for example. Nevertheless, a good quality audio reproduction system should be able to reproduce accurately both the quiet sounds and the loud at the same time. Audio engineers often use the term dynamic range to describe the ratio of the loudest possible undistorted sound to the quietest or to the noise level, say of a microphone or loudspeaker. This dynamic range of an audio device is also sometimes referred to as the dynamic window. To mathematically determine a dynamic range you must take the difference between the ceiling and the noise floor of an audio device. For example, if the ceiling of a device is 10 dB and the floor is 3 dB then the dynamic range is 7 dB, since 

 10 - 3 = 7
. So the larger the dynamic range (or otherwise the dynamic window), the better the device performs at reproducing quiet and loud sounds simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The total harmonic distortion (THD) and the intermodulation distortion (IMD) might be the next items you will notice on our measurement results. By the name you know they are a measure of the unwanted altering of the original signals. Distortion is the name given to anything that alters a pure input signal in any way other than changing its magnitude. So, as you might have guessed it, the lower the number, the better the sound reproduction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo crosstalk is another thing of importance that we measure in our tests. Crosstalk measurement is made to determine the amount of signal leaking across from one channel to another or in purely non-technical terms it measures how good the stereo is. So, the higher the absolute value, the better the stereo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are unable to post results retroactively for the mobile handsets that have already been reviewed at GSMarena.com but we will do our best to collect sound analysis data for all the handsets we can get our hands on from now on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the meantime, you can have a look at the data collected from handsets that were available at the time we made the tests. It is presented in a tabular form but you will find that there are links to frequency response and noise graphs. You might like to browse and compare them too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 20 Sep 2010: Recently we decided to add some additional testing in our usual audio quality testing routine. The numbers we've published so far reflect the phone performance when plugged into an active amplifier (i.e. your car stereo or your home audio system). Since recently, we started testing each phone two times. The second try is with headphones attached. As it turns out in many cases the added resistance of the headphones makes the audio output quality worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We use a pair of AKG headphones with impedance of 32 ohms for each of those special second runs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you pay closer attention, you might notice a suspicious resemblance between the results produced by the Samsung handsets and the iPod unit we were testing. We were caught off guard too and we even thought we had some kind of a problem with our test setup. But after we checked on the matter, it turned out that Samsung are in fact supplying Apple with audio processors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Speakerphone loudness test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having a handset with a nice loudspeaker is a definite plus for almost every user. Most modern handsets have a speakerphone function, sometimes advertised as a built-in hands-free. Having the voice of the other calling party sounding loud and clear is obviously a must. Teenagers on the other hand like to use the loudspeaker to listen to music on their own outings or get-togethers (yeah, we know the sound quality sucks). But stepping out of these scenarios, you would hardly need us telling you that every phone is as good as its ringing. After all, that's its primary job - alerting you of incoming calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So one way or another, whether you use it for fun, conference calls or just for plain ringing, there is one single thing that's important - loudness. We've never dug into that in our reviews besides the casual subjective remark of whether the handset ringing is loud or not, but we decided it's time we took a more scientific approach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So we got ourselves a nice piece of equipment - a digital noise/loudness meter in order to start measuring objectively that all-important aspect of modern handsets - how loud is the loudspeaker in realty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The equipment in question is not a high-end one, but we really don't need one. All we need for our reviews is a way to measure the maximum (peak) loudness level that our handsets reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, for the record, here is how our test setup goes. We do our tests in a quiet room taking sound measurements with the handset loudspeaker facing the microphone at a distance of exactly 1 m. We do three different tests. For each test we make several consequent measurements - we usually disregard the highest and the lowest readings and we take the average value of the rest. The three tests are as follows:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1) A phone ringing. We use an old-school ringtone, resembling the ringing of an old phone. It seems that most phones do well when we use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>2) Pink noise. We use a sample of pink noise. Our readings with it are pretty indicative on how well the handset loudspeaker would fare with common music. Teenagers would surely appreciate the handset that will allow them to crank up the volume as high as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3) Human voice, male. This is an important test, since if you tend the use the loudspeaker for speakerphone purposes, loudness is really important, no matter if you are at the conferencing room, or in your car.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, all this pretty much sums it up nicely. Let us just point out that this test is not about the quality of the sound produced by the loudspeaker. A mild, relatively deep sounding loudspeaker that soothes the ear won't do well in this test. But, all we are after is pure loudness levels - it's our hunt for the loudest phone, ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And one final remark so you can interpret our readings better. We measure sound loudness in decibel (dB). Bear in mind that the decibel is a logarithmic unit, which means that a reading of +3dB represents roughly twice more power. Although power itself doesn't have a direct relation to our test, it just comes to show that even a slight difference in readings might mean audibly louder results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, as we do all this with the mobile user on mind, we would really like to know how helpful our effort is. We hope the new features are bringing extra value, but with them our reviews take longer to complete. And we're hoping to strike the right balance between added functionality and timely serving our audience. We welcome any of your feedback on how useful and relevant our add-ons are. Your opinion matters to us.</paragraph>
