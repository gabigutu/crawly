			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A flagship, a mini and a phablet. From there on, it's all you Desire. This pretty much sums up the Taiwanese smartphone portfolio where the once premium Desire line is doing double and triple shifts to cover all kinds of price brackets, shapes and sizes in the midrange. It's a place where dual SIM support is closer to a must-have than a nice-to-have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual-SIM has bits of the character of the current flagship but some of the smarts have been obviously traded for size and an extra SIM slot. There's no mistaking where the Desire 700 got its looks from but instead of a gapless aluminum unibody this one has been treated to glossy plastic. The upside is a detachable back panel and hence, a removable battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 5 inches, the Desire 700's screen is bigger than the 4.7-inch screen of the HTC One, but the qHD resolution means that the pixel density is at lower-midrange levels. The good news is the front-mounted stereo speakers are available here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back isn't adorned in Ultrapixel glory but a regular 8MP camera more than suffices for the price range. The HTC Desire 700 greets you with Sense 5 atop the aging Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean with, hopefully, an update to at least Android 4.3 in the works (and the more advanced Sense 5.5 in tow).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hoping to balance price-conscious decisions and delivering value to customers, the Desire 700 dual-SIM looks like a good match for the Asian markets where a big screen and multiple SIM slots go a long way. That said, like others before it, the Desire 700 will certainly find its way to the old continent, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's see everything the HTC Desire 700 dual-SIM has to offer in our breakdown below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual SIM has screen size, battery capacity and full-HD video capability over the predecessor, the Desire 600 dual SIM. But six months later, it's not the straightforward upgrade that HTC was after - the Desire 700 and its siblings mark a strategic shift for the company. In an attempt to lower the production costs, the Taiwanese have switched chipset suppliers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 700 is powered by a China-made Spreadtrum Shark running four Cortex-A7 cores at 1.2GHz. The immediate benefit is 1080p video recording but we're yet to see what kind of compromise the low-cost chipset makes and how it compares against lower-end Snapdragons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, of course, we'll look at what makes - or breaks - the Desire 700 as a viable option for users requiring two SIM slots. We are ready to give this one the benefit of the doubt, so step right in as we try and make up our minds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's nothing out of the usual about the retail package of the HTC Desire 700 dual sim, which does well to tick the necessary boxes without letting the budget get out of hand. There's a standalone A/C adapter, a microUSB cable and a pretty average set of earphones - clearly not the premium variety you get with pricier HTC phones, complete with volume controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire 700 dual sim 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim is clearly based upon the iconic HTC One design - but the relationship is distant. And we mean no distance too long or too short for the actual price difference. Anyway, although a reasonably good-looking phone, the Desire 700 dual SIM ergonomics could've been better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By providing a bigger 5" screen (over the One's 4.7-incher) and retaining the front-facing stereo speakers, the Desire 700 is even taller. Five-inchers like the Samsung Galaxy S4 and LG G2 are smaller by comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weight is reasonable at 149g - heavier than the aluminum-made One. Thickness isn't all that impressive either, standing at 10.3 mm. Overall the Desire 700 looks alright, never mind the extra coat of gloss.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front is where the Desire 700's resemblance to the flagship is the strongest. The bezel around the 5" screen is reasonably thin and the pair of plastic grilles with BoomSound tech are conveniently placed for watching videos or playing games with the sound meeting you head on, instead of being spilled away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is curved, sloping towards the edges of the front. The frame running all around the sides is a soft and darker plastic, drawing a line between the front and the removable battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nicely curved, the Desire 700 feels nice to handle (a tad too slippery perhaps) but is overall bigger than most people would find comfortable - single-handed use is near impossible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera is placed above the screen next to the speaker. The proximity and ambient light sensors are on the opposite side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive Back and Home buttons are squeezed between the screen and the bottom speaker. A double tap on the home button will launch the task switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the HTC Desire 700 holds no controls, while the volume keys are traditionally on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another position that's pretty much set in stone on HTC handsets is the power button. The thing is it's nearly impossible to reach single-handedly on a device the size of the Desire 700. We would've reluctantly agreed if it was doubling as an IR blaster like on the One - but that isn't the case here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the power button there's the 3.5 mm headphone jack, while on the bottom we find the microUSB port and the sole microphone (the HTC Desire 700 doesn't have a noise-suppressing mic).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera lens and single LED flash are on the back of the device. At the bottom, the rear cover has a small slit to put a fingernail and pull open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 700 is powered by a 2100mAh battery, and all three slots are accessible without having to remove the battery from its compartment. The primary SIM supports 3G speeds, while the second is stuck on 2G. The microSD card slot lets you expand the phone's storage by up to 64GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 700 dual SIM is a reasonably good-looking phone but let down by the details. The top-placed power button is way out of comfortable reach and the glossy finish certainly takes away design points - in a phone that otherwise tried to emulate the flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, it actually tops the flagship with a removable battery and expandable storage. And yes, it has a bigger screen and an extra SIM slot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700's screen has qHD resolution (540 x 960px), which at a diagonal of 5 inches, works out to a pixel density of around 220 ppi. Suffice to say, it?s not the sharpest around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, the Desire 700 screen has good colors and the viewing angles are well above average for a LCD panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the matrix of the display under a microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the numbers in our dedicated test, the Desire 700 dual SIM has good contrast levels and impressive brightness. What's not quite up to par is the depth of blacks, which gets worse the higher the brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility test shows how much the screen contrast ratio deteriorates under direct sunlight. The Desire 700 dual sim managed a good result, albeit far from the best out there. It will remain legible even in the strongest sunlight.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 managed to both surprise and disappoint in our battery test. The 2100mAh unit got a rating of 52 hours. That's the expected time between charges if you do an hour of calling, an hour of web browsing and an hour of video watching a day (counting the stand-by battery drain as well). For this test we had both SIM slots occupied with active SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With outstanding call times and good enough browsing, it was the video playback test where the Desire 700's battery failed to impress. More on the breakdown here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Outdated Android 4.1.2 coupled with outdated Sense 5.0 UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim runs Android 4.1.2 with Sense UI 5. It's a bit behind the curve with the more premium HTC One and One Max, which are rocking Android 4.3 and Sense 5.5 with upcoming updates to 4.4 KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, HTC has treated its dual simer with some of its attractive proprietary software features such as BlinkFeed and Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick showcase of the HTC Desire 700 dual sim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Sense goes against the grain of most Android custom launchers and relies heavily on vertical scrolling, which can take some getting used to if you're coming from a different brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is the first place you'd encounter it - it's a stream of articles from around the web delivered directly to your homescreen combined with account updates from the social network services you might be using, such as Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap on an item you get a preview with one big picture and a short blurb. Social networking items open the respective app instead. You can also search BlinkFeed and post updates to social networks straight from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is a part of the homescreen - the leftmost pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can long press on the homescreen or do a pinch zoom out gesture to enter the homescreen edit mode. Here you can add and remove homescreen panes, rearrange existing ones and set one of them as Home (the Home buttons brings you there). The only limitation is that you can't remove or rearrange the BlinkFeed, which is always the leftmost homescreen pane. As we saw from the other HTC smartphones this limitation is only removed from Android 4.3 Jelly Bean (Sense 5.5) upwards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android app drawer is the second place where HTC went with vertical scrolling instead of the more popular paged interface. The drawer displays a 3 x 4 grip of shortcuts by default (which leaves a lot of padding around icons). You can use folders to group similar apps and make better use of the screen space. The other option is to switch to a 4 x 5 grid in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that to access the settings in the app drawer and BlinkFeed you have to swipe down. The Desire 700 dual sim doesn't have a Menu button, but you can assign the long press action of the Home button to cover for it. If you do that, you'll give up its default purpose of opening Google Now - which will be a swipe up gesture instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the app drawer is a big clock with date and weather info (a big icon and smaller text with more details). This same clock is at the top of the BlinkFeed screen, which makes the two feel very similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcut dock at the bottom holds four shortcuts plus the app drawer button in the middle. These icons are always visible - in BlinkFeed, in the regular screens, in the app drawer, even on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is pretty much stock Android - it shows only notifications by default (below the top row, which is reserved for the time and date, plus two shortcuts). There aren't any quick toggles for system settings, a feature that we very much miss. The other HTC phones running Android 4.2.2 already have that sorted out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the same goes for the widget lockscreen feature, which is present only on devices running Android 4.2.2 and up. As a result, on the Desire 700 dual sim you only get a traditional lockscreen with four non-customizable app shortcuts with the time and weather displaying above them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no way to change lockscreen shortcuts independently from the ones docked on the homescreen. Many users may find that inconvenient - LG and Samsung both let you do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has fiddled with the app switcher - it is now launched by double tapping the Home key. It shows a 3 x 3 grid of thumbnails of the recent apps. The upside is that you don't have to scroll like you do in the regular Android app switcher, the downside is that you can't scroll at all even if you wanted to - you only get to see the last 9 apps and no more (though for some that's quite enough). You can swipe up to dismiss an app (which leaves an empty slot, an older app doesn't fill its place).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an interesting option in the phone's Security settings, borrowed from the Windows Phone 8 playbook. It's called Kid mode and it is actually an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they can have access to. One annoying bit is that to enable Kid mode the first time around, you need to sign up via email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim also comes with a dedicated Car mode screen, which has been styled to look like the rest of the interface. There are only five big controls besides the clock and weather info. There's music info too, which takes a whole row by itself, along with shortcuts to Navigation, Dialer, the Music player (again) and Voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense customizations also extend to the Settings menu - HTC has prettified it a bit with custom icons and added several new options (like Media output and Personalize).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're upgrading from another phone, you should give the Setup app a spin. It hooks up to your old phone over Bluetooth and pulls all the data it can, even things that Google doesn't sync (settings and such, not just the contacts). This also works for phones that can't sync with Google, like various feature phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim packs a quad-core CPU and 1GB of RAM. The chipset is made by a company we are not so familiar with - Spreadtrum. Their Shark chipset uses Cortex-A7 cores as opposed to the Cortex-A5s on the Desire 600's Snapdragon 200, so we expected its performance to be around the same mark as the one of the Snapdragon 400.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four cores run at 1.2GHz each. The Spreadtrum Shark also includes the now ageing Mali-400 GPU alongside 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cortex-A7 cores aren't the best performers out there so we don't expect much from the Spreadtrum Shark in the following series of benchmark tests. Still, these cores should be able to outperform the Cortex-A5 cores in the Snapdragon 200 easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-threaded performance was quite disappointing - the Desire 700 dual sim even came behind the Desire 600 dual sim.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench is a compound benchmark, which tests memory speed in addition to CPU performance. Here, the Desire 700 dual sim got the last place. The least we can say is it didn't fare well against its Snapdragon 400 competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu put the HTC Desire 700 dual sim slightly below the One mini and above the Desire 600 dual sim and the Galaxy Ace 3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant gave the Desire 700 dual sim the boot, placing it with the smartphone ending light-years behind smartphones that are much cheaper than it like the Motorola Moto G.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Basemark X tests a little bit of everything but since we have only used it on flagship devices so far, the Desire 700 dual sim never stood a chance of getting anything but the last spot in our results table.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because of the now-low-end Mali-400 that's running the graphics department in the Spreadtrum Shark, we had to reside back to the NenaMark 2 benchmark. Unlike mid- and high-end devices, the Desire 700 dual sim GPU didn't max out this test, but it still led the Adreno 203 by 18 frames.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put the graphic prowess of the Mali-400 in perspective we performed the T-Rex 1080p offscreen test - the Desire 700 dual sim managed to pump out mere 3.2 frames per second, although chances are it will never have to face 1080p screens in real life.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Epic Citadel delivered a very solid score for the Desire 700 dual sim, but you have got to bear in mind it runs at the native resolution - in this case 540 x 960 px so don't go rushing in comparing it to flagship phones, which have 1080p screens. It's still a good score from the Mali 400, showing why it's so successful years after its initial release in 2010.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it's time to move onto web performance testing. We start with the JavaScript benchmark SunSpider. Here, the HTC Desire 700 dual sim browser produced a mediocre showing, although it's about in line with what its specs sheet suggests. BrowserMark 2 and Vellamo told similar stories.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim obviously has problems with the benchmark performance at this stage. Barely beating Snapdragon 200 chipsets and their Cortex-A5 CPUs suggests that there's a lot of tuning still required. Good news is things aren't quite so dramatic in real life and the Desire 700 dual sim isn't terribly slow - in fact it's quite acceptable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As an integral part of Android Jelly Bean Google Now is available on the HTC Desire 700 dual sim. You can launch it by holding the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will serve information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to Google Now and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this in the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Google Now widget, which generates information for you based on what your interests are. You can put it on the lockscreen for at-a-glance info.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People app in Sense 5 has seen some minor changes too. Instead of clickable tabs at the bottom of the screen you get side-scrollable tabs on the top, which is a more convenient solution (and along the lines of stock Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the HTC Desire 700 dual sim has an extra SIM card slot, the software has been obliged to deliver the extra functionality. Firing the contacts app for the first time prompts you which contacts to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well by tapping the ellipsis button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and finally the "Gallery" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook. These tabs can be hidden and rearranged too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more. If a contact is linked with a Facebook or other account you can see them either merged or choose to view either profile. In fact, the phone will automatically suggest to do that when it thinks two entries are for the same person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is Block contact - the Desire 700 dual sim will block all calls, texts and other messages from that contact. You can add any number too, which is great if you get spam messages from an automatic number. You can later check the call and message history from those contacts and get them out of the dog house if you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony works like a charm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim did great in our signal test, providing stellar reception in environments where there is the occasional dropped call. The volume in the earpiece was sufficiently loud (we almost never used it at full volume) and voice clarity was really good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC Desire 700 dual sim displays your recent calls with the usual tabs above, accessible via side-swipes. There's smart dialing on the Desire 700 dual sim - once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even switch to a QWERTY keyboard instead of the phone keypad. Another nice feature is the button that unveils all the contact info and lets you do just about anything - send an email, assign a custom ringtone and so on. It's a handy way to find and do something with the right contact, not just for dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch is the call button, which is now split in two allowing you very easily to dial a person with either of the two SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problem we have with the smart dial is that it only suggests one contact at a time - if you want another one (e.g. both Dexter and Dee Dee match "de" or "33"), you have to keep typing until you find the right one, you can't just pick out of a list of 3-4 matching contacts as on most other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is voice dialing, you hit the button, wait a couple of seconds for the Desire 600 dual sim to get ready and say "Call Dexter". This is a little too slow for our liking though (the phone says "Just one moment", pauses, "Say a command when you're ready" and then you can talk).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim doesn't support video calling over the cellular network by default. The good news is there are a bunch of apps which could fill in the blank spot with video calling over Wi-Fi and 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, Quiet ring on pickup will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus of BoomSound speakers is not absolute loudness but quality of the sound. The Desire 700 dual sim mini scored a Good mark with results very similar to that of the regular HTC One, so HTC didn't skimp on the speakers. While the Desire 700 dual sim is not the loudest around, it's one of the most pleasant to listen to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging well set<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Desire 700 dual sim are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's Hangouts, which can connect you to Google's chat network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or half in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is pretty nice. Keys are well spaced but the overlay doesn't include any gaps between them, which is only a cosmetic feature and poses no discomfort. The 5" diagonal offers ample space for comfortable typing. Some keys can be long pressed to get additional symbols, which speeds up typing in some cases as you don't have to keep going back to the symbols section of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa. You can also enable arrow keys, which show up below the portrait keyboard (but not the landscape one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Prediction is available, even prediction for the next word you're about to type. When the phone has learned from you, it can get pretty good at guessing and saving you whole words. You can edit a personal dictionary of words and backup and restore it either to local storage or to an email account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has included the Trace keyboard, which acts like Swipe. You drag a finger over the desired keys and the phone predicts what you're trying to write. It works really well but language support is limited. Voice transcription is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the built-in HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color-coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs like many other Sense 5 apps. You can choose the Filters setting and show/hide the ones you want or rearrange the visible ones. You can choose from All, Favorites, Unread and Attached (hidden by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC Desire 700 dual sim lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Zoe is a wiz at photo retouching<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Zoe is more advanced than any other gallery on a phone and it was made possible by the dedicated HTC ImageChip. When you use the camera in Zoe mode, every time you press the shutter key, the phone captures up to 20 full res shots and a 3 second video (1 second before you press the shutter key and 2 seconds after). All that information is required for the advanced features of Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of those features is Events. Zoe can be used as a regular image gallery with photos stacked together by folders, but Events groups photos by when and where they were taken. Each event has a 30-second highlight video, which is stitched together from those 3 second clips plus a slideshow, including some of the pics. You can remove clips and add new ones to the highlight video, add a video effect and also include a background music (the tracks are preset, though it is possible to add new ones to the list).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos and multiple full-res shots come into play when editing images as well. Since the phone has a video of the scene during which the photo was taken, it can find moving objects and put a red X on them so that you can tap and remove the ones you want, but keep the rest. The result is lowly 720p image, which given the chipset limitations on the Desire 700 dual sim is understandable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe can also make sure everyone in the photo is smiling and their eyes are open - it detects all faces and circles them, then you can swipe to go through all available images of that face until you find the perfect one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another feature is called Sequence shot. It takes a shot of a moving object and it creates a cool "multiple exposure" effect where that object appears several times on the photo. It's perhaps easier to show the effect than explain it, here's a shot of a BMXer jumping over a ramp. You can tweak the effect by adding and removing clones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe's arsenal of effects doesn't end here - there are some vanity effects too. One such effect is Face contour, which allows you to easily slim someone's face. There's also Skin smoothing, an automatic lighting fix, Eye enhancer (which makes your subject's eyes open wider), Eye brightening, Red-eye removal and Anti-shine. The intensity of these effects is adjustable with a slider so you can fine tune it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's just the Retouch section of the Photo Editor. There are also effects, frames and transformations available. Basically, Zoe is nearly as potent as Photoshop in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, you can find a map with your geotagged images in the Gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player with very limited codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Video player on the HTC Desire 700 dual sim has a pretty simple interface. There isn't even a dedicated app, you just pick a video from the gallery. Anyway, you get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to launch the camera and a small square with the current time and battery charge. Those automatically hide after a few seconds, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player also supports DLNA and subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim was pretty abysmal in its video codec support. While some DivX and Xvid videos played fine (mostly 1 out of 3) and AVI files were okay (sans those with AC3 sound codecs - those played without sound) the Desire 700 dual sim failed to load MKV, WMV, MOV, pretty much any other type of file we threw at it. There are apps that can remedy the situation available in the Google Play store, though. And with the large display available on the HTC Desire 700 dual sim it's well worth it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player without Beats<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim comes with a custom music player, which lacks the Beats enhancement this time around. It can organize your music library by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders (we don't see this option very often). The phone will also easily stream songs over DLNA, you're not limited to the music library you have in the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has some handy features out of the box. It can automatically look for and download Album art and artist photos (you can limit it to Wi-Fi connections only) and it can also search for lyrics. The lyrics can be displayed either in karaoke mode or just as text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no equalizer on board, you just have the option to toggle Beats audio on or off. That's not ideal, but at least the BoomSound stereo speakers on the front of the Desire 600 dual sim are quite loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and it has even been integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good old FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the headphones or loudspeaker choice you also get Mono sound if the reception is poor. There's no Beats enhancement here as well, however, not is there a playback control card on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SoundHound shortcut will find out the name of the currently playing song for you and will offer to take you to a digital music store where you can buy it or lookup the song's lyrics or watch the video on YouTube.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim performance in our audio quality test was somewhat mixed. It was among the loudest smartphones out there, but it wasn't perfectly clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the first part the Desire 700 dual sim impressed with its noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings, but its distortion is higher than we've come to expect. The frequency response isn't perfect either, so despite the great volume levels it's not all rosy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things aren't much different when you plug in a pair of headphones. The distortion increases further, and while the stereo crosstalk remains among the better out there, the overall output is far from perfectly clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard 8MP camera could've been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels in 4:3 mode and up to 3264x1840 px ones in 16:9 mode. It's also capable of recording 1080p videos @ 30fps. There's an LED flash / video light, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a wide f/2.0 aperture and a dedicated image processing chip (HTC ImageChip). The lens has a field of view equivalent to 28mm, meaning it's wider than usual and lets you squeeze more stuff into the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface, or HTC ImageSense, is the same for both the still camera and the video camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's pretty simple, as well. There are two shutter keys (one for stills and one for video), above them is the gallery shortcut and below is the effects button. On the left side of the screen you get flash mode selector and the settings shortcut button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a tab on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on). There's also some other cool effects such as shallow depth of field , which lets you blur parts of a photo that fall outside a predefined circular area. It's like having Instagram built right into the stock camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim camera has touch focus and face detection; geotagging and smile shutter are also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shot mode button offers some more cool stuff - HDR photos, Panorama (with a gyro horizon), portrait, group portrait, landscape, whiteboard, close-up and, finally, low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Desire 700 dual sim camera produces pleasant-looking images. Colors appear nice and the photos have an appealing unprocessed look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, as a result from this laid-back processing they come out quite soft. That's strange as we are used to seeing oversharpened photos from phones and not undersharpened ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another drawback of this laid back processing is that the camera doesn't take care of the chromatic aberrations - this is probably the worst case of purple fringing we've seen in a phone. That's not to say that other cameraphones don't have to fight that same problem - they simply remove it with clever post-processing and end users don't get to see it. Yet here, it's all there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the HTC Desire 700 has a built-in HDR mode, but the effect is too exaggerated and the images aren't mixed too perfectly, so the results are far from exciting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the macro capabilities. Here the HTC Desire 700 produced stellar results. It was able to get really close to the target and produced nice detail with light blurring behind it for a result with a shallower depth of field.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video camera with HDR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim can shoot videos at up to 1080p resolution at 30fps. It has an HDR option for the video, but note that when you enable it, the camera's field of view gets narrower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a slow-mo video recording mode, which however is shot at a lower resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features continuous autofocus and you have the option to lock the focus during video recording, if it hunts too much in dynamic scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 files with a bitrate of around 14-15 Mbps. Sound is captured in mono with a lowly 96Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate. Framerate was hovering the 21-22 fps mark, making it not the smoothest around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Detail on the HTC Desire 700 videos was impressive and focusing was spot on. Colors were okay if on the colder side. Even sound is okay at mono. What really ruins the experience is the choppiness of the videos, due to the lower framerate. There were dropped frames as well. Here goes a sample for you guys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also prepped an HDR video sample, which has a resolution of 768 x 432 px. Maybe we've been spoiled by devices like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, but the slow motion quality of the Desire 700 isn't good and looks more like 240p to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR in video is the same deal as in imaging - not up to par - the video sample was barely distinguishable from the original sample and we decided it's not worth uploading.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity misses a few things compared to the One<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim has the usual quad-band GSM support, plus tri-band 3G HSPA+ on one of its SIM card slots. The other slot is limited to 2G GSM only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and stereo Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the Desire 700 dual sim with a PC. The long list of options includes Portable Wi-Fi hotspot, USB and Bluetooth tethering (the phone becomes a modem).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Portable Hotspot can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has baked in a simple SIM card manager application into the Desire 700 dual sim. It is dubbed Dual network manager and allows you to easily switch on and off either one of the two SIM card slots. An Airplane mode option is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim lacks a few connectivity options compared to the big HTC One - MHL, NFC and IR. No MHL means you can't connect the phone to a TV or attach USB storage. The IR blaster was used to control TVs and other home equipment (not to transfer data like in the old days).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are not necessarily deal breakers, but it's something you should know before you commit to the Desire 700 dual sim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the Desire 700 supports USB On-The-Go, which allows you to connect external USB peripherals and flash storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Wireless streaming you can stream content over Wi-Fi to any HDTV that supports the standard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser with Flash and GIFs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire 700 dual sim comes with the latest version of the Sensed-out Android web browser. Most of its UI is out of sight, leaving the entire screen to the web page. And even when it does appear it consists of a single bar, which now holds the address field, the Tabs and Menu dropdown shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking. Pages can be reflowed to better fit the screen and you can set things like default zoom, search engine and URL suggestion providers and so on. From the Labs setting you can enable Quick controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner - they can't be swiped off the screen like you do in the app switcher. Incognito tabs are available if you want to browse without leaving traces. There's a popup blocker to stave off annoying popups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another cool feature is preloading search results that the phone believes are relevant, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim comes with full Flash support in the browser (it's disabled by default). We tested a couple of games and videos and everything worked like a charm. Flash has almost been weeded out of the mobile web, but there are still a few stubborn sites, so it's good to have as backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, while digging through the settings menu of the browser, we found that there's an explicit setting for GIF animations, which is disabled by default. GIF on Android has a spotty history, but keep in mind the Desire 700 dual sim browser supports animations, as long as you enable them first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Chrome browser also comes preinstalled on the HTC Desire 700 dual sim. Its interface is easier to navigate but it doesn't offer Flash support and never will. On the up side, it can synchronize the tabs you have open in other Chrome browsers (on a computer, tablet, other phone, you name it).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Organizing is dully covered on the HTC Desire 700 dual sim. Office documents are handled through the preloaded Polaris Office app. It supports Excel, Word, PowerPoint and more and lets you view and edit files on the go. It's great to see a full Office suite when even some flagships (*cough* Galaxy S4*cough*) don't have one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested a couple of Word and Excel files and found the Desire 700 dual sim perfectly capable of handling them. There's a PDF viewer too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC even added a VPN app, KeyVPN, which you might need for your work, so it's great to have out of the box (and for free).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar on the HTC Desire 700 dual sim has five different types of view: Month, Week, Day, Agenda and Invites. You can swipe between different months/weeks/days like you would through tabs in other Sense 5 apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder. Naturally, the Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), only one of which you can sync with your computer. You can also easily show/hide the ones you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invites view only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator on board. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app comes with World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch and a Timer. The World clock is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and zoom in on it freely. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock application can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The stopwatch and timer are pretty self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tasks app is here as well. It does exactly what the name suggests and can access your Google Tasks. There is no location-based reminder support unlike with Any.DO, iOS's Reminders, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Note app is also onboard. It is somewhat similar to Samsung's S Memo - you can take various notes, add drawings, pictures and dictations. Sharing and printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Weather app is here too. It became popular years ago with its cool weather animations and widget. You can preset many cities across the globe and it uses the AccuWeather info (much like Samsung and Apple do).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has all the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no HTC Hub in the Jelly Bean version of HTC's Android implementation. This means you can't get additional HTC wallpapers, HTC lockscreens, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 700 dual sim has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire 700 dual sim has a good mix of features and tries to position itself as a low cost alternative of the One flagship, which is a good way to start. What the Desire 700 dual sim has in its favor is a 5" display of qHD resolution, two SIM card slots, bits of the One's styling, complete with the stereo speakers and the HTC Sense 5 skin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the good news end here. The choice of chipset supplier is unorthodox and, even though the Spreadtrum quad-core chipset has four Cortex-A7 1.2 GHz cores, it barely nudged past the Cortex A5's in Snapdragon 200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera department was another disappointment. It produced soft photos with lots of disturbingly high amount of purple fringing and choppy 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The asking price of ?300 doesn't seem particularly fair for the features offered, and puts the Desire 700 dual sim dangerously close to early 2013 flagships and dual-SIM devices with superior specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our look at the competition starts with the Sony Xperia C. It matches the Desire 700 on screen estate and resolution, but packs a Mediatek chipset with four 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 cores which, unlike the Desire 700, live up to their name performance-wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two SIM slots available on the Xperia C and the 8MP camera is another match. The Xperia C however brings a bigger battery and Sony's boxy design with the company's proprietary UI atop Android 4.2.2. The Xperia C will also cost you less than the Desire 700 dual sim, which could tip the scales in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia C</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a few players on the dual SIM field but the Galaxy Grand 2 stands out in terms of pricing and specs. It beats the Desire 700 dual sim on almost every count: the screen is a 5.25" unit of 720p resolution resulting in the superior 280ppi. There's Android 4.3 on top with the full-featured TouchWiz software and a much bigger battery. Finally, the price is a tad lower at ?270, which coupled with the LTE support means trouble for the HTC smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Grand 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola's Moto G is already a pretty perfect pitch of a smartphone, given its competitive price tag. Moto recently launched a dual-SIM version in certain markets, where the Desire 700 is available as well. The Moto G however carries a much lower price than the Desire 700. The Moto G Dual SIM is no slacker either, packing a quad-core 1.2 GHz processor. The un-skinned Android experience and prompt updates; a long with the smaller but much sharper 4.5" 720p screen make it a much easier choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto G Dual SIM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend G700 and the ZTE Grand S Flex are next on the list. The Huawei is also a dual-SIM device, and a 5-incher, but with superior 720p resolution. It matches the Desire 700 in terms of processing, battery and camera but lowers the price significantly. The ZTE Grand S Flex is a bit more expensive but still significantly cheaper than the HTC smartphone. It swaps the Huawei's dual-SIM support for LTE connectivity, but has a similarly spec'd 5" 720p screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Huawei Ascend G700 ? ZTE Grand S Flex</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we have a second smartphone by Sony, which makes it on the list mostly because the Desire 700 dual sim is priced so unreasonably high. For about ?330 the Sony Xperia Z delivers a nice 5" display of FullHD resolution, a 13MP camera, better build and water resistance. The processor is clearly superior too. At the Desire 700's current asking price, the difference boils down to a carrying case and a screen protector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has been through some rough times lately and one of the goals of their marketing strategy is to stay out of the low-end market. Their pricing certainly shows they mean it, but some of their products need to catch up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key selling points of the Desire 700 dual sim mean little when absurd pricing catapults it in the wrong company. The high asking price may as well be due to the fact that the Desire 700 is still fresh on the shelves and perhaps not too far away from a meaningful reduction. Until then, it would be hard to recommend this smartphone to anyone with this sort of cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unsuccessful products are either rushed and unprepared or late and not competitive enough. The Desire 700 dual sim sits somewhere in the middle. Some 100 euro less would've made it a pretty strong player. But for now it looks almost like HTC are playing too smart for their own good.</paragraph>
