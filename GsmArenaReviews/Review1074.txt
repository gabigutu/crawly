		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the industry moves forward, you no longer need to pay top dollar to find a capable smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While last year you could barely find any dual-core devices in the mid-range, you can now even treat yourself to a pair of Krait cores without breaking the bank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If getting the most bang for your buck is high on your priority list for the holiday shopping, the Acer CloudMobile S500 is one of the most interesting offering on the market right now. Offering an excellent feature set at a very attractive price point, it promises to deliver extremely solid smartphone experience while saving you some cash in the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But don't just take our word for it - take a look at its key specs yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p display, 8 MP snapper and dual-core Krait processor with a gig of RAM ? you don?t see many of those in the mid-range, let alone on a single smartphone. The Acer CloudMobile S500 is also willing to throw in a microSD card slot and Dolby Mobile audio enhancements to round up the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure enough ? this one lacks Jelly Bean at this stage, but then again, most of its competitors haven?t gone past Ice Cream Sandwich either. The tiny battery should be posing a bigger concern for potential buyers. The 1460mAh juice pack has lots of pixels to feed and we are curious how it will fare in our battery test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, there?s no such thing as a perfect smartphone, but the Acer CloudMobile S500 ticks so many of the right boxes, that it?s off to an excellent start. Let?s see if the positive impressions stand after the unboxing and hardware inspection. We start right after the jump.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 retail package is identical to those of its mid-range peers. It covers the basics but fails to add any extras. There is a comfortable headset with rather flimsy music playback controls, a two-piece charger and a USB cable. The rest is a pile of papers that you wouldn?t bother reading anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Acer CloudMobile S500 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 stands at 127 x 65.8 x 9.9 mm, which hardly makes it the most compact smartphone to pack a 4.3" display. To re-use our favorite example here - the Motorola RAZR M has the same screen but measures just 122.5 x 60.9 x 8.3 m, which means some 30% less volume. Still, it's a 4.3-inch phone, so its size is manageable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the smartphone weighs just 122g, so it's perfectly pocketable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer has been using a similar design on all of its recent smartphones and the CloudMobile is no exception. The curves top and bottom align nicely with the ones at the back panel and the overall look of the smartphone is pretty decent. It slightly reminds us of the good old Sony Ericsson Vivaz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choice of materials is decent - despite the all-plastic build, the CloudMobile S500 feels quite solid. Design-wise, we find the extra bezel below the screen somewhat unnecessary. The the CloudMobile only has on-screen keys for UI navigation, but it still has a huge chunk of a bezel at the bottom, which is somewhat annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there was no way for Acer to avoid this bezel, it should have at least stuck with hardware keys and allow you to use the full screen resolution for the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the device is covered with glass. The frame around the screen is sloped inwards and is slightly elevated so you feel when you?ve reached the edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We especially like the back, which feels similar to the Nexus 7 tablet's back panel. Thanks to the soft rubbery feel, the Acer CloudMobile S500 feels great in the hands and won?t slip easily out of grip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the 4.3? display there is the earpiece, the 720p front-facing camera, a proximity sensor and ambient light sensor for automatic brightness adjustment. Below the screen you get nothing but the Acer logo. The home, back and multitasking buttons are virtual and placed on the screen itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is a single-piece plastic with prominent tactile bumps on each end so you can easily find the + and - without looking. The sides of the phone are made of nicely rubberized plastic, which feels nicely grippy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side holds the micro USB port. Here you can also find the tiny gap where you have to insert your nail to open the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Acer CloudMobile S500 is where the 3.5 mm headphones jack lies along with the power/ screen lock button. We like its feedback and the fact that it?s slightly elevated, which makes it easier to find when you are not looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary microphone pinhole lies on the bottom of the Acer S500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel has a dotted texture surface and is the part with the most pronounced rubbery feel. The Acer logo is placed in the center and above it is the elevated, embedded 8 MP camera lens with a single LED flash. The secondary noise-suppressing microphone is placed on the left of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Near the bottom of the back panel lies the loudspeaker, under a Dolby Mobile-branded aluminum-made grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover is rather tricky at first. It feels like you?re ripping it open and that you?re bound to break something in the process. But as we found out it just feels that way, the plastic is sturdy enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the panel lies the lowly, but user- replaceable 1460 mAh li-Ion battery, the microSD card slot and the SIM slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 has a 30 hour endurance rating - if you do an hour of calling, an hour of video playback and 1 hour of browsing you'll need to recharge the phone every 30 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NFC board is stuck to the back panel.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 4.3? IPS LCD on the Acer CloudMobile S500?s front has a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels, which adds up to a density of around 340 ppi. Quite an impressive number indeed and one that can make some high end smartphones like the Galaxy S III, iPhone 5 and Lumia 920 green with envy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen produces good vibrant colors, thanks to its full RGB matrix and the IPS panel helps the impressively wide viewing angles. It?s not the brightest unit we?ve seen around the office but it?s definitely not too bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve prepared our display breakdown for you guys so you can judge the Acer CloudMobile S500?s screen on its own merits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling the Acer CloudMobile S500 is a breeze and we really enjoy the comforting feel of the rubberized back panel and side frame. Many will frown at the all-plastic construction but the smartphone is undoubtedly well made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding the device in one hand still allows you to use the screen with your thumb, if you have medium or larger hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, there?s plenty to like about the Acer CloudMobile S500 hardware. It has an interesting and easily distinguishable look and it offers some nice ergonomics.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich out of box, with some customizations thrown in by Acer. The user interface provides a fresh experience beyond vanilla ICS, especially if you've grown bored with the likes of TouchWiz or the Xperia UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we've shot the user interface on video for you to see how it's like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CloudMobile S500 comes by default with the usual five-pane homescreen configuration, but there is an option to have either 3 or 7 homescreens too. There are four docked shortcuts (two on either side of the launcher shortcut), which are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you create a folder, it will show thumbnails of the first three items inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 'Add and personalize' menu has been replaced by a simpler (and less functional) customization menu, which lets you change your wallpapers, manage your lockscreen shortcuts, adjust sound and volume settings, and add or remove homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike some of the other Android UI's, there is no way to get a glimpse of all of your homescreens on one screen. Adding shortcuts and such is done by dragging items from the apps and widgets menu onto the homescreen. Fortunately, the device remembers which page of the app/widgets menu you were on, so adding a new app shortcut or widget is not a tedious process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen features a nifty window blind-like slide to unlock animation which sets itself apart from most others we've encountered. Besides that, there are several lockscreen varieties to choose from in ICS, including Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Choosing another lockscreen does not change the options located in in the customization interface mentioned above, where the only lockscreen-related option you get is enabling or changing the app shortcuts. There are no music controls via the lockscreen either, even if you have a track playing in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ICS notification area has been changed slightly as well, and features several tabs. By default, it opens up your notifications, but also includes tabs for quick access to settings, as well as various alarms. The leftmost tab featuring a musical note icon, oddly, does not feature controls for your music. Instead, it is reserved for the FM radio app, and is only active after you launch it - it cannot be used as a shortcut to launch the app itself. Ultimately it is a very odd design decision, and not very useful at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is the same as the one found on vanilla ICS, where you can swipe applications to the left or right to remove them from memory. The app drawer also hasn't changed much. Once you go through all the pages containing apps, you will start browsing through widgets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 is powered by a Qualcomm MSM8260A chipset, which packs a dual-core 1.5GHz Krait processor, 1 GB of RAM and Adreno 225 GPU. We've seen great performance from Krait processors in the past - even in the dual-core variety - so we're eager to see how the S500 stacks up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CPU performance measured by BenchmarkPi is quite inspiring and handily beats most dual-cores out there. The result was similar to what we got from the HTC One S, which also features a dual-core 1.5GHz Krait.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Linpack, the One S was for a long time the cream of the crop when it came to dual-core performance. It seems like Acer did a better job at squeezing out every ounce of power from both cores, and manage to put up the best numbers we've seen in Linpack from a dual-core.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPU inside the Acer CloudMobile S500 did well in NenaMark 2. It doesn't do as well as some of the other devices (like the One S), but not all have to push out 720 x 1280 pixels resolution. When all's said and done, the numbers were far from pedestrian.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SunSpider JavaScript benchmark showed some good browser performance from the S500. The significant advantage we see here by the Samsung Galaxy Premier can partly be attributed to performance enhancements brought about by Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. Should the S500 receive this update, we expect this number to go up accordingly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsermark has gone through a revamp process and has released version 2.0. Unfortunately, there is no way to translate scores from previous versions, so our database for this test will be sparse while we go through the process of retesting our devices.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on the S500 is called the People app and is very similar to the stock ICS one and stores extensive contact information. It is separated into three tabs - groups, contacts, and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The groups tab lets you separate your contacts into various categories, including social networks, offline/online, and others. The favorites tab displays contacts which you have marked as important, as well as frequently dialed numbers below that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field that's always visible on the bottom left, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Facebook and Acer's own AcerCloud service, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings up shortcuts for calling or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding or editing a contact, each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), there's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the CloudMobile S500 was trouble-free. Its phone app displays your most used contacts in a tile-like view first, followed by an alphabetical list of all your contacts. It also features smart dialing, and it searches for matches in both the contacts' names and phone numbers - you can see the full list of results by hiding the keypad. Voice dialing can also be used via the microphone icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the S500 automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls, and not much else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Acer CloudMobile S500, where it scored a Below Average result. More info on our loudspeaker test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard threaded layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that as well. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles instant messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Acer CloudMobile S500 offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable - the screen is big enough to house decently sized keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It works the same as Swype, although even if you've never used Swype input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery with AcerCloud integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 comes with Acer's own Photo app, which syncs with the AcerCloud service, and automatically displays the media you have synced. It also has the ability to display media on other DLNA-connected devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select an album, images are arranged into tiled thumbnails and sorted by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing an image, you can use pinch gestures to make it bigger or smaller. There are several options for sharing as well as rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the Photo app's usefulness is fairly limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, there's also the ICS Gallery, which displays both images and video, and gives you the ability to edit images and share files. It offers more functionality than the Photo app, and renders it quite useless unless you're planning on using AcerCloud. The Gallery app can also sync automatically with your gmail account.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player doesn't support subtitles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer's video player app has good support for numerous codecs and resolutions, including 720p and 1080p. Unfortunately, there's no way to load subtitles (they won't load automatically either), and movies with the DivX codec refused to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the Movie Studio app which allows you to edit clips shot with the phone or imported. You can add music or still images to them as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, you shouldn't have much issue playing or editing videos with the S500 as long as you steer clear of DivX.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player included with the S500 provides the standard ICS functionality with no extra bells and whistles. Like the gallery, it can automatically include music stored in AcerCloud, which is useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whenever a song is playing, the album art is displayed on the careen alongside the standard music controls. You can swipe to the left or right to switch between tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer settings available as well, although accessing them can be tricky. There is no shortcut to the Dolby Mobile equalizer from the music player, and a notification shortcut only appears when you are playing a track. For all the other times when you need to access it, Dolby Mobile can be accessed from the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers the ability to adjust treble or bass settings, and set equalizer settings for both music and video. Dolby Mobile gives plenty of preset equalizers for many different genres, but there is no custom option to set your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no music controls which appear on the lockscreen while you're playing a song, but there is a "Now Playing" shortcut in the notification area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The CloudMobile S500 is equipped with an FM radio, which requires a plugged-in headset to function as an antenna. Swiping in either direction seeks the next radio station in range, while pressing the arrows on either side of the displayed station shifts in 0.1 MHz increments. There's also the ability to play the radio through the speaker, although you still need the headphones plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reserved radio shortcut in the notification area also becomes activated when you use the radio app, although you can't launch the radio from there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice clean audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile did quite well in our audio output quality test.The smartphone demonstrated some impressively clean output and garnished it with average volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When attached to an active external amplifier, the Acer CloudMobile produced achieved excellent readings all over and had no real weaknesses to its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressively, there's very little degradation when you connect a pair of headphones. The frequency response deteriorated a tiny bit, but still remained pretty good, while the stereo crosstalk spiked to average levels.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 8MP camera isn't the best<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 has an 8 megapixel auto-focus snapper and coupled with a single LED flash. It's capable of producing stills with a resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface features two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. On the left you get four shortcuts to various settings, while the still camera/camcorder toggle, the virtual shutter and a thumbnail of the last photo taken are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu key brings a couple of pages of extra settings - scenes, resolution, and geotagging among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is not the best we've seen for the class. There's a good deal of noise to deal with, while the image itself is not the sharpest, and the colors are somewhat inaccurate. The contrast ratio is good but not great. There was a good amount of adjustment made by the lens before it managed to focus, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro images came out well, with good detail overall. Unfortunately, a fair amount of noise is present in them too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard test shots from the CloudMobile S500 are in our Photo Compare Tool database. The synthetic resolution chart shows average results. There are some oversharpening halos here, and while the noise reduction has smeared the grass and gravel in the second chart, they are still recognizable. The third chart has accurate white balance, but subdued colors under artificial lighting.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 captures 1080p video at around 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder has the same interface as the still camera and most of the same settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in 3GP files with a bit rate of 12.1 Mbps and stereo AAC sound (96Kbps, 48kHz). The resolved detail is quite decent and the videos are smooth, although the same color and fidelity issues persist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this 1080p video sample we shot with the Acer CloudMobile S500:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download this untouched 1080p@30fps sample, taken straight off the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 shoots 1080p which get the job done, but aren't the best we've seen. Color reproduction is a little too intense, and you can see a pretty visible pink spot in the ISO chart. The level of detail isn't that high, either.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 has quad-band 2G and triple-band 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP on hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the EquiView app, which can be used to wirelessly transmit screen images to select projectors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock ICS browser is as good as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The stock ICS browser has a streamlined interface, incognito browsing and other cool features, and since the S500 doesn't run Jelly Bean yet, you can sideload Flash support onto it. We were able to get ?????????? videos to play without a hitch, but Flash games were a no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser UI is quite minimalistic; all you get is the URL bar with a tabs shortcut. Hitting the Menu key you get more options - Refresh, Forward, Save to bookmarks, Share page, Find on page, full settings and a couple of more - Request desktop site (no more hunting for that "Desktop" option buried at the bottom of the site) and Save for offline reading. There's also a scrollbar on the right, which makes for going up and down easy, as well as quickly zooming to the top or bottom of the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search engine to Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser borrows several features from its desktop counterpart. For example, when searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result, it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster if you do click it. You can set this feature to work over Wi-Fi only to preserve data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other trick is Incognito mode - there's no global setting, but you can open Incognito tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, the tab switching interface looks exactly like the Recent apps list. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls (available from the Labs settings) reveal five controls (New tab, Tabs, URL, Bookmarks, More) when you slide your finger in from the left or right. These really improve the browser experience. Another cool feature from Labs is Full screen, which squeezes in a little more screen real estate by hiding the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Chrome browser also comes preinstalled, and features many of the same features as the stock ICS browser described above.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 features the full version of Polaris Office 4.0 suite for viewing and editing documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Polaris Office has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable and panning is blazing fast. You can edit a wide variety of settings and documents, and there's also cloud storage integration (Dropbox, Box and Google Drive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to sync documents located on AcerCloud, you have you use the separate Docs app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries but you can't edit them on the phone; they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can enable advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms) in either portrait or landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, as well as weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player. There's no world clock, stopwatch or timer though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Recorder app lets you create voice memos that you can save and listen to later. It has the option to store recordings either in the phone memory or on a microSD card.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>You are in good hands with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 comes with a GPS receiver, which took about two minutes to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will do if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline from the menu" and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to fit New York and some surrounding area before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play offers lots of possibilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile S500 runs ICS, so it has access to most of the latest apps. The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There are usually several screenshots of the app in action, and oftentimes a demo video as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Google Play Store and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.), so if you wish you could do something more with your phone, odds are it's in the app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final Words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We first heard of the Acer CloudMobile S500 a couple of weeks before the Mobile World Congress in February. Back then it was supposed to be a cream of the crop, flagship device with a dual-core Krait chip, 720p screen and the latest Android on board - the stuff superphones were made of. But as the months passed we saw One X, Galaxy S III and Optimus G. and the CloudMobile S500 gradually began to fade into irrelevance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then Acer released the CloudMobile S500 with a lower price tag and all of a sudden everything made sense - it was relevant again. It would be a challenge to find a cheaper phone with an HD screen and Krait-powered processor contract-free. The company seems to have cut the right corners and struck a great balance between affordability and solid smartphone experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The greatest part is that our initial very positive initial impressions of the Acer CloudMobile S500 stand after we are done with the review. The battery isn't as bad as it appeared, while the chipset is speedier than its similarly spec'd rivals. It's not perfect and aftermarket support is a big unknown, but the smartphone is a very solid offering for the here and now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you'd prefer a different approach, you might want to check out some of the alternatives, that currently are on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i is close in terms of price, has an equally big screen, but of inferior resolution. The RAZR i is way more compact, though, having the so called edge-to-edge display, offers superior build materials and better battery life. It's mostly a battle of the looks and endurance of the Moto versus the processing power and screen quality of the Acer CloudMobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola RAZR i XT890</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Nexus is another smart buy, flaunting Android Jelly Bean and reasonably capable chipset. The Super AMOLED screen on its front is bigger than the one on the Acer but can't match it on brightness or pixel density. It also lacks proper expandable storage (read micro SD card slot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Nexus I9250</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we come to the HTC One S. It too is slightly more expensive than the Acer CloudMobile S500 , but has an 8 MP camera with HTC's ImageSense tech and a ceramic or anodized aluminum body to show for it. On the other hand the One lacks a microSD card or a 720p screen, so it's far less versatile than the CloudMobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you are willing to dig a little deeper into your pockets the LG-made Google Nexus 4 will reward you with Android 4.2 Jelly Bean (and speedy updates in the future), twice the Krait cores and a bigger HD display. The 16GB version of the Nexus 4 costs only a fraction more than the Acer CloudMobile S500, but as that one too lacks a memory expansion slot, you have to be sure that you can fit within that storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Nexus 4 E960</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems that this Christmas is a great time to be in the market for a smartphone. After the Nexus 4 delivered stunning performance on a mid-range price, it's now turn for the Acer CloudMobile to bring joy to the lower market segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer CloudMobile is a well-rounded package, which is hard to beat comprehensively. It delivers quite a lot for its price and if you are to get something extra by siding with one of its competitors, you'll almost certainly have to give up on something else in exchange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CloudMobile seems like Acer's greatest chance so far to make its presence on the smartphone market felt. The hardware is all there and if the company brings a Jelly Bean update quickly enough, this one might go on to achieve big things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even before that, the Acer CloudMobile is a great smartphones, the purchase of which you are unlikely to regret.</paragraph>
