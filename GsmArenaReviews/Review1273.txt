			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not the first time Sony Ericsson are trying to mix man and robot. But this time they're not simply putting the W in Android. The Live with Walkman is part of the company's ongoing effort to bring their smartphone lineup up to date. The next one due for upgrade is the Sony Ericsson W8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like its predecessor, the Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman puts the music in your pocket without scraping the cash out of it. It's more than a music player though - a 5 MP cameraphone and a Gingerbread-powered smartphone with all the right features for the money-conscious buyer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Live with Walkman has the refreshed Xperia styling of the new Minis and the Ray. It's basically the same phone as the new Xperia mini - minus the ultra-compact chassis and the Bravia screen. What you get in return is the Walkman credentials. The Live with Walkman does well to build on the X8 with a 5MP autofocus camera and HD video, a 1 GHz Snapdragon processor and bigger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the Live with Walkman at a glance, with all the likes and dislikes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman is designed for music lovers and tries to stay focused on things that matter to a presumably younger audience. To be honest, both the xLOUD audio enhancement and TrackID are available across the entire Xperia lineup, so no bonus points for the Live with Walkman.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an obvious effort though to make a familiar design more upbeat and attractive - bright color branding and flashing lights. The traditionally good social package in Sony Ericsson droids will be another plus for the younger users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, this looks like a phone with a pretty good idea of who its customers are. Hovering around the $200 mark, it is a reasonably priced package for the features offered. You could well be looking at free-on-contract deals too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not a particularly hard one to recommend but this review will hopefully help us all look at the bigger picture. Android and Walkman have been known to work - let's see about the Sony Ericsson Live.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman comes with a standard set of accessories. You get the essential USB cable and detachable charger head, a pair of comfortable earphones in matching white color and 2 gigs worth of extra storage on a MicroSD card in the phone itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A bigger memory card will certainly be in order if this Walkman phone is to be used to its full potential.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 106 x 56.5 x 14.2 mm the Live with Walkman isn't the smallest of phones but still reasonably compact and comfortable to hold. The all-plastic handset weighs a manageable 115 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The fresh and youthful Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman has the recognizable styling of the new Xperia lineup. The phone is only just on the right side of chubby, no offense meant. It's nothing that stands in the way of comfortable handling - quite the opposite - the phone virtually sticks to the palm. It's just that the Live with Walkman lacks the sharp sporty feel of the Ray and the miniature magic of the new mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our test unit looks fresh in its white paintjob. Alternatively, there?s a black color combo too. The two versions of the phone have different color accents. The headphone jack LED and the Walkman logo are orange in the white handset and flashy green on the black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman has a 3.2? HVGA (320x480) display of 16M colors. The sheet of glass above the screen stretches from the earpiece at the top to the standard set of Android controls at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not the Bravia-engine-powered Reality display of the Xperia mini. The garden variety TFT unit has good brightness and pleasing colors but poor contrast. The outdoor performance is what suffers the most. The Live with Walkman fails to match the sunlight legibility of the Xperia mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you'll find proximity sensor and the secondary VGA camera. Network video calls are not supported but the front cam will do for chats on Google Talk or Skype. There?s an ambient light sensor too (the phone has manual brightness as well). A tiny status LED is the last thing to note next to the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display users will find the Back, Home and Menu keys. The updated Xperia design has capacitive Back and Menu buttons, each side of a physical Home key. The Home button is soft but clicky, while the capacitive controls are well-defined, nicely backlit and haptic enabled. All are very comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Right side of the phone features the volume rocker and a half-press-enabled dedicated shutter key. Both controls are well defined and tactile, with nice press feedback. The half press of the camera button is quite delicate and needs some time getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing on the left side of the Live with Walkman is the MicroUSB port. Placed right in the middle, the connectivity port could get in the way if you need to use the phone while charging. On the other hand, landscape use is very comfortable (e.g. browsing or watching videos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone is where things start to get interesting. The 3.5mm headphone jack has a trim of orange plastic. It?s the light effect LED, which is one of the music player options. The dedicated Walkman button is up there too, along with the power/lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone isn't too crowded. It features the microphone pinhole and a lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside, you'll find the 5 MP camera lens with a single LED flash, an etched out Walkman logo, the usual Sony Ericsson badge and two speakers for stereo music playback. Placing the device down on its back doesn't seem to muffle the sound ? it gets amplified instead. The battery cover is all white but with matte finish for better grip and fingerprint resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals a 1200 mAh battery, the SIM compartment and a non-hot swappable microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery is quoted at 14h of talk time in 2G and about 6 and a half hours in 3G. Standby is 600h/850h in 2G and 3G respectively, with over 17 hrs of music playback. Those numbers are a bit exaggerated, of course. The barely lasted a whole day of heavy use (always connected to both the 3G and Wi-Fi networks, heavy browsing, music and video playback, and the usual imaging tests). Otherwise, we had it on stand-by for just about two days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're pleased with the handling and looks of the Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman. A neat and simple package, though not feeling cheap at all. They did well to freshen up and energize a familiar design. The phone looks cool in white, although the black combo has a charm of its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone feels solidly built and has near perfect hand fit. Just make sure the screen size works for you. Generally, it's absolutely fine for navigating the interface. It?s just the on-screen keyboard that may be a problem.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: more than one widget per screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread, with a custom skin and a nice package of apps. The corner-based homescreen of the Xperia minis makes a comeback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get five homescreen panes to fill with widgets, shortcuts or folders, and the corner drawers are visible on all screens. With a minor exception: if a widget is too big (the People widget for example) it hides the top two corners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We quite like Sony Ericsson's Overview mode on the homescreen. You pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new pane sets in with a cool transition effect to display all of your active widgets. If there is not enough space for all the widgets, they start floating on the screen overlapping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Overview mode is similar to HTC?s Leap view or what Samsung have in TouchWiz. However, widgets are not ordered in mini screens, so small that you cannot actually see what?s on each of them. Widgets are shuffled together instead so they can better use the space. They are as big as possible and thus easier to tap on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four corners can host up to four shortcuts each, as easy to assign as a simple drag-and-drop. If a corner has a single shortcut (just the dialer for example), the respective app launches automatically upon a tap. If there is more than one shortcut - the tab expands into a jog wheel so you can make your choice properly. You can't put folders there though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the main menu, you will see shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort the icons within the grid ? you can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually move the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman supports both static and live wallpapers. There are 15 static wallpapers and a single live one (Maps), but you can always get more at the Market or use a picture from your personal gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Live with Walkman has themes enabled too but the implementation is pretty basic: a theme only changes the wallpaper and the system menus. On a positive note, if you like Sony Ericsson's wave theme but you are tired of watching it in blue, now you can have it in a lot more colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're very pleased with the interface response. It's zippy throughout, probably due to the lower screen resolution (HVGA instead of WVGA or higher). And the UI is well optimized for the smallish screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A better Timescape UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Timescape brings all your communications together: an aggregate view of your SMS, MMS, email, call log, Facebook and Twitter updates. You can easily filter the contents by type and get all relevant information in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Timescape you not only see the latest activities and updates of your contacts but also share your own status, reply to received messages or return a missed call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set it as a homescreen widget too. There are free Timescape plugins on the Android Market for Sony Ericsson users. Currently, you can update your Timescape with mixi, Foursquare, Orkut, Gmail, Music and Photo extensions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman comes with a 1GHz ARMv7 processor and 512MB of RAM. That?s enough power to smoothly handle loads of apps. Gingerbread helps in this department too and HVGA resolution means the GPU has much less pixels to process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our usual set of benchmarks on the Live with Walkman. Here are the numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On Quadrant it got the respectable 1748 points, which is well over some of last year?s top droids. On Neocore it went up to 64.5 frames per second, which is a good achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AnTuTu pits the Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman against the best in class and the score of nearly 3000 points beats the likes of the Nexus S and Desire HD. Smartbench 2011 was the only mediocre score for the Live with Walkman.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numbers aside, the Live with Walkman doesn?t disappoint in terms of actual performance. It?s a very fluid and responsive smartphone and you?ll hardly find anything to complain about. The fact that in-browser Flash playback goes up to 720p trouble-free is evidence of the kind of performance to expect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Live with Walkman's visually customized phonebook can store extensive information about all your contacts. The list can be sorted by either first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts, or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If someone is added in more than one account, you can ?join? their contact info. This can be really handy as you can have Facebook, Twitter or other service details all in the same place with the regular contact?s details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled ? a tap on the contact?s photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the plus and X buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write down the name phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Personalized ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two contact search options ? a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality is good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments. We didn?t experience any reception issues either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Live with Walkman does not support smart dialing. There?s voice dialing though (the quickest way to activate it is the dedicated homescreen widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman automatically disables the touchscreen during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test. Sony Ericsson have the xLOUD audio enhancement on the Live with Walkman. A quick test shows deeper sound, but we also used our digital noise/loudness meter - xLOUD made a difference of about 5dB when you sum up the tests. It's not just a straightforward increase though - it boosts lower frequencies, while high frequencies (and high frequency ringtones) remain mostly untouched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Live with Walkman snatched a Very Good mark with xLOUD on and an Average with xLOUD off so we'd recommend leaving the setting on so you can enjoy the full potential of the Live with Walkman's stereo speakers. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of Android values simplicity in design and is very easy to use. All SMS/MMS are organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (against deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick Contacts feature only works in separate messages, not in the whole thread. You can also request delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a text is a little frustrating as the text box starts off as a single line and grows only to three lines, which makes working with longer texts harder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection is a major change in the user interface since Gingerbread - it's done by placing two large pointers either side of the marked text. You can then drag each of those easily to make the selection you need. It really doesn?t get much simpler than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there?s no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have added a Preview Pane to the generic email client. The preview pane can be expanded and collapsed, as well as thumb scrolled. The nice thing here is the pane stays exactly where you left it and can save you a few taps. You can check out our video demo to see how it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input - three virtual keyboards<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Live with Walkman offers just the default (Gingerbread) on-screen full QWERTY keyboard (portrait and landscape) and a virtual numeric pad in portrait mode only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a ?handle? attached to the text cursor ? it?s easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A tap and hold will bring up the select options ? select word and select all ? with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection. Another tap and hold brings up the copy/cut options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia mini uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn?t really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, your photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have added support for Facebook albums too. They are set apart by a small Facebook logo and when viewing individual pics from that album, you can "like" them with the thumbs up button in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player: limited codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Live with Walkman as in most of the droids out there. Fair enough, maybe a fancy UI for picking a video is not that important, playing videos is what really counts. Well, that?s another disappointment ? the video player supports only 3GP and MP4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To its credit, the Live with Walkman did play a 720p MP4 video though (it records 720p videos, so it's expected to).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can of course download a capable video player off the Android Market and make your life easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Live with Walkman is quite the looker. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums. Altough it has the Walkman branding you'll find no major differences compared to what the Xperia line of phones have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you?ll get send and delete options. There is also a dedicated search bar at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, the current album and the Infinite key, which allows you to quickly look up a song or album on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the equalizer: it?s a rich selection of presets. One or two custom slots would?ve made sense ? after all the player needs something to justify its Walkman badge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The xLOUD audio enhancement is a setting that ups the loudspeaker volume. It?s not exclusive to the Live with Walkman ? all of the Xperia smartphones have it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman-good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman lived up to its name in our traditional audio output test. It got some pretty great scores and was reasonably loud so most users will have nothing to frown at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the really impressive scores are achieved with the smartphone connected to an active external amplifier. In that case the Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman hasn't got a single weak point of its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play there's some degradation here and there, most notably with stereo crosstalk and distortion levels. Still those are no worse than average and with the other scores remaining very good, we'd give the Live with Walkman a very good mark on the second test as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial to make skipping to the next station easier. Or, you can mark some of the saved stations as favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service for song recognition is also available and works within the radio app.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera is only decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Live with Walkman offers a 5 megapixel snapper with a single LED flash. There is a handy dedicated shutter key too just like on the Xperia active and the Xperia mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the Live with Walkman's camera is quite intuitive. You have a bar with five shortcuts to popular features on the right, a bar with the latest captured images on the left and still camera/camcorder switch at the bottom. You can hide or expand both bars with swiping gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The five most used shortcuts allow you to change the capturing mode, resolution, to pick a scene, turn on flash and switch to the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon pressing the menu key (or dragging the left bar to the right side) you get some extra customizable options like focus mode, touch capture, white balance, geo tagging and image stabilization. The Live with Walkman also boasts face detection and smile shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is decent on the Live with Walkman. The produces photos have good color reproduction but the amount of captured detail isn't impressive. Detail gets smeared the further away from the center of the picture you look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Noise is very low but due to the agressive noise reduction algorithm much of the detail is lost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took some close-ups of flowers while out with the Live with Walkman. The results aren't too impressive. The phone oversaturates the colors to the point where you can't tell the petals apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, here's a panorama shot made with the Live with Walkman. Using the propriety camera option you can shoot panoramas by moving the device while it takes the pictures - this is called Sweep Panorama. Here is the result of one of our attemprs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can clearly see from the comparison tool that the shots are pretty much identical with mini pro and the mini's samples and fall behind other 5 megapixel snappers.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording only in name<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HD video recording is turning as a hot feature recently and the Live with Walkman is doing relatively well with the framerate. It?s 30fps and quite steady too. As some previous Sony Ericsson devices, the Live also captures few duplicated frames, but not that much to ruin the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Live with Walkman camcorder supports continuous autofocus. Its approach is the same as on the Xperia X10, Arc, Neo, etc: it may take a few seconds to refocus after you reframe instead of fast and constant re-focusing. It?s certainly the approach we prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly, the video quality is on par with the mini pro. The videos run smooth, but the captured detail is low and there's a pinkish spot in the center. On the positive side, the color rendering is spot on. The HD samples look good on the small display, but they are not that great on a bigger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best we can say for the quality of the 720p videos capture with the Live with Walkman is that they are smooth. Detail is very low and the elements in the video look soft focused and not sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the  untouched 720p sample that we captured with the Live with Walkman.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We added the Live with Walkman samples to our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with the other 720p mobile camcorders we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of fine detail is evident when compared to competing products plus there's a pinkish spot in the center of the frame, although it's not that intrusive as it was on the mini pro.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman has quad-band (850/900/1800/1900) GSM network support. There?s dual-band 900/2100 and tri-band 850/1900/2100 3G too, depending on region. You can count on up to 7.2 Mbps of download speed. Wi-Fi covers the b/g/n standards and there is Wi-Fi hotspot functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP and standard microUSB are also on the list. Like all recent Xperia smartphones, the Live with Walkman supports USB on the go via a LiveDock, which is sold separately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser does Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Android 2.3 Gingerbread and the Adobe Flash 10.3 support, the Live with Walkman?s web browser does a great job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty light at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in or pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports text reflow, but it works only with double tap ? a moment after setting the zoom level just double tap on the display and the columns of text will align to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.2? HVGA screen may sound too small, but it is more than enough and you have all the screen estate for actual content. The Xperia mini's browser supports double tap and pinch zooming, along with the dedicated virtual zoom buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser has full Flash support with the Adobe Flash 10.3 player (available for free at the Market). YouTube videos at 360p played quite smoothly but you'll have no problems with 720p too, once the video has loaded. Playing Kongregate Flash games is no problem on the Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high-quality videos on YouTube and other Flash video services had some dropped frames, but the overall Flash performance turned out pretty decent. The YouTube app is still there though, just in case.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS and Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Live with Walkman has a GPS receiver and A-GPS support. It managed to lock onto satellite signal in less than 2 minutes with A-GPS turned off. With A-GPS on, which involves some network data, satellite lock took less than a minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the main application and its Street View mode is probably the best part of the deal in places where turn-by-turn voice navigation isn?t yet offered. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. Zoom is supported through pinch and double tap gestures. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street View is great for virtual tours of places you want to visit. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. Zoom is supported through pinch and double tap gestures. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the Live with Walkman with Maps 5 out of the box, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without a connection though. There are also 3D buildings (where available), two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on your region you may get the Live with Walkman comes with Wisepilot navigation pre-installed, but you'll have to pay for it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman comes with a solid set of organizer apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Notes application as well as Reminders. Document viewing is enabled, courtesy of the OfficeSuite. Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF are supported, including the Office 2007 versions. Editing will cost you around $10 at the Android market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual suspects are there too: an Alarm clock, calculator, calendar - all basically unchanged from previous Sony Ericsson droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app has desk clock and night mode enabled. It dims the display so that it won't bother you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is a music recognition service that was pioneered by Sony Ericsson on their Walkman feature phones. Open the app, record some of the music you?re listening to and hope that the Gracenote servers will find the song in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook app for Android is preinstalled and has all the functionality you need: photo uploads, comments, news feeds, groups and events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chances are, though, you won?t use it all that much given the deep Facebook integration on the phone. Your Facebook contacts are in the phonebook while Albums are in the gallery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The new Android Market is a looker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman has the latest version of the Android Market, featuring a facelift with a bit of WP7 styling. New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor?s Choice and a dedicated Sony Ericsson tab, courtesy of the maker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon launch of the Market app you?re greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free, Trending (the ones with growing popularity) and Sony Ericsson.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson pane is the place to get the company optimized apps. It?s something along the lines of the HTC Likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn?t quite like about the new Android Market layout is that you?ll be forced to do a lot of scrolling if you want to go to a specific category and there isn?t a listed or tabbed menu for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson's own store called PlayNow is also on board. There you can get a lot of free things for your phone - wallpapers, some games and apps or even music tracks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Live with Walkman will take over from the Sony Ericsson W8. It?s nothing out of the natural order of things. A neat and straightforward upgrade to 5MP autofocus, HD video, a 1GHz processor and a bigger screen. This is an upgrade that makes sense in the context of the Xperia lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes even more sense in the light of a recent announcement about Sony Ericsson eyeing a complete shift to smartphones. The refreshed Xperia lineup will be a solid foundation to build on. But they need to fill some blanks between the two Arcs and the two minis. That?s where phones like the Live with Walkman and the Xperia Active come in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way we see it, the Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman is at the bottom of the Xperia food chain. No shame in that: it?s the phone with the youngest demographics and one that seems to know its target audience well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems Sony Ericsson know the competition well too. The Live with Walkman has got a welcome boost in processing power, as it?s preparing to tackle Nokia?s recent 1GHz smartphones. We don?t mean any Windows Phone devices ? the Walkman droid will surely be out of its depth. It?s the likes of the Nokia 500 and the Nokia 600 that it will try to outsmart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 500 ? Nokia 600</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There will be other droids to keep an eye on too and the Wildfire S is among the likeliest contenders. It matches the Live with Walkman in terms of imaging and display, and adds a bit of metal on the body. It?s been around for a while now and doesn?t cost too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Wildfire S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We think the Walkman droid looks the part ? not too fancy but young and fresh, affordable without feeling cheap. The same goes for the internals ? this is the only one in the new Sony Ericsson lineup without a Bravia screen. The rest of the specs are more than decent though ? the phone has plenty of processing power, above average still camera and camcorder and a solid set of apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman branding does seem a bit of a gimmick to be honest. The phone?s Walkman player has nothing more to offer than the regular music player in other Xperia smartphones. They didn?t even bother include a custom equalizer. The xLOUD audio setting and Track ID are available across the company?s portfolio. At least, the Walkman button and light effects are something to show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Walkman branding has little to do with the actual performance. It?s a status symbol though ? something for the audience to identify with. Plus, the Live with Walkman can take comfort in the fact that it doesn?t do things worse than an Xperia Arc. This can be bad, can it? And we don?t only mean the music player ? most of the features are there and the solid social network integration is of particular relevance.</paragraph>
