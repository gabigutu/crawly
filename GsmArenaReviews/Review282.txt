			<paragraph>The world's second largest phone manufacturer Samsung made sure it doesn't get left out of the spotlight at the World Mobile Congress. In Barcelona the South Korea-based company announced a hefty number of new handsets. Samsung also took the chance to show a few unreleased devices to the public.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G810</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most prominent announcement is undoubtedly the Samsung G810. The nice 2.6" display and 5 megapixel camera are just the icing of the cake. The phone also features xenon flash and 3x optical zooming capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rich connectivity options of Samsung G810 include 3G with HSDPA support, EDGE, Bluetooth v2.0 (A2DP also included), USB v2.0 and even a 3.5mm audio jack. Add Wi-Fi and the GPS for navigation and geo-tagging and you get a very tempting gadget indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part is that - unlike its predecessor, Samsung G800 - the G810 is a Symbian smartphone, running on the S60 user interface - much like Nokia N95.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find out more about our hands-on experience with the Samsung G810 here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung F480</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next Samsung's booth hosted the full-touch UI-based Samsung F480. The 2.8" 262K color display of Samsung F480 is really one of great quality. The phone also features a 5 megapixel auto focus camera, 3G with HSDPA and tri-band GSM network coverage. All that functionality is packed in the very small dimensions of 95.9 x 55 x 11.5 mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the best part about Samsung F480 is not functionality. Instead, the strength of this little baby lies in the great user interface, which is one of the best Samsung efforts so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the eye-catching graphics, semi transparent overlays and the rich animations, Samsung F480 offers the so called desktop widgets. Those are info applications that reside on your desktop. They are fully configurable, and movable around the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation solution used at the bottom of the screen is also very interesting and pleasant to work with. It is very responsive and we really liked it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find out more about our hands-on experience with the Samsung F480 here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U900 Soul</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final highlight of today's presentation is a handset Samsung are in fact putting up front. It's their latest Ultra series mobile - the largely advertised Samsung U900 Soul. This year Samsung are presenting only one Ultra device - they claim it's the quintessential mobile device that doesn't need to mix with any Ultra peers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U900 Soul features a 5 megapixel camera and a rather rare navigation solution - the touch-sensitive pad. The pad itself is well implemented - it offers great reaction, haptic feedback and some nice animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U900 Soul is equipped with a 2.2" 16M color display with QVGA resolution, which as most of the latest Samsung displays is great in terms of picture quality. 3G with HSDPA is also available, along with a whole bunch of high-end features. The build quality is excellent.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Samsung gracefully allowed us some private time with the latest and greatest of their mobiles announced here at the Mobile World Congress 2008.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, it's the Samsung G810 - the 5 megapixel Symbian slider that's in for a match with the almighty Nokia N95. It has the GPS, it has the Wi-Fi, and it's got the guts to take on the champion with 3x optical zoom and xenon flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G810 with its splendid brushed metal finish certainly looks the part. It leaves the impression of an expensive and luxurious device (which it is in fact).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel has four soft keys and a D-pad - all unmarked to keep the minimalist looks in tact. The upper couple are the context keys. The lower row is another story. The lower left button is the Symbian key that opens the main menu. Upon a press and hold it activates the Task manager (or Task switcher), which lists all the running applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The red and green receiver keys are nowhere to be seen on the front panel: they were dismissed to the lower deck and share beds with the alphanumeric keys. That's an understandable solution, which however doesn't prove that convenient. In fact, we couldn't help getting annoyed with it during the time we had with the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of Samsung G810 is better than the ones of F480 and U900 under direct sunlight. Yet, none of the trio is capable of surpassing the Nokia achievements in this area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hurried up to take some camera samples - you will see that it's a really cloudy Barcelona day. The camera interface of Samsung G810 is the same as the one of its predecessor G800 - which is quite a feat since the G800 doesn't run on the same operating system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of the G810 smartphone makes use of the built-in GPS receiver to geotag your photos, so you can use them in geotag-enabled blogs and galleries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All images have been downsampled to 1024 x 768 pixels with no further corrections made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 19 Feb: We have added full resolution samples along with these downsampled images. The full samples clearly show the loss in quality at the longest telephoto position (3x zoom):</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took a video with the Samsung G810 - we thought you guys would like it. The maximum video resolution of Samsung G810 is VGA. The framerate at this resolution is 22 fps - not exactly a killer achievement. Nokia N95 is still unchallenged in this respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 19 Feb: Here is the Samsung G810 sample camera video. The traffic conscious users should bear in mind that it's about 5MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are our first impressions of Samsung G810 - enjoy our photos and remember we'll be posting full-res images in a few days when the fever of the new announcements has hopefully subsided and our servers are feeling a little better.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Spending some time alone with a bunch of newly announced handsets is probably not everyone's favorite pastime, but we happen to be the other type - we absolutely love it. You can imagine how we felt when Samsung allowed us to skip bail with three of their precious debutants.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung U900 Soul<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We already told you about the Samsung G810, now it's time for the rest of the gang - the Samsung F480 and Samsung U900 Soul.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U900 Soul is the most pushed forward device of them all. With brushed metallic looks, 5 megapixel camera and a color OLED touchpad, it certainly scores tech points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were pleased with its performance. Seems like the U900 uses a new Samsung feature phone interface, as it's totally skinnable through themes - by the way Samsung have done a great job with the default ones - creating themes of your own is also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The highlight of Samsung U900 Soul is the color touchpad it uses instead of a D-pad. It works great with really fast reaction and good haptic feedback. It even reacts to press-and-hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of U900 Soul is usual Samsung - great colors and contrast indoors and poor performance under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a hunch that we want to share with you - we think the U900 uses the same hardware platform as Samsung G600. There's nothing wrong with it - the G600 has turned into a bestseller thanks to its moderate price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel autofocus camera of the U900 also got us intrigued. So, we wasted no time and fired it up. Check out the results downsampled to 1024x768. We will be posting the full resolution images when the Mobile World Congress wraps up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All images have been downsampled to 1024 x 768 pixels with no further corrections made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 19 Feb: We have added full resolution samples along with these downsampled images:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung U900 walkthrough video</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took some Samsung U900 demo videos for you to enjoy:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung F480<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung F480 was the other mobile that we managed to sneak into daylight. It was worth it, we may add. We really enjoyed that one too. In fact, we'll go as far as saying that we liked it even better than the U900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung F480 is Armani revamped - this time without the fashion ring though. Standing at only 11.9 mm, the F480 has a spanking new Samsung full touch UI. We already told you a little bit about it, but seeing it for real does make a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Samsung UI has nice colorful icons that we would like to see more of - we are already getting sick of black-and-white touch phones. The addition of widgets is another thing that easily impresses on a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you are on the home screen, pressing on the lower left angle brings out the Widgets bar. Then you simply drag some of them on the display. Once you are done with the widgets, you can dispose of them in much the same way - drag them back to the Widgets bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other novel thing about the new Samsung UI is that most of the actions are presented with animations, so it's eye-candy all over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Samsung UI can barely be seen under direct sunlight: the display is absolutely illegible in such conditions. The inevitable greasy smudges all over the touchscreen display make matters even worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't take sample images with the 5 megapixel camera, since the battery was running out but we did notice that the camera has a brand new interface too. It's probably safe to say that this camera interface is probably the best among all full touchscreen feature phones we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that's about it on our up-close-and-personal with Samsung's latest offerings. Remember that we will be posting full-res images in the days to come when the fever of the new announcements has hopefully subsided and our servers have started to heal.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Samsung P960</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung P960 is a stylish multimedia phone in a slider form factor. The major highlight of P960 is the DVB-H support with a TV-like pictogram on one of the shortcut keys next to the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung F400</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung F400 is definitely a music-centered phone, which partially replicates the design of the music smartphone Samsung i450. It's a dual slider with an external speaker of very sleek exterior and ample D-pad. The sound quality is entrutsed to the Bang &amp; Olufsen ICEamp technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L770</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L770 is a sleek slider (what else, we're talking Samsung) featuring HSDPA and mobile blogging. The handset offers a 2.1" QVGA display, audio and video player, 2 megapixel camera and an FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L320</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L320 offers rounded clamshell design and is supposed to come as a successor of the rather popular Samsung E570. It comes with a 1.9" TFT LCD main display with a 176 x 220 resolution and an external OLED 176 x 16 pixel one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung J700</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar in shape and design to L770 but obviously inferior in functions, Samsung J700 will cater to the style sensitive budget-minded users. The modest, yet attractive, slider offers a notably smaller 2" display with 128 x 160 pixel resolution and 1.3 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung E251</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung E251 is a low-end slider with dedicated music player control, FM radio and changeable graphic UI. The tri-band handset features a 2" display with a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels and a VGA camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L310</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L310 is a black-and-gold clamshell. It has a rather uncommon S-shaped hinge that should be able to make it stand out in a crowd. It has a number of Female applications - Shopping list, Fragrance type and Calories consumption. The phone sports a 1.8" TFT display with a resolution of 176 x 220 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung J150</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The low-end announcement Samsung J150 is the other bar-shaped phone in the bunch. This tri-band handset offers the basic 1.9" 65K-color display and a 1.3 megapixel snapper. EDGE and FM radio are more than welcome in this entry-level offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung I200</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting entry level smartphone, Samsung I200 candybar is the only business novelty. Running on Windows Mobile 6 Standard, this down-to-earth smarty sports a 2.3" QVGA display and a 2 megapixel CMOS shooter. The indisputable highlights of the business-minded device are HSDPA and the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung F330</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung F330 is equipped with a 256K color TFT display with QVGA resolution. The device incorporates a dedicated Bang &amp; Olufsen audio chip, dedicated music keys and an FM radio to add to its musical image. Samsung F330 also has a 2 megapixel built-in camera with autofocus.</paragraph>
