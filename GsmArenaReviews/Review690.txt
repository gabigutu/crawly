			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BLU may be a comparatively small operation, but it brought out a lot more phones to CES 2015 than most of the big players. They range from supremely thin to super-juiced, but none of them go north of the $200 mark off contract.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company is headquartered in Miami, Florida and instead of manufacturing its own devices it puts its own spin on existing products and brings them to the US market. Still, considering how difficult it can be to import a phone from a little-known maker in Southern Asia, the BLUs may as well be original devices for their market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, they are priced on par with the Moto G or below, but bring some unique features. The BLU Vivo Air is a thin, light sliver of aluminum-magnesium alloy. It measures just 5.1mm thick and weighs less than 100g, while packing a Super AMOLED display and an octa-core processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BLU Studio Energy solves a different problem - the energy crisis of a battery running low. With a 5,000mAh capacity, the phone does not need after-market battery packs. In fact, it can replace one by charging other gadgets. And if it keeps all its juice to itself, it can last over 50 hours of talking on its two SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the BLU Life One and Life One XL. They share their design and hardware, differing mainly on screen size - 5" and 5.5" respectively. These two bring LTE connectivity and 64-bit processors to the table, topping the current iteration of Moto G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BLU Studio X and Studio XL serve as lower-cost alternatives to the Life One duo. They drop the LTE and the price and gain a second SIM slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Studio G is cheaper still and sets its sights on the likes of the Microsoft Lumia 535. All three Studio phones along with the Life One duo will be updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop (they'll launch with 4.4 KitKat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also got to meet the BLU Studio C and C Mini, which were announced a while back. The Studio C Mini is a slightly more compact alternative to the Studio G, while the Studio C is closer to the Studio X.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BLU Vivo Air<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On paper the BLU Vivo Air is one of the best phones ever made - it barely measures 5.1mm thick, it weighs less than 100g, has a Super AMOLED display and is powered by an octa-core processor. It's going on sale in a week or so and will cost you just $200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Too good to be believed? Well, credit where credit is due, the aluminum-magnesium alloy provides a premium feel and rigidity to the device, while Gorilla Glass 3 guards both the front and the back. It's a beautifully designed device too, minimalist but minimalism done right. And you can always impress people by letting them handle it, it takes a while to get used to how thin and light it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is 4.8" big with 720p resolution - that's 306ppi, basically what the Galaxy S III had. It's priced on par with the Moto G and the extra contrast and punchier colors tip the scales in BLU Vivo Air's favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has twice as many CPU cores to boot - part of a MediaTek chipset. The RAM is limited to 1GB, matching the Motorola, and the software is a step behind. It's customized Android 4.4 KitKat with no official plans to update yet. The software runs fluidly, though heavy multitasking is not in its wheelhouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike some similarly priced BLUs (more on them in a minute), the Vivo Air lacks LTE connectivity. The 2,100mAh battery is smaller than what some Android are packing, but it's more than an iPhone 6 has (actual battery life is another matter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the back is good for 8MP stills and 1080p video, while the front one takes 5MP selfies. The storage is 16GB and there's no card slot so that's all you're getting. That was one iPhone "feature" we wish the Vivo Air did not have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And no, you're not having a deja vu, this is the same hardware as the Gionee Elife S5.1.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>BLU Studio Energy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We can't hold the 2,100mAh battery against the Vivo Play, it's all about looks. The BLU Studio Energy is not as vain and packs a massive 5,000mAh battery. Some battery packs come with this much - or less - and the Energy can indeed be used to charge other gadgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is not thick either, at 10.4mm it's double the thickness of Air, but it's quite usable. It's a better solution that sticking an aftermarket battery case on your phone. One downside is that it's a hefty device, weighing in at 180g. Again, better than what you get with 3rd party packs but more than most 5" phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is an IPS LCD, but other than that, it's 5" 720p with Gorilla Glass 3, same as the Vivo Air. The BLU Studio Energy is powered by a weaker chipset - or should we say less power-hungry - than the Air and runs Android 4.4 KitKat with dubious update prospects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upside is that talk time is rated at 52 hours and there are two SIM cards. If you need to make a lot of calls and can't stay long near a wall socket, the Studio Energy is the one to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design is not a head-turner but isn't bad either and there's an 8MP/1080p camera and 3G connectivity (21Mbps), a memory card slot too. At $180, the BLU Studio Energy makes a good backup phone, unless its weight is not an issue, then it's a good mid-range daily driver too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BLU Life One and Life One XL<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Budget devices aren't the core market driver in the US where BLU operates, carrier subsidies often mask the true cost of a device. The country has one of the most developed LTE networks though (carries certainly push it as a must-have).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BLU Life One and Life One XL duo skips MediaTek for Qualcomm and its Snapdragon 410 chipset enables 150Mbps downlink speeds and faster 42Mbps 3G at the same $180/$200 price tag, depending on the size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One Life has a 5" screen while the XL goes up to 5.5", both 720p IPS LCDs and Gorilla Glass 3 protection. 720p is a bit of a stretch on 5.5" but is passable for a mid-ranger. That said, the anodized aluminum frame makes the Life duo feel more premium than its price tag suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's another perk of the Snapdragon chipset, the Life One and Life One XL may be running 4.4 KitKat now but an Android Lollipop update is in the cards. A 13MP/1080p camera plus a microSD card slot are two more features that this duo has on the Vivo Air. You'll need the card slot sooner rather than later since there's only 8GB of built-in storage to start you off. At least BLU kept the 5MP selfie camera, which is another selling point in the US.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two One Life come in a special color option called Sandstone Gray, basically the same material that covers the OnePlus One. We're not the biggest fans of it, but it has its proponents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One potential weak point for the two is battery life. The 5" model has a 2,420mAh battery, barely bigger than Vivo Life's battery. It measures 7.5mm thick, which isn't bad but should have been enough for a bigger capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Life One XL does even worse in the battery capacity/phone size chart with its 2,820mAh battery and 8.3mm thickness (in addition to being taller and wider).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BLU Studio X and Studio X Plus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While quite cheap, the Life One duo can be outside your price range. Then there's the BLU Studio X and Studio X Plus. Those two also come in 5" and 5.5" options, but go back to a MediaTek chipset and 3G connectivity in return for lower price tags - $130 and $150 respectively. Internet speeds may top out at 21Mbps, but the Studios bring a second SIM slot over the Life Ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the chipset change doesn't stop the duo from expecting an update to Android 5.0 Lollipop. Makes you wonder why the fancier Vivo Air is getting left out. Anyway, the rest of the Studio X specs are similar if slightly downgraded to the Life One. This includes a 720p IPS display, an 8MP/1080p main camera and 2MP selfie camera, thicker bodies (10.5-10.6mm) and no Sandstone color option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The batteries also take a hit and are 2,100mAh for the 5" model and 2,600mAh for the 5.5" model. That's despite being thicker than their Life One counterparts. Honestly, we're not completely sold on the $50/$30 saving considering the BLU Studio X and Studio X Plus downgrades are not trivial.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BLU Studio G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the US market is not very budget-focused, the BLU Studio G slips under the $100 line for those who never splurge on a smartphone. Its price point leads to some heavy cuts to functionality, but a future Android 5.0 Lollipop update and 5MP/720p camera put it in good standing against the likes of the Microsoft Lumia 535.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two have similar screens and chipsets - a 5" 480 x 854px (196ppi) and a quad-core Cortex-A7 with 512MB RAM for the Studio G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Admittedly, Windows Phone runs better on this hardware than Android does and it doesn't help that there's only 4GB of built-in storage. Those 720p videos are going to fill up the storage quick, so you absolutely need to pay extra for a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BLU Studio G is a dual-SIM phone, so it can make a cheapo travel phone with a local SIM next to your regular card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BLU Studio C HD and Studio C Mini<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A more compact alternative is the BLU Studio C Mini - it has a 4.7" IPS screen with 480 x 800px resolution and is a dual-SIM like the Studio G. This one runs Android 4.4 KitKat and there's no word on a Lollipop update. Currently, the Studio C Mini is $95 on Amazon, so saving a few millimeters here and there may be hard to justify.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BLU Studio C HD has a much sharper screen - 5" big and with 720p resolution. It also has 1GB of RAM. We know KitKat (and Lollipop too) are optimized to run on 512MB, but meeting the minimum requirement doesn't mean it runs great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All BLU Studio handsets come in a variety of bright colors, from the low-end G and C to the higher-up Studio X.</paragraph>
