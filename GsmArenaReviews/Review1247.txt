			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When Windows Phone launched a year ago, we were excited to first see it on the Super AMOLED screen of the Samsung Omnia 7. Twelve months or so later, Samsung are sort of in power-saving mode in the joint venture with Microsoft. Their Omnia W isn?t drawing all attention to itself by blowing the numbers out of proportion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia W has shed weight and lost some of its predecessor?s screen estate. What you get in return is an upgraded processor and double the data speeds. The display technology, camera sensor and the general feel haven't changed much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, yes, some would call it a half-hearted effort. Or maybe, Samsung are simply waiting for the dust to settle from Nokia?s grand entry into Windows Phone. Obviously, they didn?t want ? or need ? a European flagship along the lines of their US-based Focus S with AT&amp;T. With a single Windows-phone handset on the Old Continent, it may?ve made sense to focus on the midrange instead of making another flagship without a fleet. Bottom line, as long as we remember that it?s not an upgrade of the original Omnia 7, the Omnia W is an easy phone to live with, for all its strengths and shortcomings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia W should ring a bell to those of you who keep an eye on the US phone market. We recently reviewed the Samsung Focus Flash, which is virtually the same package, exclusive to AT&amp;T. We liked the well-built, properly powered and reasonably priced Focus Flash and we guess the Omnia W can count on a warm welcome too by users who don?t want to spend over the odds on a decent smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>People who are willing to consider Windows Phone should be well familiar by now with the platform?s limitations. The Omnia W shares the same disadvantages as its main competitors but tries to at least partially make up for them with premium build and some custom additions to what?s otherwise a standard package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some may be quick to slam the Samsung Omnia W over its seeming lack of innovation. There?s little really to set it apart from the year-old Omnia 7. The smaller display looks puzzling perhaps against Android?s march towards bigger and bigger screens ? for which Samsung are in no small part responsible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll say it again though - the Omnia W is not for upgraders to consider. It?s called upon to carve a new niche for Samsung in the midrange. How successful it will be depends on the competition too. For the time being, it?s the HTC Radar and the Nokia Lumia 800 that the Omnia W will have to face. The midrange is a relatively new territory for Windows Phone and it?s getting busier as we speak.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stay with us as we try to find out if the Omnia W has what it takes to make it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Omnia W's retail box adds no bling to the package. You get the standard issue MicroUSB cable and charging adapter, a dedicated 3.5mm headset and the phone itself. A memory card is omitted for obvious reasons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Omnia W 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia W is a very compact phone, with solid, professional looks. Its exact measurements are 115.6 x 58.8 mm and at 10.9 mm it is reasonably slim too. The weight has been reduced compared to the Omnia 7 by nearly 23 g to the svelte 115.3 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia W bets on clean design and solid build. There is a hint of the original Omnia 7 styling in the angular front and backward receding edges. The handset does well to keep a neutral professional appearance while setting itself apart from the slew of curvy Samsung droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia W fits comfortably in the hand and feels solid but not too heavy. The finish mixes quality plastic and a bit of metal. Overall, it's a subtly elegant, grown-up design that will appeal to business users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although not the full 4" of its predecessor, the Omnia W's 3.7" screen is a definite advantage over some phones by the competition. The display has WVGA (480 x 800) resolution and Super AMOLED quality, meaning great contrast, deep blacks, and commendable outdoor performance. The PenTile matrix is not such a big deal this time around. On a 3.7" WVGA screen it's not as unpleasantly visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the display chart for comparison's sake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display are the proximity sensor to disable the screen during calls, along with an ambient light sensor for auto brightness and a secondary VGA video camera. WP7 doesn't natively allow video calls but Samsung have found a workaround so videocalls are possible on this one. Also, the popular cross-platform app Tango has recently been made available for Windows Phone too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is a hardware Home button, set within its own metal frame, and two capacitive controls: Back and Search. A long press of the back key launches the task switcher as usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the Samsung Omnia W there's a Power/Lock button placed near the top and a soft and responsive shutter key with distinct half press for locking focus. The camera button overrides the screen lock to launch the camera in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is the only control on the left side of the Omnia W. Pressing the volume keys anywhere in the interface - including the lockscreen! - will open a small pull-down menu with basic music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the device there's only a 3.5 mm headphones jack. The bundled earphones are nice but you can go with just about every set available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only microphone on the Omnia W is located at the bottom along with the microUSB port for charging and PC connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 MP camera lens is located at the back of the device along with a single LED flash and the loudspeaker grill. The back panel has a brushed aluminum inset. At first you might be miffed as to how to remove the cover but once you realize the panel has more to it that the aluminum plate you'll be just fine. The entire back piece is a battery cover and there's a small groove at the bottom left to put a finger a pry it open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery, which is quoted at 370h of stand-by and 7h of talk time. The Omnia W does well enough in real life too. We could usually count on two straight days with the habitual serving of browsing over Wi-Fi, a couple of hours of video playback and the usual amount of stills and videos. AMOLED is a power-efficient screen technology and the single core architecture isn't a battery drainer either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia W is a nice phone to handle and we appreciate its understated elegance. It falls in the right niche, size-wise, to be a crowd pleaser. The 3.7" screen is perhaps the best fit considering that Windows Phone offers WVGA only resolution. It's a Super AMOLED too - the right kind of screen to enjoy the stylish Metro UI on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of design, the Omnia W does well to distance itself from the countless carbon copy Droids that Samsung have in the midrange. And by the way, a distinct personality is a must for Windows Phone 7 handsets, which are hard to tell apart on the inside.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone Mango behind the wheel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia W runs Windows Phone Mango - the proverbial puberty of an OS that feels more mature now but not quite there yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a user interface demonstration on the Samsung Omnia W.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pushing the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. The background of the lock screen can be changed from either the settings menu or the picture gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device and reveals the live-tile Metro user interface. It's a very stylish vertical grid of Live tiles that can be rearranged as you like. You can place almost anything in the grid by selecting the Pin to start option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a clean and simple interface. The Live tiles display information such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more, all without the need to open up any of the respective applications. The Pictures tile shows an animated slideshow of your images. The Group tile lists friend updates. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts. But that?s oversimplifying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A swipe to the left on the main homescreen opens up the application list or main menu. It offers a virtual Search button, which makes finding apps easier for those with many apps installed. Alternatively, you can just swipe the screen up and down to find what you're looking for. Tapping and holding on any of the apps lets you pin the selected item to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To open up the task manager on Windows Phone you have to hold the back button. Currently the WP7 task manager is nothing more than an app switcher displaying all of your currently opened apps. Visually it looks similar to that of Symbian or WebOS: thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right. You can swipe through them and pick whichever you're looking for. You can't directly close apps but by opening an app and then hitting the back button you'll affectively achieve just that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are always around 5-6 recent apps in the app switcher. Opening new ones clears out the old, so you'll practically never find yourself in a situation where you'll need to scroll through pages to find your desired app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like on iOS some apps have multitasking support and other don't, meaning that if an app supports it, once reopened it will continue from where you've paused it. If it doesn't support multitasking it will restart or reset itself and start from the beginning. Many people dislike this way of doing things but the main focus of the method is improved battery life and UI performance, which seems logical on an OS that supports single core chips only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking can be disabled from the settings to save battery. There you'll also find a list of all installed apps that support multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu reveals two sets of options - system and applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Applications settings enables you to configure individual settings for each app installed on the device - the People hub, Phone, Maps and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can't set wallpapers on Windows Phone the only visual setting that is configurable is the color theme of your UI. There are around 7 preloaded colors and two themes - dark and light. Some manufacturers have created their own theme, like the HTC green for example. We advise to keep the theme dark as it does provide better battery life due to the fact that Super AMOLED's don't require battery juice to display blacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate a text, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too (*cough*Android*cough*) but voice commands via Siri is a big bragging right of iOS (and a loudly touted one at that), so WP7.5 can brag about them too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub as a phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People hub on Windows Phone acts as a one stop shop for your contacts and social networks, like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. You have a scrollable list of all your contacts as well as a dedicated grid of letters for quick jump to any of your contacts. The What's new tab that aggregates status updates from all contacts and the Recent tab lists only recently viewed contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact's profile, you get everything from call, text, send email, write on wall, mention on Twitter and so on. The contact photo, along with its latest status update is visible on top. You also get specific contact's Facebook albums if you've linked it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting addition is the new History tab. The complete history of exchange with a contact is in one place listed by day. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features of the hub is Groups, a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Adding contacts to any group, renaming a group and so forth is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations (there's more location goodness coming on later). You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People hub is present in the Phone app too. It takes the form of a contacts tab but only instead of contacts, you have people with profiles ? a term taken right out of social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends ? everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and they can be displayed as ?First Last? or ?Last, First? (the two settings are separate), you can also include or exclude Facebook friends, import only Facebook contacts that have a phone number and add several accounts to sync with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side shows only new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recently called contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact?s profile shows the contact photo. Below that there are actions ? ?call mobile?, ?text mobile?, ?write on wall?, ?view website? and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like with most midrange to high end Samsung phones the in-call quality and signal reception on the Omnia W were great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets ? a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contactacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Focus S did well in recognizing our commands, though it did have issues separating the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name "Mandark".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist ? it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What?s missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone ? a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can always exit to the homescreen to open an app, your contacts or anything else you might need. To get back to the call just selected the call notification at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an incoming call, the contact?s photo will appear full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note ? status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We performed our traditional loudspeaker test on the Samsung Omnia W and it got an Average mark. We suggest using louder ringtones that emphasize vocals the most with the Omnia W. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging is a strong side in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech balloons and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are placed only when the conversation moves to a different platform so it's not cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which platform to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't attach anything to Facebook messages, you'll need to use MMS for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the new OS (that is dependent on the carrier and your plan). It works as you would expect, by letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email integration is a corner stone of any smartphone OS out there. Windows Phone doesn't lag behind here either. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages - those include the most commonly used such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It?s the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing an email is pretty straight-forward - it displays the content of the email and atop it the subject and sender of the mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating a message is very simple too - just starting typing a contact's name and you'll get an automated suggestion box with names and emails. Type away and send your message, that's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation.You can also mark individual emails, make them read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to - there's no double tapping here. Hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone constitutes of the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes - that's it. The layout remains the same on all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also choose from a variety of foreign (other than English that is) languages and choose to reset suggestions in case you've overwrited a word you shouldn't have.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-res Picture tile is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub is among the most visually attractive in Windows Phone's arsenal and is dense with animations, transitions and more. It's the place where all of your pictures are stored, no matter if they are uploaded via Zune, downloaded from Facebook or made with the phone's camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as a background for the hub or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. New apps get integrated into the Pictures hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Pictures hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You still can't assign individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends or closed ones so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Pictures hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll unifies your entire collection of photos and videos, taken with the device, in a grid of 4x5. You cannot change the view of the camera roll. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or pinch to zoom. We appreciate that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing pictures via email still involves resizing but you can now share videos too, either via email or on Facebook. Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook or the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo. It's a nice feature but one that produces unrealistic results at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Pictures hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a time scroll and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn?t recognize .AVI files ? in other words, don?t expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 ? so, you can watch those formats on the Omnia W, it?s just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer's capabilities).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music + Videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when synching with Zune. The third section is podcasts where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music has a simple and straightforward interface. You won?t have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger ? you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The favorite, repeat and shuffle buttons can be found on the right side of the song artwork in the Now playing screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During song playback you can close the Music + Videos tile and go anywhere in the OS - a simple press on the volume button will prompt a now playing tab to emerge from the top bar and give you forward, back and pause options, as well as a button to jump back to the music player. The lockscreen offers almost the same functionality, sans the jump to music player option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get radio and marketplace links in the Music &amp; Videos tile. It doesn't offer the option to listen to online radio stations so you would need to insert the headgear to get reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the current frequency in very large digits ? swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction. You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen ? like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is relatively clean, but pretty quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hardly an inspiring musician, the Samsung Omnia W I8350 still does well enough to satisfy all, but the most demanding users out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Omnia W does greatly in terms of signal-to-noise levels, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk. The total harmonic distortion is kept well under control as well, but the frequency response and intermodulation distortion are not quite ideal and the volume levels are less than inspiring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a pair of headphones plugged in, the Samsung Omnia W I8350 stereo crosstalk increases and the intermodulation distortion rises, but the change in IMD is probably only detectable in lab conditions. It's a decent performance overall, but the volume levels are pretty low once again.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wide-angle camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia W is equipped with a 5 MP camera with autofocus, Geo-tagging, image stabilization and a single LED flash. It can capture images of up to 2592 x 1944 pixels resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple ? you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers very extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness, ISO and more. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key will wake the phone with a single press ? that is unlock it and start the camera. There's an option that prevents the shutter key from starting the camera if the proximity sensor is triggered (to prevent accidental launches when the phone is in your pocket). This option is off by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the Samsung Omnia W performs well but it does prefer very low ISO values and in turn produces slightly soft images at times where the lighting calls for something above ISO 100. Overall it does produce good results with good colors and nice detail with low noise. However some might prefer punchier colors from their cameraphone, which is something the Omnia W doesn't offer - not that it's bad, quite the opposite it does give truer colors that are closer to the real deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were impressed with the macro performance of the Samsung Omnia W. Here are a couple of samples, note that they were made using the automatic focus setting and not the macro one, meaning that the phone will take the hint even if you forget to set the right mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've enrolled the Omnia W in our photo quality compare tool to face the HTC Radar and Galaxy W. The lower ISO preference of the Omnia W will be obvious here and you can see firsthand how this can affect your photos in certain situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tool's page will give you all the information you need to look out for.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>720p video recording is the best Windows Phone can do for the time being so the Omnia W follows suit. It's not a bad quality cap by any means and for many people just the economy of on-board storage will be persuasive enough to opt for HD over FullHD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can use scenes, calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look at the Samsung Omnia W's 720p video sample. The frame rate hovers around 30 fps which is a stellar achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared an untouched 720p video sample from the Samsung Omnia W for direct download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being an HD-capable cameraphone the Omnia W enters our video quality comparison tool as well. You can pit it against any device we've tested to get the right idea before you decide on a new smartphone. Compared to the best in the class its 720p doesn't exactly shine but it will do for most common situations.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is a bit close-minded<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SamsungOmnia W has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and dual-band 3G with HSPA (14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA and stereo Bluetooth 2.1. Bluetooth is currently limited as to what it can do ? there?s no file transfer support, for one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing with a computer is done with the Zune computer application. It?s the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your Windows Phone ? there's no Mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync files with Zune over the USB cable and Wi-Fi. There?s a Mac version of it available too - Windows Phone 7 Connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional SD storage isn't available on Windows Phone so the Omnia W doesn't offer such an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another syncing option is the cloud. SkyDrive is a free Microsoft service that gives you 25GB of cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings Wi-Fi hotspot functionality too. All you need is an active SIM card with a data connection and you're all set.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer mobile does without Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer mobile is the go-to app for browsing the internet. It offers a pretty straight forward interface with the only visible aspect of it being the URL bar at the bottom fitted with a refresh button on the left.Swiping the bar upward reveals shortcuts for tabs, recent, favorites, add to favorites, share page, pin to start and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history but it does offer a very neat option to choose a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar, which is a handy shortcut for looking things up if you're not sure which site exactly will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we miss is text reflow (the automatic alignment of text into the screen) and the ability to open more than six tabs at a time. But performance is top notch - the browser relies on hardware graphics acceleration to provide smoother graphics (and video) and animation and uses the latest (and fastest) JavaScript engine too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft are so confident that they've set up a page specifically for testing the performance of your phone - both JavaScript and graphics. You can find the page here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing search on Windows Phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you search on Bing, one of the things that might be offered as a relevant result is an app from the Marketplace. For example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also offers song and barcode search natively. Sure there are apps for that on WP but it's neat to have it built right into the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera scanner can also snap a photo of text, perform OCR and translate it into another language.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Marketplace is where you shop for apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Currently the Windows Phone Marketplace offers over 45 thousand apps, which is enough to call a significant collection. Most household names like Angry Birds, Facebook and the likes are on WP7 so you don't have reason to worry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace is organized into four main sections ? applications, games and music. A fifth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update ? there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it?s on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under Categories you'll also find the Samsung Zone, which offers some exclusive content for Samsung Windows Phone devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the try option, which is available to many games and apps. It gives you a trial of a game before you decide to buy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as a what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and featured apps provides users with the top grossing games currently in the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too ? new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (it?s 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections ? games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox ? from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests ? which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there?s a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live ? the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace. We did test games like Need for Speed, Kinectimals, Angry birds and had no problems with the Omnia W, the 1.4GHz processor and Adreno 205 GPU were more than adequate in handling more complex graphics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps at the wheel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic mapping solution in Windows Phone is Bing Maps. They offer driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free in certain parts of the world but will inevitable take a hit once Nokia Drive gets really going as it offers free voice-guided navigation almost anywhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for Bing Maps's voice-guided navigation - here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that make reading easy. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though, it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all the new Maps can do for you though. The app will locate nearby points of interest with the new feature called Local Scout and it will even show you indoor maps of malls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from a "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse businesses, read people's review and find directions and contact information.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured Office<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive automatically syncs between the phone and your computer. In case you missed it, Microsoft are offering free 25GB of storage with each SkyDrive account (but individual files are limited to 100MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Locations tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through SharePoint or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections ? Documents, Locations and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let?s look at the two most important apps ? Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub offers Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you?d need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too ? but they are for viewing only, you can?t edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft?s collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you?re done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft?s fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors. Still the innovation that Mango has brought to Windows Phone Office is great and shows Microsoft is dedicated to improving the Office experience further.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Organizing skills are very well presented in the Windows Phone OS. Your garden variety apps for organizing your life are all preloaded and even if you need something more Samsung or the Marketplace will provide you with it for free in most situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's AllShare application has been around ever since the Galaxy S and we're glad to see it preinstalled on the Omnia W. It provides a simplified way of sharing your multimedia content via Wi-Fi, while Photo Studio gives you a set of shooting options for the built-in camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now application doubles as Daily Briefing, the app that serves to provide you with up to date information on current news, weather, stocks and calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone Mango provides users with the basics in smartphone organizing but, as we said in the beginning, if you need anything more the Marketplace is there too - it offers apps for just about everything - most of which are free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>WindowsPhone.com remotely protects your data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone website is the cloud of sorts for all WP7 smartphones. All you need to do to use the site is register your email (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) and then setup an account on your Windows Phone device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options given to you on the windowsphone.com website are limited to billing information and security. You can update your billing information, view the apps you've bought and go to the web version of the WP Marketplace and buy new apps. Note that they will be sent to your phone to be downloaded locally on the device, unlike on the Zune app for your PC or Mac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The features most important to users are the Find, Ring, Lock or Erase. To use them you'll have to input a phone number out of a total of 37 countries. After you've done this the website will have access to your phone's location so you'll be able to pinpoint its almost exact location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features are pretty self-explanatory - Ring will use your phone's ringtone to send a single if you've lost it around the house, Lock will lock it with a 4-digit PIN code and Erase will wipe all your sensitive data off the device so you don't have to worry about it falling into undesirable hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn't like about the windowsphone.com cloud is that it doesn't allow wireless sync like on the iCloud, for example. We just think that any cloud-based service should offer this. Also the number of countries that allow tracking your device is limited and many countries where WP is available won't have access to these much-needed features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the website includes guides on each individual feature of your phone and depending on where you live there's a very detailed list of providers and operators that offer WP handsets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You must've figured it by now. If you're coming from an Omnia 7 you can pass right along - nothing much for you here. The Omnia W has a smaller screen and less storage than its predecessor - and the beefed up processor cannot quite make up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia W is not an upgrade however. It's actually targeting a different set of users that were left out last year - deterred by the price tag of the original Omnia 7. The Omnia W and the Omnia 7 have nearly identical specs but this time Samsung are probing a lower market segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Omnia 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a different budget and Samsung are trying to bring in a different crowd. They didn't exactly keep it a secret either. Right from the start the Omnia W was supposed to be a midrange offering not a new Windows Phone flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Samsung are right to save their best shots for later. Much hyped Nokia are stealing the show right now and even vastly superior phones than the Omnia W could be victims of poor timing. Many people believe it's Lumia or nothing right now on the Windows Phone market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the Nokia Lumia 800 is trying hard to live up to the expectations with Nokia's bespoke maps and navigation, a superior 8 MP camera and a brilliant ClearBlack display. Not to mention the one-of-a-kind polycarbonate shell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 800 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it's up to the Samsung Omnia W though, the Lumia 800 can enjoy its triumph while it lasts. Samsung have other things to worry about and the Omnia W should focus instead on opponents it can actually tackle. The HTC Radar is one. It has a slightly bigger 3.8" screen, but we'd take the AMOLED one on the Omnia W any day. The higher-clocked CPU of the Omnia doesn't always make a big difference but the extra speed may come in handy in, say, the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Radar </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 is another midrange package to keep an eye on. It has a ClearBlack display but it's an LCD unit, not AMOLED. The Lumia is powered by the same 1.4GHz processor as the Omnia W. The free voice-guided navigation with Nokia Drive is part of the deal of course. The Lumia 710 has only seen a limited regional release so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 710 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes the Samsung Omnia W. Instead of aiming high, it makes itself comfortable in a relatively new territory for Windows Phone. Not ridiculously spec'd but solidly built and with enough personality. Powered by a 1.4GHz Snapdragon and flaunting a Super AMOLED screen, the Omnia W has enough of an edge over the main competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, comparisons to the original Omnia 7 will do it no favors. You almost can't help a sneaky feeling that Samsung have been playing by the book - not by the heart. That would be wrong though. The Omnia W just caters to a lower budget. And not making a bad job of it at all.</paragraph>
