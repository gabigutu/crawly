			<paragraph>Here comes the most equipped non-OS Motorola phone of all times! Not exactly a razor-thin phone, made of plumy plastic. It features a 2 megapixel camera with brilliant macro mode and flash LED, and a top-class display. 3G is a matter of fact. At the same time, its MP3 player as well as certain features, are somewhat poor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola Razr V3x was nominated Best 3G mobile phone at the recently celebrated 3GSM congress. Razr V3x is the best equipped non-OS Motorola Phone ever. Certain internet retailers already added Razr V3x to their online offers several weeks ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this review we provide you with a detailed review, which is supposed to help you decide, whether sparing money for V3x is worth the effort. You may also want to consider a purchase of the successor of the original Razr model, Motorola V3i, instead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The best of it is hardly visible at first sight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When first images of the new Motorola V3x came out discussions on whether it would really be much thicker than the Razr V3 model never ended. A few months later the size difference was already a fact. Those of you, who do not admit the gracious design of the original fashion piece of art, raise your hand!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola Razr V3x live</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Placed next to the forerunner</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When closed, the phone is 19.6 mm thick, which is half a cm more in comparison with Razr V3. The other two dimensions have not been modified - 10 cm of height and 53 mm of width. What has really increased is the weight of the device, which is 30 grams heavier than the forerunner. It is no medium-heavy phone anymore, but a true heavy-weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The phone in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In any case, Motorola V3x is not meant to end up in the hands of those who like to pose with their phone. This phone is rather made to be used by people in need of a clamshell phone with rich equipment, who are not willing to pay extra money for design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    All-side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola Razr V3x is a multimedia phone with 3G networks support. Unlike slim units, this device may easily remain unnoticed by common users. It will definitely catch the eye of experienced customers though. But, please, do not get me wrong. New Motorola Razr is a pretty attractive phone. Besides, have a look at the surrounding pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Not so thin anymore, but with far better equipment</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Heavy but elegant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Holding the phone in your hand is when you will notice its weight the most. As to your fingerprints, they will be remaining all over its surface. That's not only on the glass of the external display, but also on the rest of the phone's body. On the other hand, its plumy blue (or violet when lighted differently) plastic covers are pleasant to touch and look as if they were made of hard rubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glass of the external display is literally begging for your fingerprints</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover of the tested sample was having a rather negative play of approximately half a millimeter, which is a significant minus for the construction of the device. Not a big deal, you may say... Our experience however shows that regular use and especially frequent SMS writing make the cover slither even more. On the other hand, I cannot guarantee that the device we are testing had not been used in an inappropriate way by someone else before it got to us. Therefore, only time will tell, whether the play of the cover is a result of bad treatment or it is simply a constructional fault.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Loosing the back cover ? battery ? SIM card and memory card bed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover you will find a lithium-ion battery of 850 mAh capacity, which is expected to back up 250 hours of stand-by or 300 minutes of phone calls. So far I am quite impressed by the phone's battery life as it has been four days since I started to intensively test it and it still sustains. The battery state indicator on the display tells me that I still have 1/3 of energy available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the phone is shorter than its bottom one, so the bottom edge does not feature the shed common in other clamshell mobiles. Alike Razr V3, new model's top part fits into the recess of the bottom one. The bottom edge is made of silver plastic material. Do not look for a system connector here. Razr V3x has a classic miniUSB connector located on its right side. I am not sure if customers will find a USB cable for connection with PC in the original package of Motorola Razr V3x, because there was no box or accessories coming along with the tester we have been given. I made an effort to plug in a miniUSB cable of mine (an original product of Motorola), but I did not manage to charge the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Razr V3x opened</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;MiniUSB connector ? "Smart Key" button and volume control buttons ? voice control/camera release button</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right above the miniUSB connector there is a programmable button, which the manufacturer calls "Smart Key". A little bit further up you will find the volume control button. The voice control button and the camera release button are located on the opposite side of the device. I do not really get the idea of splitting the voice control button as the right side of the phone does not lack space. Besides, the camera release button has not only been designed much too small, but has also been placed on the wrong place and can be easily pressed by mistake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The construction joint is solid. It opens and closes smoothly and quietly, but when the top part of the phone rests against one's ear during a phone call, the joint gives out a creaky sound every time its opening limit gets passed. I picked up the original Razr to compare both models' joint reactions and I must say that no matter how strong I would press the forerunner's movable part to my ear, it would not give out a sound. In other words, Motorola does know how to design good joints, but this time it apparently wasn't their best job.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reasons to hate it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The external display situated below the main camera lens is wretched. Not only it is passive and extremely small, but it is able to show only 4K colors. It features a resolution of 96 x 80 pixels and is nearly illegible without backlighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>External display is located below the built-in camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the same time, the external display is extremely useful: it shows time, date and state icons. It provides details on missed events, displays caller's picture and name, and serves as a mirror for taking self-portraits. When music is running, it shows the name of the music file and the ringing profile that is currently activated.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reasons to love it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main display is superb. The dislike provoked by the outer display (if any) will instantly disappear once you open Motorola Razr V3x. The main display has a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels and shows 262K colors. Its surface is slightly bigger than the one of the main display of Motorola Razr. A mere square cm fits in more than 5000 pixels, so the borders between them can only be seen in macro pictures, if at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main display in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is TFT. To my surprise, picture is perfectly legible in direct sunlight. Beneath the display there is a tiny camera, meant to serve video calls exclusively. A detailed description of this camera is to be found further on, in the chapter dedicated to phone's main camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera for video calls</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keypad has undergone significant cosmetic modifications. The glossy layer of the original Razr model, which was designed to emanate reflections in the area of the main control button and then send those outwards, has been replaced by silver, rather matt plastic material. Dividing lines are bolder, while sea green backlighting is deeper than the one of the forerunner. On the right, above the keypad there is a small sensor, which regulates the intensity of the keys backlighting in accordance with the surrounding light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Keypad has been modified ? backlighting control sensor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The elements surrounding the main control button and its four ways have been reorganized. Along with the standard green and red receivers here you will also find a newcomer - a blue receiver, which activates video calls. Apart from the three standard GSM bands Motorola V3x also supports UMTS. The phone is equipped with a key combining correcting and back function, which comes to replace the long used central context key. This solution is similar to the one used by Sony Ericsson designers. Work with Motorola V3x's keypad is easy thanks to the minor uplift and the clear response of the keys. After a few days of practice you will be writing lightning fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Main control button ? keypad backlighting is very deep and evenly distributed</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What to improve<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It is a pity that Motorola has once again failed to modify the ancient user interface of its phones. Of course, it is not entirely bad, but it is full of improvable items, most of them regarding menu's structure. The outlook of the menu is a rather controversial issue as Motorola offers quite broad customization options here. At all events, a bit more experimentation with icons, references and list on behalf of Motorola designers would have not done any harm to the overall look of the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the main display can get dressed up in a go-as-you-please wallpaper, which can also be animated. Further on you can select the type of the clock, which will appear on the display - analog, digital, or simply none. The name of the operator can be placed either in the center, or in the margin of the screen. In the middle area you may want to see the icons of the functions assigned to each of the control button's ways. Any function can also be assigned to each context key as well as to the side "Smart Key".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Stand-by display ? main menu in the form of a matrix with icons ? main menu in list view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu viewed in the form of a list or a 12-item matrix can be customized too, including the option of an reordering. What is not possible is moving in the main menu via numeric shortcuts. Work in the main menu is generally pretty fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submenus are also presented by icons ? customization options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The option of changing menu outlook through the use of graphic themes is available, of course. The phone has three themes, none of which is new. Yet, they do look much better on the new Motorola's top-class display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard graphic theme is blue ? a dark one is available as well</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the internal and the external displays use the same background picture. The external one is however framed in black or white as its proportions are entirely different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;External display</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What else to add?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The location of the microphone is ideal for the right-handed. It is located on the left, beneath the keypad and thus comes straight in front of the user's mouth. The volume capacity of the receiver seems somewhat low in noisy street environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Microphone ? Receiver with Motorola logo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sounds come out from the rear side of the Motorola V3x. This is where the loud speaker is situated. Its grid is extremely soft, which worries me a bit as it goes down quite a lot when pressed in the spots of its two acoustic outlets. The speaker is loud enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loud speaker</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola V3x is definitely not a loud device. At the same time, however, its sound does not get distorted not even at its highest volume levels. As usual, it lacks bass elements. Heights are moderate and pleasant. The menu offers a 7-step correction of the bass elements as well as a 7-step stereo effect. I cannot say for sure what the impact of these two functions on the final sound of the voice speaker is as we have not been provided with earphones for Motorola Razr V3x. Anyway, each step Motorola has recently done in connection with earphones seems to be wrong. On one hand they have recently launched the successful Bluetooth trend enhancing its offer by many cool sports jackets, helmets and caps with integrated headsets. On the other hand, not having implanted at least a small earphone jack into Motorola V3x is a demonstration of pure arrogance and disrespect towards the end user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Selecting ringing profiles ? profiles setup options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone offers five ringing profiles, which help quickly select one's favorite ringing mode. They allow various melody and sound alert modifications. Two of those five profiles feature vibrations - one alerts by vibration only, while the other one vibrates and rings at a time. Volume is controlled separately, through side buttons. Each volume change is accompanied by a disturbing sound effect typical for all Motorola models. Ringing profiles can also be changed through the use of the side buttons when the phone is closed as all details are present on the external display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a profile with closed device</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the bottom part of the phone there is a decent neat band, which lights in blue when the phone is being charged or when receiving a call. Unfortunately, it doesn't light when there are incoming messages or missed calls, obviously because these are alerted by the external display. The latter is however pretty useless since it is almost illegible without backlighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulsing blue band</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All contacts in the phone book can be viewed either in the form of a classic list of names, each of which is accompanied by a tiny icon of the respective primary number, or in groups of three contacts only, each of which comes along with the icon of the respective primary number, the number itself and a mini picture. Move vertically to switch between contacts and horizontally to view all numbers and email addresses assigned to each contact. Messages and emails can be sent straight from the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Phonebook in the form of a simple list ? Make your choice</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a first and a last name, a nickname, 7 phone numbers, two email addresses, two websites, two full-size street addresses, birth date, a picture and a specific ringing melody. Additional fields can be added if necessary. What's more, the phone allows marking off the phone numbers that are to be video-called.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Views with pictures ? view at a selected contact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is searched by gradual writing of contact's names. It can be organized into groups, which are switched between by pressing the asterisk or hash key. Numbers, saved on the SIM card, constitute a separate group. Notwithstanding, contacts from both the SIM card and the phone memory are displayed within the main group all together. The phone offers a useful Email group, in which all contacts featuring an email address are gathered automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Inserting a new contact </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola V3x offers voice dialing. To activate it press the button that serves as a shared key together with the camera release button and pronounce the name of the respective person. The overall capacity of this phonebook remains a secret since Motorola does not offer any indicator, not even a simple graphic one. However, according to my experience with other Motorola devices, I expect the new Razr V3x to offer no less than a thousand of contacts. The phonebook seems to be using the shared memory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Choice based on the particular situation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola V3x is perfectly equipped for work with messages. Along with standard SMS it manages extended EMS, MMS and emails. When you create a new message, you will run into a new conception that was first launched in the E1070 model. According to this conception the user is no more provided with the option to choose the type of created messages. The phone is equipped with a single editor, which determines message type automatically and serves both text and multimedia messages. Even if not a bad idea at all, this solution has one crucial drawback - if you want to save money by sending several text messages in the form of a single MMS, you will have to attach a picture or a voice note to it. Otherwise, the editor will identify the written message as a pure text one and will send it as a SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both created and received messages are displayed on seven lines. When writing a SMS the editor counts from the first character on. It does not provide you with information on the overall number of extensive message parts until shortly before the message is sent. Message work is asisted by iTap - a typical dictionary for Motorola phones. iTap knows a reasonable amount of words. It shows no delay and is truly helpful. If necessary, it can be deactivated for good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Message menu ? writing a SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to create a MMS, open the phone's context menu, select the option "Insert" and then find the object you need in one of the multimedia folders. A MMS can contain pictures, sounds and video records, which can be both old and newly created. It is quite interesting that voice records can only be made during the creation of MMS. Motorola Razr V3x features no separate voice recorder. The phone offers an option to create independent sound MMS, which is located at the very end of the folders list, somewhere behind the groups of delivered and sent messages. As you can see, this is a perfect example of how illogically the phone menu is structured sometimes. The number of saved text and multimedia messages is only limited by the space available in the shared memory (a total of 61 MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  SMS becomes MMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emails are created separately from the rest of the messages. It is necessary to open the main menu and then open the folder with sent emails, where you will be offered the option to confirm or deny connection to your mailbox. Confirm to display your emails list. The option for creating a new email message is located at the very end of the list. This is an example of how complicated the operations in Motorola V3x's menu could be sometimes. On the other hand, it is without any doubt that the phone offers several different options for the user to get to one and the same function, so eventually one can even assign the entire email creating to one of the context keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several email accounts are managed effortlessly due to POP3 and IMAP4 protocols and SSL back-up. Emails are a subject of automatic or manual check. They can be checked in pre-set intervals too. The phone asks you which one of these three options you prefer every time you enter your email box. Motorola Razr V3x is not able to download emails in HTML format. Email messages can be instantly replied or forwarded. Newly created emails can contain multimedia attachments, including picture in full resolution taken with the phone's built-in camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Not the best 2 megapixels<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this chapter we are going to take a closer look at Motorola V3x's camera and its work. It prides on the label "2.0 mega pixels", which seems to impress nobody else but beginners nowadays. Experienced users know well, that not even Carl Zeiss can fully guarantee camera's high performance. The camera release button located on the right side of the phone is divided. It constitutes a key assembly together with the voice dialing button. As I already mentioned, this constructional solution seems illogical to me. In result, the release button is much too small, left alone the fact that its location is not appropriate as it is easy to press by mistake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Taking pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lens of the phone's main camera is another part that has not been located properly. It is situated much too low. If you take pictures with open clamshell, be sure that a part of your pointing finger will be visible in almost all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera lens is located much too low and thus is easily covered by user's pointing finger</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola Razr V3x does not allow a horizontal hand-hold, even if the location of its release button permits such a solution. The orientation of the menu does not reposition, but remains vertical. The basic interface of the camera control menu features quite a smart design. Due to its transparency images of captured scenes are displayed across the entire screen. Yet, the video application still features 100%-cover menu. When pictures are taken or videos are shot, only the functioning part of the keypad is illuminated. An interesting effect, indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When pictures are taken, only the working part of the keypad is illuminated</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Interface when taking a picture</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to sample pictures, Motorola V3x is best at capturing objects at medium distance. Remote objects are defocused, with areas of similar colors merging one into another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     &nbsp;&nbsp;     Sample photos in full resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with a built-in LED flash, whose function is not limited to the moment of the photo capture only. The LED is able to light constantly. It is strong and evenly distributed, and is especially helpful when night mode is insufficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Built-in LED</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Using flash ? night mode without flash</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the automatic exposure compensation and the white color balance work quite well. The pictures displayed below present all setup options available in the phone - two negative factors, two positive factors, and automatic in the middle one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Various settings for exposition compensation; the picture in the middle was taken in automatic mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features several preset options. All 6 pictures displayed below were taken from one and the same point in our office. I would simply activate all available preset balance options in the following order: "automatic", "sunny", "cloudy", "interior (home) ", "interior" and "night".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Preset options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures can also be taken with the other camera, but they are nearly unusable, even if made in highest quality and resolution mode. This camera is primarily meant to be used for video calls or for tiny pictures for name contacts and MMS. In poor light conditions both the main camera and the front tiny camera record quite high noise levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Poor pictures taken with the inside camera</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Macro master<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Macro in Motorola Razr V3x is brilliant! It is easily activated by a tiny slide key located on the right beneath the display. Results are stunning. Texts are perfectly clear. Objects can be photographed from a distance of mere 4-5 cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro mode is activated by a slide button</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;  Left picture is taken in standard mode, the right one - in active macro mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Macro mode qualities are best visible in texts tries</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola V3x shoots good video records, just like many other photo mobiles equipped with 3GP support and a resolution of 176 x 144 pixels. As to pictures, they look fine in the phone, but loose any value when applied in a PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video 1: street life (163 kB, 3GP)Video 2: changes in white balance while shooting (136 kB, 3GP)Video 3: zooming in the middle of shooting (107 kB, 3GP)Video 4: figure pace (123 kB, 3GP)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can be shot with both the main camera on the rear cover of the phone and the front small one. Record length is limited to 30 seconds or even less, if memory is limited. While shooting you can also apply a two-step zoom and other picture settings (see videos).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Chaos in the menu...chaos in music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The structure of the phone's menu makes me constantly wonder. Why does the camera occupy two positions in the main menu (once as a camera, once as a video camera) since both these icons are to be found on first position in the multimedia folder? Besides, I do not get the entire idea of doubling icons since I am allowed to freely switch between photo and video camera once I am inside the camera application. The "Airplane mode" is doubled as well. This is a pretty useful function as it deactivates the phone part of the device and permits the user to keep on using it for other purposes. What I do not understand however is why it appears not only in the main menu, but also in the Settings submenu...</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Java player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Activating airplane mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The airplane mode saves a lot of energy. This way battery capacity can be used for listening to music, for example. As mentioned above, the phone lacks a connector for wire earphones. The MP3 player is quite illogical and is a subject of criticism too. As usual, the player can be found in the "Games and applications" folder. On one hand, this folder is quite helpful as it orders files by artist or album. On the other hand, however, it does not get minimized. All these limitations made me search further in the menu until I found out that MP3 files can also be played by direct activation of the "Sounds" folder. Here is where songs can actually run in the background...</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Multimedia player&nbsp; &nbsp;"Sounds" player ? Sound setup options ? minimized music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Within the "Sound" folder you can create tabs, similar to the fields in the phonebook and then move inside them by using the asterisk and the hash key. Music files can be organized into playlists, which can be consequently ordered by genres and located into the tabs mentioned above. The player offers repeating and random play options. About sound improvement functions, see above (stereo effect and bass elements).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Music info on the external display when the phone is closed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When music is minimized, file's name remains on the stand-by display. Music files are switched by the horizontal ways of the cursor key. Volume levels are controlled through the buttons located on the sides of the phone. Of course, the music player is functional even if the device is closed. In such case the name of the played file is viewed on the external display. Files are switched between through the use of the side key.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time organizer, internet and other extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first position inside the Tools menu is occupied by the alarm clock. It offers several alarms as well as several time options. Here you will also find a text note option, thanks to which it is possible to use the alarm clock as a "reminder". Notwithstanding, the calendar is a much better application to use as a reminder, because of its ability to fit in events with pre-setup duration, alarm and repetitions. The calendar offers a month and a week view as well as a list of reminders related to the respective day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menu with useful functions ? month, week and day view at the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Inserting a new event</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu with extra functions offers two interesting applications: a calculator and an integrated currency converter. There is no voice recorder or timer in the phone. Motorola Razr V3x supports Java 2.0, which is pretty fast according to the JBenchmark test results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculator ? preinstalled games</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main function of the internet browser is to open WAP pages and it fulfills it perfectly. The display offers 8 lines of text. The browser is able to open web pages too, but the font of those is not automatically adjusted to the size of the display, which results into a lot of scrolling. Motorola Razr V3x deserves a compliment for implementing internet connection through APN.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Built-in internet browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Data transfer, necessary for internet browsing, is offered by GPRS Class 10, while instant data transfers are executed through UMTS. The phone gets connected to a PC through Bluetooth or a USB cable. Let me remind you, that Motorola Razr V3x is equipped with a standard miniUSB connector, so the only thing you will have to do is get yourself a proper cable, unless you have already obtained one in your digital camera package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tough battle<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is where Motorola Razr V3x is heading to. The phone is a perfect solution for work due to its good phonebook, well-organized calendar and fast data transfers in 3G networks. Besides, its rich multimedia equipment will hardly leave fun fans indifferent. The problem, however, is that the current market is already full of devices of this kind. To my opinion, the new Motorola V3x is simply not "superb" enough to make the competition fans break away from their favorite models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Vodafone offers an additional, silver version of the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that Razr V3x's display presents a true spectacle. The phone is quite charismatic due to its neat plumy color and solid construction, which will definitely attract a certain number of customers. On the other hand, the performance of its camera is incomparable with the high-class pictures of the leader in the photo mobiles segment - Sony Ericsson. The illogic steps in creating the menu and the terribly low quality of the external display are among the most significant drawbacks of Motorola Razr V3x. If fast UMTS and video calls are not your priority, you may want to get yourself Razr V3i instead.</paragraph>
