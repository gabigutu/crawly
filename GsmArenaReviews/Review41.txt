			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Is surfing the web on your phone as important to you as calling and texting? So, how does it feel? That?s the question we?ll be trying to answer. Mobile browsers are becoming an essential piece of software for mobile phones. And the best way to get the biggest screen real estate for browsing is hooking yourself up with a touchscreen phone!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, handhelds are getting more and more of the Internet browsing pie and even more so their touchscreen counterparts. So we decided it?s time we looked real close at how those measure up one against each other. In this article we try to break down the browser experience into basic components and score every single one of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all of our reviews we try to cover web browsing but this time we?re taking it further. The most popular touchscreen mobile phone browsers are lined up for inspection and ready for duty. We tested browser performance from page rendering to cache handling and ran a number of benchmark tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Prepare to meet the contenders. Mobile Safari is represented by the iPhone 3GS and the good old iPhone 3G, which still sticks around. The Mozilla-based Maemo browser steps up on the Nokia N900. Next up is the HTC HD2, which was our testing platform for Internet Explorer Mobile 6, Opera Mobile 9.7 and the ever-popular Opera Mini 4.2. For Opera Mobile 9.5, we used Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Apple iPhone 3GS ? Nokia N900 ? HTC HD2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Android corner, it?s the default browser running on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 and the Motorola MILESTONE. The XPERIA X10 is also the testing ground for the touch version of the Dolphin web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian browsing was put to the test on the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and Samsung i8910 Omnia HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 5800 XpressMusic ? Samsung i8910 Omnia HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we didn?t forget the youngest OS in the bunch ? WebOS ? and its browser, tested on the Palm Pre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Palm Pre</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Fennec browser didn?t make it, as it was released after we were well into this article.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There?s a lot going on behind-scenes for you to just punch in the address and hit Go. Some of the technicalities are hard to avoid but basically, we?ve tried to gauge the user experience by testing the key elements that make up comfortable browsing as we see it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You know, this whole shootout grew quite big and we tried to make it both informative and entertaining. On the last page of this review you?ll find all the data we?ve compiled in a comparison table. You can certainly skip right to it of course but it won?t tell you the whole story. So, here we go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Page loading speed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All right then, you know what WWW stands for. World Wide Wait. right? Nope, not funny any more. It was a good joke though back in the days of dial-up. With broadband and the evolution of desktop browsers Wait is no more the case. When we?re talking internet on the go, in most cases you have to wait for the page to load. This includes the time to download the data and get it processed on the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Here?s how we tested:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We set up our own fast Wi-Fi hot-spot and prepared three static pages on our server specifically for this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>http://www.gsmarena.com/static.html http://www.gsmarena.com/static2.html http://blog.gsmarena.com/staticb.html</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give all browsers equal footing we stripped these pages of all JavaScript and Flash, the banners you see there are just images. We loaded all pages on each mobile browser 4-5 times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We timed the loading process carefully, by recording the test on video, so the measurements are accurate up to a single video frame (1/30 of a second).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For each browser we took the best time (not an average!) for each of the pages. To give you a better perspective on the results, we threw a notebook in the test: one Atom-powered Asus Eee PC 900A running Firefox 3.5 for Windows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were very glad to see two phones outrun the netbook in this test. Opera Mini is blazing fast and even over a Wi-Fi connection it managed to win the race. If this test was over a 2G connection, the Mini advantage could have been even more impressive, due to the compression applied on the server end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari on iPhone 3GS is the fastest real mobile browser these days, it really is worth all the hype. Running on iPhone 3G however, Safari is not that spectacular and it was outrun by most of the competition. Next in line are Palm Pre and Nokia N900 with very good results, both being fairly new devices with strong chances to improve with upcoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite surprisingly, the mobile IE6 showed some good results in the page loading test while the Opera-s on HTC HD2 and Samsung OmniaPRO were quite slow. Please note that this is page loading only, Opera is very fast in zooming and panning but that?s another test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, Opera 9.7 on the HD2 was one of the fastest browsers to show some content on the screen and this also adds to a better user experience. The Android browsers are nothing spectacular in terms of speed, but we can see the improvement with the higher OS versions. Plus X10 is still an unfinished product, it will be interesting to time it again once released.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S60 web browser feels slow, even slower than the actual results. Nokia 5800 outperformed some of the competition, but was the only browser, which sometime failed to open the test pages at all. The Samsung Omnia HD results are downright embarrassing, so you might see a point in the user?s petition. In the defense of the Symbian contenders, we might say that both devices weren?t running on the latest firmware, released in January 2010.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Page layout<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTML and CSS are complex and expressive languages but the developers of the competing browser platforms see things differently. One browser will arrange the elements of a page one way, but another will take a completely different approach. The consequences vary from ruined aesthetics to almost unusable pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, in this case we won?t be able to give precise measurements. The results are based on our experience with browsing various web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, all mobile browsers gave very good results here and you can rest assured they won?t render any page unusable. In other words, this chapter will only probably count for the most zealous perfectionists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N900 comes first; not even a single page managed to catch it off guard. Next, with near excellent results come Safari, the webOS and the Android browsers. Then Opera Mobile 9.7 followed by Opera 9.7 and IE Mobile 6. Even the mobile Internet Explorer 6 scores quite high, especially considering how bad the previous version was.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only contender in this test with average score is naturally Opera Mini. Given that it works in a completely different way and that it focuses on speed and speed only, this is quite understandable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>JavaScript<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>JavaScript is the scripting language of the Web. It runs in the browser and can make sites very interactive and rich in features. JavaScript powers a lot of things ? from complex animated website interfaces, through games, to something as ludicrous as a 3D renderer in a web page. How well JavaScript performs ? in terms of both speed and features ? is essential for today?s web sites.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>How we tested:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We used two different web-based tools in this trial. JSBenchmark evaluates the speed of the JavaScript engine, while the Acid 3 test examines the amount of the features supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We let the Opera Mini skip this test because its specific way of operation makes it incomparable to the other browsers as far as Javascript is concerned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the speed test, the Apple iPhone 3GS claims the crown, closely followed by the Android browser running on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10. The X10 seems to have the potential to outrun the iPhone when it gets some further software tweaking, unless of course its Javascript engine is out of the to-do list already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N900 slightly disappointed with about half the score of the 3GS and an equal score to Palm Pre and the Motorola MILESTONE. The slowest of the bunch are the two Symbian contenders and the older version of Opera Mobile ? 9.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mobile 9.7 is the unchallenged leader in the JavaScript features test (Acid3). It scores the impeccable 100/100. For your reference, desktop Firefox 3.5 scores 93/100 and desktop IE8 can?t even complete the test. Mobile Safari comes next after Opera Mobile, with scores slightly varying on the 3GS and the 3G. The Android browsers show good JavaScript support (93/100). The S60 results are disappointing, while the Internet Explorer score is simply ridiculous.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Flash is the de facto video streaming standard of the Web; it is also the most popular game platform on the Internet. The platform has rich features and high requirements, so naturally not all phones have full Flash support. There are four possible levels of Flash contents compatibility on your mobile ? none, limited (displaying only banners and such), limited with YouTube support and full-featured Flash, which matches the desktop browsing experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N900 is virtually unchallenged in this department. The Symbian browser handled the full YouTube, but chocked on other video sharing sites. The rest either had no Flash support at all or all redirect to an app for YouTube viewing, which is just as well ? YouTube-only Flash isn?t much of a feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fullscreen, landscape, auto-rotate<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s quite important whether the browser makes full use of the phone display. The fullscreen option is essential for mobile devices given the limited screen real estate. So is landscape viewing, as most phones have their displays in portrait orientation. Automatically switching between modes by tilting the phone ? autorotate ? has grown from an irritating and slow gimmick to an important feature, which users rightfully require.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ideally, the browser should offer some controls when loading the page, automatically hiding them when the page is fully loaded, so it can use all the screen estate for viewing. Most of our contenders behave in exactly this way. Plus, you have an option to disable the auto-hide from the setting menu. The exceptions are the mobile Internet Explorer 6, which has no option to leave the controls on the screen and S60 browser, which switches to fullscreen only manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only browsers with no fullscreen option are Safari on iPhone and Opera Mini. No matter what you do, you always see the status bar on the top and the controls on the bottom. Palm Pre is an interesting animal, because it leaves the status bar in portrait mode, but has fullscreen in landscape.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Zooming, panning, kinetic scrolling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Zooming is an important feature for both fitting as much as possible on a small screen as well as navigation. Zoom methods are key ? everyone knows about the iPhone?s pinch-zoom and double tapping. They are that popular because they are really easy to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double tap is currently the most popular zooming method and probably the one used most often. It?s very convenient and fast and in the most cases is all you need. The only problem is the lack of control. All our contenders support this method except the Android browser on the Sony Ericsson X10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two-finger pinch zoom is the trendiest zooming method. It?s very natural, the only problem is the virtually impossible one hand operation. As far as current technology goes, you need a capacitive screen for this one, but also software support in the browser (and the OS in general). Mobile Safari, the webOS browser and Opera Mobile 9.7 on HTC HD2 have this kind of zoom control. The Android browser on HTC Hero (ver 1.5) and Motorola MILESTONE (ver 2.0) do too, but Sony Ericsson X10 (ver 1.6) doesn?t.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung?s one finger zoom (available on both the OmniaHD and OmniaPRO) comes in at a close second ? it?s very comfortable for one hand use. The shaky implementation on the OmniaPRO doesn?t look good though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maemo Browser uses a unique spiral gesture for zooming, which is interesting stuff to show to your friends, but feels more like a chore in everyday use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mini is a special case, as it?s not a full web browser, so its capabilities are limited. It has just one zoom level and you have to rely on the mini-map mode to get around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dolphin and all Android browsers prior to 2.0 has a magnifying glass feature ? like overview but the small ?window? of content is magnified. This was the quickest way to navigate complex pages because it was so accurate ? you can read the content you?re about to zoom into, no need to squint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since we are only testing touchscreen devices here, panning on the pages can only be done in one way ? by dragging your finger across the screen. There isn?t really a different way to do this. The only difference is the smoothness of the movement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since there is no easy way to measure this you have to believe our subjective feeling here ? the best are Safari on iPhone 3GS and Opera Mobile 9.7 on HTC HD2 with Palm Pre and Android browsers following closely. The worst experience came with Opera Mini, but this is excusable ? this is a Java app after all. The S60 browser is not that much better really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kinetic scrolling means that the page movement has momentum. Think of it like pushing an actual piece of paper ? it doesn?t stop moving the moment you lift your finger off it and the faster you flick it, the further it will go. It makes scrolling more natural and faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the browsers we tested support kinetic scrolling. The properties are quite different and which is best is really a matter of preference ? some have more inertia and scroll further, some stop too soon on big pages. Opera Mini 4.2 doesn?t have kinetic scrolling, but the upcoming 5.0 version will fix this. The tested Samsung i8910 Omnia HD lacked it too, but the new firmware should have taken care of this omission.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Text size setting and text reflow<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Limited screen size also means that you have to fit more information into less space, and keep the text readable too. User control over text size is important for comfortable reading. Most of the competitors offer the standard web setting with the 5 choices we know from the desktop browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem is that in some cases (including our own gsmarena.com) these text file size settings do nothing. Yes, they only work if the web page designer chose to give users this luxury. And by the way, it?s hard to come up with a good design which looks as expected in all text sizes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maemo browser on the Nokia N900 and Opera Mobile use a far better approach ? they give the users just 3 size options, but they work uncompromisingly, regardless of how the web page is coded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile Safari and webOS don?t offer any text size settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text reflow (dynamic refitting of text to match the width of the display port) makes sure the text doesn?t run too wide, so that each line of text fits horizontally on the screen (hence no need for horizontal scrolling). Fortunately, you can find the text reflow feature in all touch web browsers except for Safari, webOS and S60.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Address suggestion, history and cache<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To get to a page you need to type its address or URL. Address suggestion works a bit like T9 ? as soon as you type a part of the address it will be prompted to you if you?ve visited the site before. This makes navigating to your favorite sites much easier. Some browsers even suggest doing a Google search instead of navigating to a URL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Address suggestion might seem like a small part of the browser but it can be a huge annoyance if it doesn?t work well. The Maemo Browser and the WebOS Browser are our favorites here ? they suggest URLs based on any part of their address and even the page title too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Say, you?ve logged on to a website about laptops but completely forgot its name. The page probably had ?laptop? in the title and both browsers will retrieve the address from your history for you. Other browsers don?t stand a chance here unless the URL explicitly started with the word ?laptop?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What that means is other browsers suggest URLs based on your browsing history as well, but only with the beginning of the address ? e.g. ?gsm? works for www.gsmarena.com, but ?arena? doesn?t do a thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer Mobile 6 suggests adding a .com or .org domain suffix (so you can just type gsmarena and save four clicks) but that cuts off the suggestions from history, so you have to scroll to get to them. The four saved clicks are not worth it at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S60 browser however had it even worse ? there is address suggestion, but if you use a fullscreen QWERTY to type in the address, you don?t see the suggestions until you close the keyboard. You could use the mini-QWERTY keyboard to avoid that, but we wouldn?t recommend it ? unless you have unlimited patience to hit those tiny buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>History stores all the sites you?ve visited recently and helps find sites you?d like to go back to but forgot to bookmark. How the back button works is important too ? some just go back to the previous page, others show a visual history: thumbnails of pages you browsed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the participants in this article store your browsing history, with the sad exception being the Dolphin browser. At least it saves some grace with the list of most visited pages, but it?s hardly good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S60 browser, IE6 and the webOS browser come up next as they offer history but there is no way of sorting it. All you get is an endless list of URLs. OmniaHD still fares better than the rest of its pack as it also offers visual aid in the form of thumbnails next to each page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the others offer sorting by day or week, which is really helpful when you are looking for a page you visited, say yesterday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the back button is concerned, every mobile browser will allow you to go at least one step back. It?s pretty much standard equipment across the whole selection though there are of course differences in how it?s implemented in the different platforms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maemo web browser and the S60 browsers take the crown with support for multiple back steps and visual aid ? seeing thumbnails makes it much easier to decide just how many steps you would like to go back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the growing speeds of wireless Internet, the cache is a very important part of browsers. The cache stores items from pages you?ve opened (possibly even the whole page) in the internal memory, so next time you try to view the page, instead of reloading everything, some of the page elements are pulled out of the cache.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This saves time and bandwidth as the browser just checks if it has the most recent version of the item, which uses very little data compared to actual loading of, say, an image. How much (and what kind of content) a browser stores in the cache is vital for the quick loading of pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WebOS is a cut above the rest here, going the Firefox way and caching entire pages so going back is very fast. The same holds true for the Opera Mobile but there were some issues with it when going back so we are giving it a 9.5 instead of full 10 here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S60 browser behaved in a completely different manner on the 5800 XpressMusic (where it cached whole pages) and on OmniaHD where it cached nothing whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other browsers do not cache the HTML scripts but the images make up for most of the traffic anyway. If the page is long however, like a blog with many posts, and the HTML takes long to load, it will be a while before the content is showed on the screen, so this solution is less than perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mini works differently than the rest but nonetheless caches whole pages (it?s all about speed and bandwidth-saving with this one).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Password manager and form auto-filling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Password managers save time by remembering the login information for you. It?s filled in automatically and all you have to do is tap ?Log in?. Of course, you have to be careful with that ? it won?t reveal your password but anyone using your phone can log on to any site that the password manager remembers. Auto filling forms other than username and password fields saves a lot of taps if you have to fill in the same information more than once ? it suggests things based on what you?ve typed so far, much like the address suggestion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer Mobile, the WebOS Browser and Opera Mini forgo all sorts of form filling, while the rest have at least password management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The champions here are the Android, Maemo and S60 browsers. The Safari and both Opera mobile implementation don?t have that and since Opera still haven?t included auto form-filling in their desktop browser you shouldn?t expect it to happen any time soon.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tabs and popup blocking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At any one moment, you may want to keep several pages opened at once. The ?Open in new window? option complements this and is very handy when one page links to several others you want to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The popup blocker tries to block pop-ups from sites ? most of these are just ads. You can allow sites to open pop-ups if they use it as a part of their interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer Mobile 6 is the biggest disappointed here with lack of tabs whatsoever. The S60 browser is close behind, because it can handle multiple pages at once but there?s no option to open a new one yourself - a link has to be set to open in new window so it can open in a new tab in the first place. Not only is this solution not ideal, but it is almost useless the way we see it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dolphin browser on the XPERIA X10 offers tabs that look just like the ones on a desktop browser, while the Maemo and the WebOS launch multiple instances of the browser instead of using tabs. This is fine until you have several other apps running and then simply ?tabbing through? the open pages becomes cumbersome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the browsers with multiple tab support rely on some sort of Pages view, which shows thumbnails of the open webpages, with a New Tab button, so they can be pronounced joint-winners in this respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every browser with support for multiple tabs has popup blocking as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text copying, searching<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Other important usability feature is without a doubt the option to search for a specific bit of text on a page or to copy text from a page and paste it in another application ? email, a note, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the clear losers here is Internet Explorer Mobile 6, which has rather erratic text selection and can?t search for text on the page (even Opera Mini does that). The copy paste functionality is actually there but it?s virtually impossible to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S60 browser also fails miserably on both the 5800 XpressMusic and the Omnia HD. It can?t copy text, which may be excusable for Opera Mini but hardly so in a proper smartphone. At least, the find on page feature works fine to salvage some dignity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Opera Mini is another disappointment here for the lack of copy / paste functionality. At least it offers searching and highlighting of bits of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WebOS Browser is quick at selecting paragraphs but that?s all the accuracy you get ? you can?t select just one sentence. Find-on-page is missing but this is the lesser of two evils.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile Safari came a bit late to the copy/paste party, but the implementation is very solid. Too bad Apple didn?t see fit to include a text search function either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroB and the Dolphin browsers are performing neatly in both find on page and copy paste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?Mark all? feature of the Opera Mobile and Android, which highlights all occurrences of the searched text is the decider here. It works just great for skipping through tons of texts for a specific term that has more than one occurrence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gold medal goes to Android just because it marks all the occurrences of a given string as you type it and scrolls up or down automatically, much like your desktop Mozilla browser would.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Downloads<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to downloading files on the go there are several important aspects to be considered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The option to save a webpage for offline viewing keeps it at hand even when an Internet connection is not available. Downloading behaviour should be different according to the different kinds of content ? whether it?s a picture for a wallpaper, a sound file for a ringtone or even an unsupported file format. A proper download manager keeps things organized, especially if there are several downloads running at once.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You know what they say about the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. While the table gives information about the different parts of browsing, it doesn?t tell the whole story. So, for each of the browsers we tested, we?ll give a short overview of the general experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mobile Safari on iPhone 3GS (and 3G)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On paper, it looks like Opera Mobile 9.7 beats the iPhone?s Mobile Safari but? well? the table doesn?t tell the whole story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile Safari lacks things like text reflow, a download manager and saving pages for offline viewing. But it is the browser that defines usability in today?s handheld browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most browsers have already copied the kinetic scrolling and some are even doing the pinch zoom too. Mobile Safari can handle multiple pages trouble-free and its speed is off the chart. Running on the iPhone 3GS, it topped the JavaScript benchmark but unfortunately the iPHone 3G scored exactly half the 3GS points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At loading pages, the 3GS also ranked second only to Opera Mini while the 3G with its slower CPU lagged behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest blotch (seemingly) on the iPhone?s resume is the lack of Flash support. On the other hand YouTube works like a charm with the preinstalled YouTube client and that?s all the Flash support most phones get anyway. Unfortunately, videos from other Flash websites and Flash games are certainly a no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N900 might have been the pioneer of full Flash support but more are following (Hero and Nexus One are the first names that spring to mind) and the Safari risks lagging behind on that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mr. Jobs is not keen on letting full Flash on the iPhone and until that changes, Flash is just another thing the iPhone won?t get. And since the Apple tablet ? the iPad also lacks any kind of Flash support you are strongly advised not to hold your breath just yet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>MicroB browser on Nokia N900<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you?re reading this in Firefox, then you?re seeing what Nokia N900 users see. The Maemo browser uses the same rendering engine as Firefox, so pages look the same. For now, it has Flash 9.4 so you get the full Flash experience ? no Flash Lite will-it-it-work guesswork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>?For now? means there?s a Flash 10.1 update coming up ? you know, the one with hardware acceleration. If you need to use web sites that are heavy on Flash, the Nokia N900 simply has no alternative at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ability to view multiple pages goes without saying but perhaps the killer feature of the Maemo Browser (oh well, besides full Flash support, the excellent rendering and all?) is the add-on system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s the same add-on system that so many people find invaluable in the desktop Firefox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as hardware goes, the Nokia N900 runs on the same Cortex A8 CPU at 600MHz as the iPhone 3GS, the Omnia HD and the Palm Pre. Bottom line, it?s blazing fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard double tap zoom is complemented by the spiral-gesture, which was a bit slow in our experience ? it takes 4 turns of the spiral to fully zoom in. The N900 uses a resistive touchscreen so pinch zooming is a no-go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Opera Mobile 9.7 on HTC HD2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 is in the game with two browsers. Opera Mobile 9.7 scored high in almost all fields and the overall experience is great. Panning and zooming are very fast (hello, pinch zoom) and the text is reflowed almost immediately to fit the screen when you change the zoom level. Vertical scrolling is really fast ? there?s no need for screen re-drawing. Panning involves a bit of redrawing but it takes less than a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search bar, the handling of multiple tabs, the saving of pages and files all add up to almost desktop level experience. JavaScript performance was decent (at iPhone 3G levels) and the lack of Flash support is the biggest disadvantage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer Mobile 6 on HTC HD2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer Mobile 6 is the second web browser available on the HD2. Version 6 is a lot better than its predecessors, but still has a lot of rough edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ergonomics are not quite right to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming with the zoom slider requires too many taps. The address suggestion adds ?.com?, ?.net?, etc. at the end of the address, which pushes the suggestions from history all the way down. You need to scroll to get to those even though they are the more useful ones. The lack of minimap complicates the navigation of sites that are not optimized for mobile viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>IE Mobile 6 handles only one page at a time and won?t play YouTube videos. The layout and JavaScript performance were reasonable. Overall, IE Mobile is much better than it used to be, but we?d go with Opera Mobile any day.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Opera Mobile 9.5 on Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Opera Mobile 9.5 running on the Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO rendered pages less accurately than the more recent Opera Mobile 9.7. And despite the 800MHz CPU beating in the OmniaPRO?s chest, it scored the measly 6 points on the JavaScript benchmark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the features are on par with the newer version but (maybe because of the different CPU) things ran a bit slower. Still, you get the ability to save entire pages, an excellent download manager, support for tabs and the rest.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Browser on Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 uses the default Android browser with no visible customizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of a minimap, there?s a page overview with a small window that you can drag around ? the content inside is magnified so you can actually read the text. This is the best method to navigate large sites that we?ve seen so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default browser scored highly in our test, Flash support is the only serious omission.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dolphin Browser on Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just out of curiosity we installed the free third-party Dolphin web browser on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Feature wise, it adds tabs on top of the page for easy switching between multiple pages. Gestures are enabled as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gestures can do a lot of things (Back, new bookmark, new tab, etc.) and you can draw your own gestures. But the browser is not that good in recognizing them, so similar gestures can give you trouble.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the page offers an RSS feed, there will be a new entry in the Android notification panel allowing you to subscribe. A Compact page option reflows the page in a forced mobile view, even if the website in question doesn?t offer such a feature.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>WebOS Browser on Palm Pre<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>WebOS: the very name is a promise of a darn good browser. And well, the WebOS browser surely delivers. It lacks some minor features but, overall, the browser is very fast and can handle every page you throw at it. And that?s what really counts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Palm web browser renders pages nicely and the speed of the browser is commendable. Entering addresses is simple thanks to the excellent auto suggestion, which also doubles as a search toolbar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get to the page, kinetic scrolling and fast drawing, coupled with pinch zooming make getting around even complex pages a breeze. Screen auto rotation is very quick as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of text reflow is annoying though ? the browser formats paragraphs so they fit the screen, but only at a specific zoom level. If you zoom in closer you?ll have to scroll sideways. There?s no text size setting either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Palm WebOS smartphones have a dedicated app to view YouTube videos, so that?s covered. In addition, full Flash support is just around the corner, as Adobe promise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WebOS browser handles multiple pages by putting them each in a separate card, there are no tabs. But that just reinforces the notion that the web is an integral part of WebOS, each page treated as if it were an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that integration means it assumes there?s a constant connection to the Internet, so don?t ask if you can save pages for offline viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a Find-on-page option, form auto-filling, a password manager and a download manager are the other omissions in the WebOS Browser.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S60 Browser on Samsung i8910 Omnia HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The browsing experience on the Samsung i8910 OmniaHD is a mixed bag. The display is simply beautiful, the browser renders pages very well and YouTube works fine. But the browser is sluggish and there are plenty of bugs ? much more than you?d expect on a mature platform like Symbian (even if it is the 5th edition), and the OmniaHD has been out almost a year now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript performance is dismal, which is hardly surprising given the general slowness of the phone. What?s surprising is that the OmniaHD runs on a Cortex A8 CPU at 600MHz and has a dedicated graphics chip. This hardware should be able to offer blazing fast speed ? much the same way it does on the iPhone 3GS or the Nokia N900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now is time for the ergonomics. There?s kinetic scrolling but it?s hard to spot ? the momentum is too little. When you zoom in, a minimap appears, which would have been helpful if you could hide it in some way ? nope, it?s there and won?t go away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A command as simple as Back is painfully complicated in fullscreen mode ? you have to get out of fullscreen (there?s no hardware back key), press Back and then get back into fullscreen again. To get to fullscreen though you have to go all the way to Menu, Display options, Fullscreen ? that?s way too many clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming is handled by either double taps or the one-finger option. Fine and dandy, but slow scrolls are usually mistaken for the one finger zoom gesture. And each time you zoom in or out, the browser will shift the section you?re viewing, perhaps trying to fit the text on the screen. Too bad it misses.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S60 Browser on Nokia 5800 XpressMusic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is the chance for Symbian and its browser to redeem themselves. And the results are much better this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CPU is slower, the slowest of the bunch and it shows in the JavaScript benchmark. Still, the browser ticks faster and is more responsive. Panning is nice too, but don?t expect iPhone speeds. The browser cache works well and loading recently visited pages is very quick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s good news for Flash support too (sort of) ? YouTube works, most other (less popular) video sharing sites - don?t. Other restrictions still apply ? you can open links in new window by will, no text copying, no text reflow (which means you don?t have much choice of zoom levels).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kinetic scrolling has little momentum so don?t count on getting end to end with one sweep and instead of minimap you just get an Overview. At least it?s better than the buggy minimap on the Samsung OmniaHD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s not much else to say about the S60 Browser on the Nokia 5800 ? it doesn?t have any major flaws but it?s not exactly a champion in any specific category either. A mid-table position fits this midrange handset (unlike certain high-end phones that left us very disappointed).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Opera Mini 4.2 on HTC HD2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Opera Mini is the most popular feature phone browser. It?s also widely used on smartphones because the Opera servers compress the page before sending it to the phone. It crunches most pages down to 80KB from 500KB+. Plus it works on both touch enabled phones and non-touch handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because pages are reflowed so they look better on small screens (as little as 2?), the layout suffers. The reflow algorithm has problems handling complex pages. JavaScript support is also very limited ? only a small subset is supported. The lack of proper zooming is also an issue and the text size setting only has options that are either too small or too big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s only one zoom level and overview for navigation and while it will search for text on a page, it won?t copy it. Download works only for pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the browser does fine in address suggestion and syncs with Opera Link.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One annoying bug we spotted is that on the HTC HD2, the backspace key on the onscreen keyboard didn?t work ? you have to use the virtual ?Delete? key, which can be quite confusing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upcoming version ? Opera Mini 5 ? is in its second beta (which is why it?s not included in this test) and promises quite a number of enhancements: higher speed, tabs, text copy, speed dial and a download manager to name a few. It?s stable enough to work with, but if you want to play it safe, wait till Opera releases the final version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So there you have it ? the touch-driven browsers are all pretty good and even the worst of them will do a decent job of browsing on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None of the contenders is perfect just yet so there is room for improvement. You should choose your favorite based on the compromises you are ready to make. Not everybody needs Flash or pinch-zooming or even a download manager for that matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that?s exactly the reason why we won?t announce a winner here. It all depends on how you use your device or what type of web content you consume on a daily basis. We told you the story and there?s the table too to make sure you find the browser that ticks the right boxes.</paragraph>
