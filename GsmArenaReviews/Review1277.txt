			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The last thing you need is one that looks exactly like your ex. On a second thought, it's too early perhaps to end it. You two did look great together, your iPhone 4 and you. In fact you still do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iPhone 4S owners, this is between you and your phone's inner voice - Siri. iPhone 4 owners, this is between you and your inner voice. Yes, we know your inner voice is telling you to go for the NEXT iPhone. And no, we're not telling you not to listen to it. Just hang on. Maybe this review will help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's go back and start at the beginning. Every year, a new iPhone is raising the bar for the industry. Usually, it's half a point up - a full point on special occasions. The iPhone 4 was such a special occasion. The iPhone 4S is the half-point type. There probably is nothing special about it. At least, not on the outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, we didn't mean that. The iPhone 4S is still one of the best looking smartphones we've seen. There's just nothing new on the outside to suggest the amount of work done on the innards. And the iOS 5 is only half of the story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S is promoted to the dual-core league and has more powerful graphics. There's a major boost to imaging too, with 8MP stills and 1080p video. And on top of it all, Apple try to take voice recognition to a new level with Siri. All in all, the iPhone 4S is a completely different phone under the hood. A brand new device that has been developed for months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, it?s a phone you've already seen. You probably have it in the pocket as we speak. And the list of cons does sound familiar, doesn't it? Ah, there you go. We knew you?d notice. The last thing Apple needed was another Antennagate ? and as far as we can tell, they?ve had it sorted out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple will probably let this one slip by with a shy, almost apologetic, ?Don?t mention it?. But they?ll certainly feel entitled to at least some gratitude for the other stuff in the new iPhone 4S. Things like the dual core CPU and upgraded GPU, iOS 5 and iCloud integration, the new cameraphone credentials and Siri, the she-Jeeves of the digital age.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S is here, and ready for our traditional hardware checkup. Follow us on the next page where we intend to fast-forward through the familiar design. Just don?t put money on it. It?s a phone we may fall back in love with before we know it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Apple iPhone 4S<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No surprises with the packaging. As usual, the box is barely bigger than the iPhone 4S itself and has room for just the bare essentials. We found the usual charger, a USB cable and the same set of 3.5mm earphones as the one we got with the 3GS and the iPhone 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Amidst the booklets (an iPhone 4S brochure and product guide) there are the SIM eject tool and a couple of Apple logo stickers. That?s that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We though we'd find the newly announced microUSB adapter in our European retail package, but there?s no such thing. We wonder what the EU commission has to say about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 4S 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S has exactly the same size and styling as its predecessor. It's still one of the best-looking smartphones we?ve seen. The impressively slim handset measures 115.2 x 58.6 x 9.3 mm and has put on only 3 grams of weight as compared to the iPhone 4.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Retina display - we know you want one<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4 had probably the best screen on the market in June 2010. Of course Super AMOLED?s and ClearBlack?s had a thing or two to say, but the LED-backlit IPS Retina screen had the highest resolution at 960 x 640 and eye-popping pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A year later, Super AMOLED screens are making their HD debut in the Samsung Galaxy Nexus we have the first HD display on a mobile phone. That?s obviously something for the iPhone 5 to try and best but the old Retina is still among the standard-setting screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re looking for hard arguments in favor of upgrading from an iPhone 4, the display is not one of them. But the honest truth is few can match the Retina for its crisp graphics, vibrant colors, deep blacks and remarkable sunlight legibility and viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's our Retina display brightness test:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alright, Apple may?ve raised their own bar too high with the Retina display, but we think they?ve got an even bigger worry. Improving a screen is a game of numbers. If all else fails, up the resolution. But what about something intangible and elusive like personality and good looks. They?re in for a massive challenge with the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it?s all their fault. We think it?s next to impossible to repeat the iPhone 4 magic. But go ahead, prove us wrong, Apple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s been more than a year and we still find the iPhone 4 hard to resist. One of the most minimalist phone designs is one of the most compelling. Of course, there is a flipside. The handling is a bit tricky, so be careful at least in the beginning. The finish just doesn?t allow as secure a grip. The glass back is relatively resistant to scratches but unlikely to survive drops. The design has a weak spot - four of them actually - the corners. And the antenna issues were embarrassing, to say the least. The good thing is they?ve been sorted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end though, the iPhone 4S is nothing short of beautiful. Fifteen months and counting, and very few flagships have been able to come close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's get back to work though and put things into a more practical perspective. Although it?s virtually the same design, some of the old iPhone 4 accessories won?t fit the 4S. The Mute button is the reason, it?s slightly offset compared to the iPhone 4, but it?s just the same as on the iPhone 4 for Verizon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s have a closer look at the iPhone 4S then shall, we? There is nothing surprising at the front. The VGA back facing camera and the earpiece are above the screen, with hidden proximity and ambient light sensors in the vicinity, The round Home button is below the display doing its usual job of closing apps and opening the multi-tasking bar. It now launches the Siri virtual assistant too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Apple iPhone 4S has the usual Ring/Silent switch and the two round volume control knobs. In iOS 5 the volume up key doubles as a camera shutter too. This part of the iPhone 4S is the main reason your old case may not fit ? the Mute key has been moved a few millimeters down, the volume keys have moved a millimeter too. We guess the new antenna design might have something to do with that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side is the microSIM card slot. To open it you'll need the enclosed SIM eject tool. A paper clip or a pin would do too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top is where the Sleep/Wake button is, as well as the standard 3.5mm audio jack. There is an extra mic too used for the active noise cancelation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S has the proprietary Apple USB cable/charger/dock connector at the bottom, as well as a tiny loudspeaker grill and mouthpiece either side of the connectivity port. No stereo speakers, yet again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear features the 8 megapixel camera lens and the single LED flash. The iPhone 4S Li-Po battery has been upgraded to 1430mAh and is non user replaceable. There is no microSD card slot either, not that we expected to see one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One last change to mention is the antenna design. Speaking of which, the bumper cases are no longer needed other than for protection. Apple learned their lesson from the iPhone 4 and while the iPhone 4S looks practically the same, it features two antennas to combat the "death grip" issue. Note that we don?t mean the dual GSM / CDMA radios. It?s actually two separate antennas, each of which support both standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone can intelligently switch between the two as needed (even in the middle of a call), so if one antenna is blocked, the other takes over. This means no death grip, no matter how you hold the iPhone 4S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the SAR values have gone up and are twice as high on the iPhone 4S. Those are still within the accepted standards for these sorts of things, but it?s something that?s worth noting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we know for sure is the iOS 5 is not skimping on the upgrades. A beautiful phone has just become better and faster. Twice faster at times, which was really impressive. The iPhone 4 is nowhere near sluggish but it?s good to know you have the extra torque when needed. And last but not least, the iPhone 4S finally makes the A-list with 8MP stills and Full HD videos. We?ve got a dual-core smartphone and a full fledged cameraphone waiting in the lab. Let?s not keep it idle.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>iOS 5 on iPhone 4S<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have a comprehensive review of the iOS 5, which we tested on an iPhone 4. There's nothing dramatically different on the iPhone 4S, except you get two things that won't work on the iPhone 4. One is the Siri virtual assistant and the other is dictation support. Across almost the entire interface, text entry can be based on voice-recognition - you can dictate instead of type. That's it as far as the iPhone 4S exclusive software goes. And in case you've missed our iOS 5 review, this review tries to cover everything there is to know about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Simplicity is the philosophy of the iOS. You have a homescreen and apps, no layer upon layer of advanced menus hidden deep. The Settings is the only place where you'll find sub-menus. Basically, the way you interact with the device isn't different to what we saw a few years back in the first iPhone. And we can still safely call it the standard-setting touchscreen interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, that's where the iOS 5 starts. Let's see where it's heading. Apple say it rings more than 200 new features. We didn't bother counting, but the really interesting things amount to at least 40.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There have been virtually no visual changes to the core interface. In terms of design, the only new thing you'll notice around the Settings menu is the new look of the toggle switches ? they're now circles instead of squares.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To go straight to one of the most important novelties though - the iOS 5 has a new approach to Notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users receive notifications both on the lockscreen and on the homescreen - and there's a pull-down Notification center a la Android. You can set the behavior for each notification: view in Notification Center on/off, view on Lock Screen on/off, Badge icon on/off, number of shown items 1/5/10 and alert style - off/banner/pop-up alert.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The system is pretty flexible and configurable now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications display on the lockscreen too and they're active. When you respond to a notification by sliding it across the screen, it will take relevant action (return a missed call) or launch the appropriate app. Not bad at all, but not perfect either - if you have more than one missed event. Let's say you have a new email and a missed call notified on the lockscreen. You decide to return the call and when you're finished you go back to the lockscreen to find nothing. A minor thing, but not typical of Apple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen notifications (or any app screen for that matter) can be displayed in two ways - as a banner at the top of the screen or as a pop-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification banner at the top stays on for a few seconds and then disappears. If you tap on it you will be taken to the relevant app. The pop-up alert appears at the center of the screen and has two buttons - View and Dismiss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the pull-down Notification Center works just like the Android notifications. You can access the Notification Center from anywhere in the interface. If you are in an app, let's say a game, if you accidentally swipe near the notification area, you won't open the notification center, but just a small virtual handle. If you do need to access the Notification Center, you'll have to pull it down using that handle. It does pause the app beneath, so there?s no way you accidentally stray off the road while playing Real Racing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center displays all your pending alerts. You can enable/disable and rearrange the alerts in the Notification settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center supports widgets too. Currently there are only two to choose from - Weather and Stocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has added dictionary support working in all the native iOS apps such as Safari, Mail, Notes, etc. If you tap and hold on a word and then choose Define from the popup balloon, you'll be redirected to word definition in the integrated iOS dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dictionary is not a stand-alone app, it works just when you select a word.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two more things we need to mention related to the general interface. The first one is the dedicated Camera shortcut on the lockscreen. You can bring it up the same way you invoke the music controls - with a double click of the Home button. The camera key appears right next to the Unlock slider and will launch the Camera app when tapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing is the Newsstand app on your homescreen, which displays as a homescreen folder. All the periodicals you buy at the App Store will go there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we conclude our user interface section with some performance notes. You must've already seen the iPhone 4 vs. 4S head-to-head article. Anyway, to summarize, the iPhone 4S is at times almost twice as fast as its predecessor is when it comes to CPU and seven times faster (Apple didn?t lie about this) when it comes to 3D performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results of our benchmarks:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook - same look, adds Related People field and custom sound alerts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has seen almost no changes and still has no smart dialing (you have the system wide Spotlight search for that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is the same simple and easy to use app, down to the usual alphabet search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new thing is the Related people field in the phonebook. You can identify your contacts with labels such as mother, father, parent, brother, sister, child, friend, spouse, partner, assistant, manager, etc. Do have in mind though that all the labels are available only for the native iPhone contacts. With a set of Google-synced contacts only three labels were supported: spouse, assistant and manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a new Social Profile field too. You can use it to save Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, LinkdIn and MySpace account names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new thing about the telephony on iOS is that mail, voicemail, calendar and reminder sound alerts are customizable, finally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you don?t like the provided ringtones and you don?t know how to make one yourself, you can now choose Buy More Tones directly in the sound settings. You will be redirected to the iTunes Tone Store (the iTunes app) and you can buy whatever tones you like there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FaceTime also gets a new feature. If your carrier does not support FaceTime activation by phone number, you can use your email as ID. It's done automatically if the phone number activation fails. Just make sure you are connected to a Wi-Fi network and turn the FaceTime on in Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also choose your FaceTime ID - even if you use email activation, you could still use your mobile phone number for identification.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony - better loudspeaker, no antenna issues, CMDA is onboard too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>First things first: dropped calls are so 2010. A dual antenna setup gets rid of the death grip issue. The phone can intelligently switch between the two antennas as needed (even in the middle of a call), so if one antenna is blocked, the other takes over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only is there no wrong way to hold the phone, the overall reception seems a lot better now. We repeated our tests from last year. We made a few calls from a residential area of really poor coverage and while the iPhone 4 barely held to signal, much like any other phone we?ve tested, the iPhone 4S (working on the same network) showed at least 2 to 3 bars. There were. No dropped calls, no voice drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should note that according to Apple the iPhone 4S has double the SAR values of the previous iPhones, but within safety levels. We guess that's the price to pay for the excellent reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've probably heard the iPhone 4S is a world phone working on both CDMA and GSM networks. This works only one way though. CDMA is only available on handsets activated for use on a CDMA network. If you bought your iPhone with a GSM SIM card it won't support CDMA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker performs better than on the iPhone 4, although not a massive improvement. It scored Average in our traditional loudspeaker test, while all the iPhone 4 had a Below Average result. The results are similar to what we saw on the iPad 2, we guess both devices use the same speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, although the iPhone 4 and 4S score equal in the pink noise and the music/voice tests, the 4S sounds richer and deeper. In the ringtone test there is an increase of up to 8db.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FaceTime video calling over Wi-Fi is enabled on the iPhone 4S of course. The iPhone 4, iPad 2 and the new generation of Macs, as well as the last-gen iPod Touch are the compatible devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iMessage service - free messaged between all supported iOS devices<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging app stores all your messages within threads and offers options for mass delete and forwarding. There is a search field, MMS support (if you choose to attach a multimedia file) and character counter. The SMS delivery reports are still missing though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 5 keeps the simple and intuitive interface but brings a functionality boost with the iMessage service. The iMessage service lets you exchange instant messages between iOS 5-running iGadgets via Wi-Fi or 3G. You can send plain text as well as multimedia (pictures, sounds, videos) messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To activate the iMessage you just need to go to Settings-&gt;Messages and turn it on. But how does it work?</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You tap on the new message button and you'll see the standard message composer with a green SEND key. When you choose a recipient you'll notice a small loading icon right next to the name. If the person you are texting has the iMessage service, your SEND key will turn blue and the top bar will say New iMessage instead of New Message. Yes, it?s all automatic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty simple - you type, you add content (optional) and hit send. The iMessage conversations are color-coded to differ from the standard SMS/MMS - their bubbles are blue instead of green.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iMessage service is essentially an IM - in an iMessage conversation you can see when the other person is typing and you get their messages instantly. You can also get Read Receipts ? something they still don?t offer in the usual SMS app. Go figure!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One more thing about iMessage - your ID is either your phone number or your email - just as in FaceTime.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New Mail app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Mail app gets a few tweaks of its own. It supports multiple email accounts (configurable in the Settings app) and offers Universal Inbox (showing all your mail at once). The Mail app also supports threads, email archiving and quick lookup of documents thanks to the integrated doc viewer. There is also an Open With? option, offerings depending on what you have installed (PDF reader, mobile office, iBooks, etc).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you open your Inbox and hit the Edit button, you now have a Mark key alongside Move and Delete. You can now mass mark emails as read/unread or flag them as important. Unfortunately, a "Select All" option is still missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bold, Italic and Underline font styles are added to the text editing options as well as quote font size levels. Text selection works the usual way (tap&amp;hold&amp;select) and the available options will appear as soon you've made the selection: Cut/Copy/Replace/Bold Italic Underline/Quote Level. Quote Level will increase / decrease the quote symbols before the text you're quoting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add or delete Mail folders now - just hit the Edit button when you explore the email account.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is a pleasure to work with<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone?s gallery (called Photos) is rather simple and easy to work with. It hosts all you pictures organized in different albums or tabs. When you open a specific album you can swipe scroll through the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one thing you should know. The iPhone's gallery opens every image slightly zoomed in to fit the whole screen tight. If you want to view the actual size picture, you?d need to pinch or double-tap to zoom out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery syncs tightly with Mac OS X's iPhoto, to let you upload your Events, Places and Faces folder to your iPhone. They will appear as tabs at the bottom of the main Photos page. If your photos are geotagged, the Places tab will appear automatically showing small pins on the map where you've taken pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app has a nifty photo editor. It enables rotation, cropping, and red-eye removal. There's also an enhance option over which you have no control - it's all automatic. In Edit mode four keys appear at the bottom for the available editing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recorded clips are also stored in the Photos app and can be trimmed straight on the phone. It?s as basic as it gets: there is a thumbable filmstrip at the top for you to set the start and end of the cut. You can quickly preview the part of the clip you?re about to trim. But the best thing is you can overwrite your current clip or save it as a new one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can edit movies with iMovie too, but it?s a paid app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The iPod is now called Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPod music player is now called just Music and comes with a brand new icon. As everything within the iOS, the Music app is as simple as it gets. It has five tabs at the bottom - Playlists, Artists, Songs, Albums and More.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available across the Music app, as well as Shuffle. You can create, edit and delete playlists; you can delete tracks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you turn the iPhone landscape, you'll get the Cover Flow view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the More tab you'll find your downloaded podcasts, audiobooks and more sorting options: by genre, compilations or composers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player offers a few equalizer presets and you can find them in the Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few helpful tips about the Music app. When your screen is locked you can get music shortcuts with just a double tap on the Home key. If you use the headset, double click on the middle key plays next song, while the triple click goes to the previous track. A single click on the middle click pauses/continues your current song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three ways to manage your music on the iPhone - on a computer with iTunes, direct purchase in the iTunes app on your iPhone, or iCloud sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a computer with the iTunes software you can create playlists and sync them with your iPhone. It has to be one computer though - each new computer sync will overwrite your old music library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you buy songs directly on your iPhone (via the iTunes Store), you can either sync them with your computer or download them again when you log in with the Apple ID you bought them with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third way is the iCloud. If your Music sync is turned on, then you can always download your music library (whatever the reason - restore, new device, deleted, etc.). We'll talk more about the iCoud sync and iTunes match later.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player plays 1080p, but has poor codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone has a separate Video app to hold all of your videos. The video playing interface is very simple, with nothing more than the usual player controls (including Fit to Screen) and a scrubber for precise skipping back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Supported video formats are not too many and as you probably already know, DivX and XviD videos are out of the quiestion. The nice thing about the iPhone 4S is that it can easily play 1080p videos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Best audio quality in business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you want to have the best possible audio output on your cell phone get an iPhone. The rule has always been as simple as that and the iPhone 4S is no exception to it. The new iOS smartphone did great in both the headphones off and headphones on parts of our test, achieving some pretty great scores and remaining impressively loud all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the first trial (connected to an active external amplifier), the iPhone 4S performed marvelously, but that's hardly a surprise. Even less talented smartphone musicians can get good scores here, so we couldn't expected anything less than perfect from the iPod descendant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What really puts the iPhone 4S in a class of its own (not counting its predecessors, of course) is its headphones-on performance. The minor jump in stereo crosstalk is all that our lab equipment was able to detect as the resistance to the line-out port increased. The rest of the readings remained virtually unchanged, rounding up a really impressive performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Amazing 8 megapixel camera and 1080p camcorder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 4S has an 8 megapixel camera for maximum image resolution of up to 3264 x 2448 pixels. There is a LED flash too, which may even make more difference than usual given the back-illuminated camera sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new back-illuminated sensor with 5-element lens, F/2.4 aperture is made by Sony. The things to expect of all this tech are better colors, better noise performance, more sharpness and more precise white balance. There is face detection and HDR, as well as an AE/AF lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple claim the iPhone 4S camera needs just 1.1 seconds to take its first photo and just half a second between shots. We can now confirm this - the iPhone 4S still camera is the fastest we've seen so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is pretty much the same as before with a few options added on the viewfinder - a viewfinder grid, an HDR setting, pinching gesture for digital zoom and swipe gesture for quick gallery access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now use the Volume Up key (both on the device and the headset) as a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple have added an AE/AF lock: tap and hold for 2 seconds on an object in the scene to keep it properly exposed and focused in a series of shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One last thing we found, which Apple didn't quite give enough credit in their elaborate presentation, is that a swipe to the right on the camera viewfinder opens the last picture taken. A swipe to the left in turn brings back the camera's live view instantly. Perhaps the reason for laying low on this one is that it?s a blatant rip-off of the Windows Phone 7 camera app. A neat feature nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here comes the best part - the image quality. The iPhone 4S has a strong claim on being the best 8 megapixel cameraphone. We're impressed by the amount of detail even in the shadows and the background. The colors are vibrant and accurate, there are no artifacts. There's plenty of praise we can give these pictures, but it's better to just go ahead and see for yourselves. Enjoy!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S camera samples have less noise and higher dynamic range than the iPhone 4. It's hard to really find anything to question about the iPhone 4S camera.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 4S in our Photo Compare Tool. You can see the iPhone 4S getting the upper hand over the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S II, the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc and Arc S, among other high-end droids. It's also better than the recently released Nokia N9.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let's say it again: amazing Full HD videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S records 1080p videos and the clips are stored in .MOV format with a mommoth 23Mbps bitrate (or even higher). Videos are shot at a smooth 30fps most of the time but he framerate drops to 26fps when the lighting isn't good (videos shot in the dark still turn out very good).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is remarkable and, like in the still camera department, the iPhone 4S beats even the Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One letdown is that videos have mono sound (64Kbps@44.1kHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The framerate is very consistent, with lots of resolved detail and pleasing colors. We found no glitches or artifacts in the video and, believe us, we looked really hard. The iPhone 4S camcorder has continuous auto-focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something is missing though and we don't mean SloMo or Time Lapse videos. It's as simple as a lower resolution setting, 720p for example. Sometimes you just want a quick shot of something as a reminder or for later reference - it doesn't have to be in brilliant full HD. It should be no problem to store and should agree with even basic players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are MMS-grade videos at 480 x 360 and probably you can downscale a Full HD video to 720p in iMovie. But it couldn't have been that hard to give users a choice and put a 720p quality setting in the camcorder. Just to give you things in perspective, a 10-minute video takes up something like 1.8GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The swipe gesture to reveal the gallery works here too and the camcorder interface is even simpler than the still camera's. There just two settings - turn the flash on/off and switch to the FaceTime camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AE/AF lock is available as well - it needs a tap and hold on the screen to lock focus and exposure on a specific part of the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all - the faster processor in the iPhone 4S has allowed Apple to enable real-time stabilization. We did a quick test of the video stabilization - check out the side-by-side video:.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two videos were shot with an iPhone 4 and a 4S, both fixed to the same stand held in the hand, so each gets shaken equally. The stabilization does an impressive job, considering it's in real time. Note that it may introduce some geometric distortion though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way if you pan between brighter and darker areas or an object fills a lot of the frame and then moves out, there would be no sudden changes in focus and exposition (which can be really annoying in some videos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to the actual video quality, it takes a capable enough computer and a 1080p screen to appreciate this 1080p sample video (10s, 31MB). These videos are impressive in size too - 10 minutes of video take up a whopping 1.6GB chunk (or bigger) of the iPhone?s non-expandable memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an YouTube video as well. Just don?t forget to hit 1080p in the menu.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: GSM, CDMA, no NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S has the power-efficient Bluetooth 4.0. It has lower latency and higher range, but doesn?t have the bandwidth for bulk data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, gadgets like the Nike+ can really benefit from BT4.0 ? there?s barely any data to transfer but improving battery life is a huge plus. BT4.0 is also intended to work as electronic leash, wireless lock, various types of heart-rate sensors and such. Things like wireless keyboards will probably get in on the action too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the up side, the new MacBook Airs and Minis support Bluetooth 4.0, so a good portion of the iPhone 4S buyers will already have a Bluetooth 4.0 enabled device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, adoption of BT4.0 is pretty low. NFC isn?t moving very fast either, but Nokia has vowed to include it in all their phones (and they still have plenty of market share) and Samsung is including it in some of their devices, with some carriers eager to use it. Credit card companies are joining in too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll see how it goes, Apple certainly is a trend-setter, but it?ll have to start from the ground up. We are guessing Bluetooth 4.0 will be big with accessories, but won?t eat into on NFC?s territory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth file transfers are still not available. Peer-to-peer connections over Wi-Fi, and even Bluetooth, are a way around this but they only work between iPhones and via third-party apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest iPhone 4S supports Wi-Fi b/g/n standards, as well as Wi-Fi hotspot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tethering over USB or Bluetooth is also enabled. Just hit the on switch and choose connection type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S has quad-band GSM and HSPA support, with download speed of up to 14.4 Mbps and up to 5.8 Mbps for upload. It's touted as a world phone with a dual antenna setup capable of working under both GSM and CDMA (CDMA 800/1900 and CDMA2000 1xEV-DO). And no, there is no LTE support. The truth is, if you?ve bought and activated your iPhone 4S with a GSM operator, you won?t be able to roam in CDMA networks. Only iPhone 4S?s activated with a CDMA carrier will be able to roam in GSM carriers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wired connectivity package offers a 3.5mm standard audio jack and Apple's proprietary 30-pin connectivity port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although Apple announced a microUSB adapter, it wasn't supplied in the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Safari is faster and comes with Safari Reader<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 5?s Safari browser has been updated too. Of course it inherits all the previous upgrades from the iOS 3.0: auto-fill and password manager, Copy Link and Open in New Page options, as well as the iOS 4's Google and bookmark suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser is another area where the iPhone 4S flexes muscle. Readings for both raw JavaScript performance (SunSpider) and the JavaScript + HTML performance (BrowserMark) are through the roof, with Android dual-cores lagging behind. We'll chalk that up to Apple's software genius, as the CPU alone can't account for the performance gap we're seeing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few new handy features - the Private Browsing option and Reader mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Safari now offers a Private Browsing option in the settings (Settings-&gt;Safari). If you turn it on, nothing you do on the bowser will leave a trail in your phone - no browsing history, no search history, no usernames or passwords, etc. The only thing nicer than the Private Browsing itself would've been a dedicated key in the browser UI, instead of a lonely toggle in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the advanced settings you can find very detailed web browsing data and delete all of it or some specific site-related data only (such as Google Search).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now let's talk about the best part so far - the integrated Reader. If a page is compatible with the Reader (most of the article pages out there are) you get the new Reader button right into the address bar as soon as the page loads. If you activate it, you'll get a clean view of the article you are reading - only text and the article-related pictures. There are no ads, no navigation controls, nothing beyond the important stuff. And best of all, getting from one page to the next is automatic as soon as you scroll to the bottom of the previous one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the font size via two font controls at the top. You can also select a word and choose Define - the iOS 5 integrated Dictionary will open with the meaning of the word.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you open a multi-page article (like this review) the Reader will detect it and will load the next page when you reach the bottom of the current.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also make bookmarks of Reader pages - they are added into the Reader List for later reading. Note that the page is not saved for offline access, it's just a bookmark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Safari web browser is really fast on the iPhone 4S, with fluid scrolling and pinch-zooming, and excellent loading speeds. It does not support Flash, nor is it ever going to.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Twitter integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Social network integration has been a long-requested feature on iOS devices, but why limit it to Twitter only? Well, it?s the Apple way or the highway. Now about that Twitter integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a separate Twitter tab in Settings. You can sync your Twitter contacts with the phonebook or you can search your existing contacts for matching Twitter ID?s. Another addition is a Tweet option in the Share menus across the UI (Maps, YouTube, Safari, etc.) next to Email, Print, MMS, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Are we the only ones that find this popup way too big already? Just kidding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manage multiple Twitter accounts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Find My Friends app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Find My Friends app, that was announced a week ago at the Let's Talk iPhone event, has also become available into the Apple App Store. It is free and compatible with both the iPhone/iPod and iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app lets you always share your current location with friends or temporarily with less trusted contacts. It works both ways - you can see your friends' location too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app offers a few options - locate a friend on the map and get directions to them (redirecting you to the Maps app though). The Find My Friends app interface also shows you the distance between you and your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to hide your location when needed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reminders<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has included a brand new app with the new iOS 5 - Reminders. It?s as simple as it name suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reminders app has a pretty simple interface doing really some basic but important stuff. There are two viewing options - by date or a list. Both of them open on a Completed list first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the List view you have the option to add different lists - the default one is the events on your phone. But you can add lists for iCloud or Gmail reminders for example. All lists appear as different panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have chosen the List view, you have only 2 panes to work with - the Completed list and one pane for all of your reminders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing by date gives you lots of panes - you start with Completed and then you have a pane for each day. You also get a Calendar shortcut, to easily select the day you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you create a new reminder, you must first type its name directly on the pane and click Done. After that you are able to edit (just tap on it) - you can choose the Type of reminder - by date or location, Due option, Priority and to which list it will belong (iPhone, iCloud, Gmail etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to be reminded on the day of the event, you just choose date and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A novel feature is the location-aware reminder. You can choose a location in your phonebook or your current location (why not Gmaps, it beats us!) and then you choose whether you like the reminder to activate on on arrival or departure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a reminder sets off, you see it as a standard notification - on your lockscreen, the Notification Center and the homescreen (as a banner or a pop-up).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The few default apps aren?t enough to make the iPhone the ultimate organizer, but with every iOS they tend to get better and will do well to get you started ? the AppStore will take care of the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS calendar looks much like its average competitors ? you can create and sync different calendars (Google and Outlook for example). Then you can add various events with alerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the calendar has got a brand new weekly view, you just have to turn your iPhone in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typical Notes, Calculator, Voice Recorder, Stock and Weather apps are onboard too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather app got hourly forecast, just tap on the weather pane and it will reveal itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Clock app you also get a World Clock, Alarm, Stopwatch and Timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple?s iBooks app is not pre-installed, but you can get it for free from the AppStore. This e-reading app comes with one complimentary book ? Winnie The Pooh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iBooks offers various font and color settings, but on a screen this size, it?s just not the best e-reading experience. Pages are side-scrollable only and on a mobile phone that doesn?t quite make sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iBooks app is also a PDF viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally there is the mobile YouTube app to make up for the missing Flash video support.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Storage management and App Store purchase list<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can find the Purchased list in the App Store's Updates section. It has two tabs - All and Not On This iPhone. It's the easiest way to again download an app that you purchased and uninstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that this list is available on the iOS 4 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's talk about the Storage Management. You can find it in Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Usage menu. Here you now have storage information too, before the Battery Percentage toggle and the statistics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Storage part begins with Free and Used space info and then you have a list of your ten biggest apps and their memory footprint - usually the Music and some heavy games such as Infinity Blade. You can access all of your installed apps via the dedicated button at the end of the top 10 list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on an app in the list will show the data footprint (default app, saves, etc.) but the clean data option is now gone (it was available in the beta versions). You can still uninstall the whole app from there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wireless activation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Perhaps this is where most of Apple's efforts went. Many are probably put off by the dependence on iTunes. Well, Apple has finally made this a bit easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You no longer need a computer to activate your iGadget. The moment you turn on your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch for the first time, you can do the activation and setup process right on your device (a network connection is required of course). After a few simple steps, quite similar to Android's initiation process, you are good to go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>OTA updates<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You no longer need a computer connection and iTunes to install new firmware updates either. Now you can do it over-the-air. The option is in Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Software Update. Of course, you can still use iTunes on your Mac/PC to do that if your Wi-Fi connection is too slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And thanks to the use of Delta encoding, the updates will now come with a much smaller footprint than before when they carried a whole system image. The new update files carry only the bits that need changing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The OTA updates</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wi-Fi iTunes sync<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In case you choose to rely on the traditional computer-based iTunes sync, you will be happy to know Apple has now provided an option to sync wirelessly. You just need to have your iGadget and your PC/Mac connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Make sure you've enabled the Wi-Fi sync option in your iTunes client and your iGadget is connected with a cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wireless wync runs automatically as soon as you plug your device to charge and you open the iTunes client on your Wi-Fi connected computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty in the PC/Mac iTunes sync, is that it no longer locks your device during the process. You can continue to use your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch during the sync process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you choose to use the iCloud, the only one thing that you may ever need the desktop iTunes is for using the USB mass storage functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Accessibility gets better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Improved accessibility goes beyond the Voice Over, Zooming, UI color switch, etc. The iPhone can now use the LED flash for alerts and you can assign and even create custom vibration alerts to specific events or contacts ? much like you would assign a personalized ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Assistive Touch is another useful feature. By activating it you get a new on-screen key that stays available throughout the UI, even on the lockscreen and in games. It?s shaped as a homescreen icon and offers a few useful menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily move the key in one of the four corners of the screen at any time. Tapping on it reveals four shortcuts ? Gestures, Device, Home, Favorites. Every shortcut, except the Home key, opens another submenu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gestures shortuct allows you to simulate two, three, four or five-finger tap. The Device shortcut will allows you to rotate the screen (if available), lock the screen, use the volume controls and even simulate a device shake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Favorites section you have a Pinch gesture shortcut and you can additionally assign six more custom gestures. You just need to perform them once so the iOS can save them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home virtual key has the same functionality as the hardware Home ? you can single/double/triple click it for the relevant commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Assistive Touch is a pure accessibility option that helps you control everything in the iOS with let?s say just one finger.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Say "Hi" to Siri<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you've undoubtedly heard (and seen) Siri, the personal digital assistant that lives in the iPhone 4S, is really amazing. It listens to your spoken questions and answers back in its own voice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's impressively versatile: you can request information (weather, stock, points of interest, you name it) or ask it to perform tasks for you - set an alarm, add a calendar entry, compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple even gave it a bit of an attitude, so when you ask something silly (as you surely will), Siri comes back with a witty reply and a grin on its face. The practical value of such jokes is zero, but it really gives the user a sense that they are speaking to something intelligent rather than something that knows some answers by rote. And Apple are adding new jokes on the Siri servers, because we discovered a few new ones since the iPhone 4S launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we are sure Apple is adding more helpful answers too, but we are sure most of the users are currently using Siri mostly for fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should keep in mind that Siri loses a good deal of its usability outside the US as it can't search for nearby points of interests and businesses. It also supports a limited number of languages and if you think your TOEFL English will cut it, you may be wrong as Siri is very bad with accents. The UK English and French versions use a male voice, instead of female.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri can be helpful in many ways, and it's usually the important stuff it does well: reading out messages, scheduling appointments, reminders, and such, taking down notes, launching apps and carrying out searches, calling or sending messages to your contacts, etc. But voice recognition doesn't end there. Dictation support is another important part of the functionality. In any app involving text entry you can dictate instead of type. Press the Mic button on the keyboard and start dictating, whether it's a message body text, a search query, a calendar entry, a note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the bad news for iPhone 4 owners - Siri is not for you, just for the new iPhone 4S. Now, Apple says the service is in beta, so there's a chance that Siri will come to the iPhone 4 with an update somewhere down the line.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iCloud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, let's pay due attention to the iCloud. What is it, how you set it up and what you get?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud is Apple's cloud-based content management - the service, which comes free with iOS 5 will further reduce the need of a PC/Mac and iTunes. Effortless syncing and backup/restore - along with pushing content to all devices associated with your Apple ID.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and iCloud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Until now you synced all your apps on a single computer and its iTunes. If you had more than one iDevice you've done two (or more) separate sync processes. Well, this is no more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've probably noticed the new Purchased list already in the App Store's Update tab. Now Apple know exactly what apps you've purchased, what you have installed on an iDevice and what you have for some reason uninstalled. And they know this for each one of your iDevices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you chose to sync with iCloud, Apple will sync only the app's personal data, not the entire IPA file (as iTunes did). Here is an example:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Angry Birds installed on your iPhone. It has a save data of 1.5MB. Apple will only sync the save data in question. If you delete the game and install it again later (for free, from the Purchased list), your iPhone will download the original IPA off the App Store, complete with the save data - a lot more natural way to sync an app rather than keeping the whole image. Unfortunately, if you use an app as USB storage (a dedicated video player perhaps), the sync will try to back up the stored content as well (your video clips). That will quickly eat up your free iCloud allowance of 5GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing about the iCloud app sync - when you buy a new app, it will be pushed to all of your iDevices automatically (if available and if you have enabled this feature from the AppStore settings).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iCloud syncs everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iCloud is capable of syncing all your contacts, calendar events, books, photos and documents. The content will become available on all your iDevices automagically. The iCloud stores new photos automatically for 30 days, enough time to sync your other iGadgets too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iCloud offers free email at @me.com<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iCloud offers free me.com email that will also sync automatically across all your iDevices. You will be offered this when you activate the iCloud for the first time and the setup process is done in one easy step.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iTunes Match<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Music syncing is probably the trickiest part of the iCloud sync. Along with the tracks purchased from the iTunes store you surely have a collection of your own that you sync with your iOS device via iTunes. Well, Apple is now offering a service to sync both collections in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music you've purchased at the iTunes Store will be easy to sync automatically across all your iGadgets. But you will need to use the iTunes Match service for the rest of your music collection if you want it synced too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Match will scan your collection and check for matches with songs in the Apple's iTunes Store (currently 18+ million songs and growing). If there is a match, the iTunes song will be synced, if not - well, Apple will upload this song on their servers and then sync. Pretty cool, isn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the iTunes scans yours songs and push them to all your other devices if they match. If some of your tracks are of lower bitrate than 256Kbps, the iTunes Store will replace them with with higher quality (256Kbps) for you. The iMatch service costs $25 a year and will be first available in the US.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iCloud Backup and iCloud Restore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can back up your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch with the iCloud. It will store all of your settings and other important stuff, so if you need to restore wirelessly (if you got a new device for example) - it's the easiest way. The backup is automatic and is done every time your device is charging, locked and connected to a Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can restore your iGadget from iCloud, but first you need to connect it through iTunes, perform a standard restore procedure (downloading and reinstalling the iOS) and then chose the iCloud restore option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5GB of free storage, up to 55GB on a paid subscription<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple gives 5GB of free storage for iCloud sync. Now this may not sound enough, but actually it's more than enough. Your purchased music, apps and books don't count in this storage (except the app's personal data such as saves, settings, etc.). So the things that eat that storage are app's data, contacts, mail, photos, calendar events, backups and personal documents. Of course, there is an option to buy more iCloud storage - you can get 10GB additional storage (to those 5GB) for ?16 per year, 20GB more costs ?32/year or you could opt for 50GB additional storage to your free 5GB for ?80 per year. Refunds are available too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and a Compass comes by default<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s Google Maps again and it means the iPhone 4S doesn?t offer proper SatNav out of the box. You know what we?re gonna say next then ? AppStore. At least Google Maps have the benefit of a fully integrated magnetometer (digital compass).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year many full-featured sat-nav applications made their way to the App Store ? iGO, TomTom, Navigon, etc. Every one of them will do for the average Joe. A SatNav capable iPhone with a proper car kit is a good enough replacement of any standalone navigation solution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AppStore: still #1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The AppStore is the place to browse, buy and download all available third-party applications available for the iPhone platform. There are both free and paid apps with detailed descriptions and screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User ratings will help you decide which ones are worth it. There are also numerous web sites that do app reviewing with videos and everything, so you can get pretty much all the information on any of the available apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pick and download apps via iTunes and next time you sync your iPhone, you get all the applications on board. Since iTunes 9 you can also rearrange your homescreens using the desktop software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If for some reason you need to reset your iPhone, the licenses for the paid applications are not lost, and you can freely download and install them again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AppStore has an effective app update system to push all new goodies available for your currently installed software. If an app has been updated you will be notified with a red badge on the AppStore icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple AppStore is currently the largest official repository of apps with more than 500 000 titles available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Yesterday we decided not to stand between you and your desire to upgrade to the iPhone 4S. We got part of it wrong though. For true believers, getting the latest Apple tech is never about something as mundane. They don?t just upgrade, they get elevated to a new level of well-being and fulfillment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One would think the biggest problem of the iPhone 4S is that it isn't an iPhone 5. Go ahead and say it to a phone whose launch broke sales records and sent the bereaved company's stock soaring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But this is not what people should care about either. It's not the place for what ifs. The truth is Apple will really need to step on the Fast Forward button with the iPhone 5. A massive challenge - and they need time and a clear mind to do it right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not the right time for Apple to go for speeds that may throw them off course. It would be wrong though to look at the iPhone 4S as a mere time-buying move. In fact, the iPhone 4S has the right measure of Fast and Forward in it. And some of it is to be taken literally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4S is blazing fast on the new dual-core CPU and graphics chip. And by the way, this is a long-term asset - new apps and services will take advantage and they'll be exclusive to the 4S. The iPhone is finally up there with the industry's finest cameraphones too. In fact, it may well have the best 8MP stills and Full HD videos a mobile phone can produce. iOS 5 is busy making a difference too with the iCloud, iMessage, OTA updates, new notifications and voice recognition. On top of that you get the best app store and the brilliant looks of the original iPhone 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S II ? Google Galaxy Nexus ? Nokia N9</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add it all up, Apple have a smartphone that can match and even outclass formidable peers like the Samsung Galaxy S II, the Galaxy Nexus or the Nokia N9. In the US, it will be the likes of the HTC Amaze 4G and the Verizon DROID RAZR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Amaze 4G ? Motorola DROID RAZR</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For millions of people though it will be between the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S. Tough one we know. But hey, there's an app for that:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USER: Do you know a better phone than an iPhone 4S?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SIRI: Wait? there are other phones?</paragraph>
