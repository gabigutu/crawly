		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s devices like the Samsung Galaxy Gio that helped Android gain so much ground in so little time. They are a better bargain than the uber-smartphone and find their way into people?s pockets a lot easier. With that goal in mind, the Galaxy Gio must be an all-round pleaser of a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They may soon be running out of names for the Galaxy lot. But it will be when number plates start to fall short that they?ll know they?re in trouble. Back to the point though. Boy number S5660 is called Gio. He?s a teenager ? mischievous and fun, too young for a suit and tie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a decent offer for the midrange: with a good enough version of Android (2.2.1 Froyo), good enough screen, a powerful 800MHz processor and a great connectivity set, ranging from 3G to GPS. There?s little to complain about, save for the imaging skills perhaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s the rest of what the Galaxy Gio has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5660 Galaxy Gio obviously isn?t a camera-centric device. QVGA video and 3.2 MP stills don?t go a long way. But as a smartphone it has what it takes to be taken seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio is a phone of compromise. If you?re looking to give smartphones a try, you may be willing to live without a killer screen and a brilliant camera. The Gio will be a good choice for newbies or budget upgraders, if the price is right.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Galaxy S5660 Gio believes in smaller is better. The tiny box finds room for a microUSB cable and a charger, an SD-to-microSD adapter with 2GB worth of a complimentary card and some leaflets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The disappointing thing to note is the lack of headphones (European retail unit). We got wind that some regional versions will have a set enclosed (Asian), so it will obviously be a regional thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung tried to make amends with the 2GB microSD card but the headphones absence may not go down well with the end user.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Gio S5660 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio measures 110.5 x 57.5 x 12.2 mm and is entirely made of plastic, tipping the scales at the 102g mark. The edges of the device are nicely tapered, the phone feel slimmer and quite comfortable to hold as a result. Despite the all-plastic build the phone feels tight and well put together.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio doesn?t scream fashion. It?s a nice simple design that does well to stay away from black gloss and flashy color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Galaxy Ace, the Gio is lighter and more compact. It has lost a bit of screen estate but makes up for it with much friendlier size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is dominated by the 3.2? touchscreen of HVGA (320x480) resolution. It does well in terms of brightness and contrast. At the maximum brightness setting, the screen is brilliantly lit and the colors look nice and punchy. When you look at the screen from an angle you?ll immediately notice a difference. Colors get washed out and detail is quickly lost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is good though, the screen is not too reflective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as touchscreen response goes we have no complaints ? the screen is responsive without being overly sensitive (which can often result in unwanted taps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there is the proximity sensor that makes sure the screen gets locked during calls. There?s no ambient light sensor ? the display brightness can be adjusted manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s the typical set of keys at the bottom. The hardware home key is in the middle, with two capacitive controls on either side: Menu and Back. The keys designations are well backlit for comfortable use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This?s the layout of choice for Samsung?s Android phones. A notable exception is the Google Nexus S with its four capacitive keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left hand side of the Samsung Galaxy Gio S5660 there?re the lanyard eyelet and the volume rocker. The volume rocker key is quite thin but prominent enough to use comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power/Lock key is on the right (as on many Samsung phones), which makes it accessible with both the thumb of the right hand or the index finger of the left. A long press of the lock key will let you set Silent or Flight mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing on the right is the lid-covered microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the phone you?ll only find the 3.5 mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB port is at the bottom of the phone, used for both charging and data connections. USB charging off a computer is enabled too. There?s also a mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device reminds us of the Galaxy Ace, though with an important difference. The dot-patterned back of the Gio is smooth, not finely grooved like the Ace?s. Fingerprints are out of the question but the grip is not as good as the rubbery texture of the Ace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3MP camera lens is in the top left corner. There?s no LED flash and no lens protection either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing to note at the back is the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the battery cover is the SIM card compartment and the 1350mAh Li-ion battery. It?s quoted at 610 hours of standby (460 h in 3G) and up to 11 hours of talk time (6 h 40 min in 3G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5660 Galaxy is a phone of solid build and subtle styling. In a way it?s a lighter version of the Galaxy Ace ? would make sense to be less expensive too. After all you?re getting a smaller screen and a downgraded camera. The rest of the ingredients of a solid and reliable smartphone are there though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a market of ever-growing processing power and screen size, the Gio fits right in the middle ? safe from hard-hitting flagships. It?s a phone that can easily connect with its audience ? with a good feature set and sensible styling.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Froyo and TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio S5660 is powered by Android 2.2 Froyo and it?s enhanced by the Samsung TouchWiz user interface (or ?launcher?, in Android terms). There are four buttons docked at the bottom of the homescreen, which stay there even when you open the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a short video demo of the Galaxy Gio interface to get us started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The customizations start on the homescreen where you have up to seven panes to populate with widgets but you don?t have to use all the screens all the time. If you need less, deleting the extra ones will speed up navigation. You can zoom out with a pinch gesture to the enter edit mode,where you can add, remove and rearrange the homescreen panes as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area, one of the Android strong points, is the updated variety we saw on the Galaxy S Giorgio Armani - it has five switches for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, sound and rotation-lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the menu button on the homescreen and then selecting add will let you put more content on your homescreen homescreen (a press and hold on the homescreen does the same trick), add/delete homescreen panes or change the wallpaper. Live wallpapers are supported too, though there is only one preinstalled and you will have to get the rest from the market. The contextual menu has shortcuts too for search, notifications and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically the main menu consists of side-scrollable panes, much like the homescreen, instead of a vertical scrollable grid (like in the vanilla Android). List view is not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can edit the menu just like you do the homescreen: pinch to zoom out and you can add new or re-arrange the current menu panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu has an alternative edit mode, which lets you rearrange and uninstall applications (only those that you have installed and not the preinstalled ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting change in the Android 2.2-compatible version of Samsung?s TouchWiz launcher is the built-in task manager. Complete with a homescreen widget that shows the number of currently active apps, it saves you the need to install a task killer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some benchmarks of the Galaxy Gio and how it compares to Galaxy Ace:</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A TouchWiz-zed phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A typical Android smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy Gio has a phonebook with massive functionality and practically unlimited capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset displays the phone memory, SIM-stored and all Google contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you can have all your contacts gathered in one place. You can search the entries by either flick-scrolling the list or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen (courtesy of Samsung and the TouchWiz UI).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio also packs the quick contacts feature, which pioneered on Android 2.1. It lets you use the contact photo in the phonebook and call, text, or email the person with a single click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically multiple accounts for email and contact synchronization, including Exchange, are supported. There are many details that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right ? clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the main contact list, a swipe to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the message composer. The side-sweep thing is part of the TouchWiz UI and works in other lists too where you have names or numbers (such as the messaging menu).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio handled calls trouble-free. The reception and in-call sound were good and we didn?t experience any dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and works like a charm ? the implementation is the same as in every other recent Galaxy out there - it searches both contact numbers and names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is a tab within the dialer. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy Gio. It scored an Average mark. More info on the test itself as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS section is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook: a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the name or number and choose from the list of suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as edit, forward, delete and lock as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is easy. Adding multimedia content to a text message automatically turns into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or ? depending on your needs ? you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a generic email app as well for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have access to the original folders that are created online, along with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio features a combined inbox, which brings together all your mail in a single folder so you don?t need to check each one for new mail. This can be quite handy if you have lots of accounts and you just want to check if there is a new message needing your attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio comes with the Samsung home-baked keyboard preinstalled. It?s actually much more comfortable (and accurate!) than the often criticized stock Android QWERTY.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you flip the phone on its side, the virtual keyboard automatically switches to the landscape mode, which is much bigger and more comfortable to use. It covers most of the screen however, leaving room for only two lines of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input us also available and works quite good if you are in quieter environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the text input is enhanced by Swype ? we covered it thoroughly in the Samsung I9000 Galaxy S review and we won?t go into so much detail here. Swype is a life-saver on the smaller screens (such as the one of the Gio) ? you don?t have to be very accurate with your swyping, which makes text input faster and easier. It?s only that, much like with any other text prediction method, it has to support the language you want to enter text in.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A stock Android gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio comes with the stock Froyo gallery. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately (again) only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient ? just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you photos can be organized by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are checking out a photo, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back to the main gallery screen, without having to go through its folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to multi-touch support pinch zooming is also enabled on the Galaxy Gio but you can also double tap or use the +/- buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Bluetooth or MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The player on the Samsung Galaxy Gio can handle 3GP and MP4 video files. DivX/XviD support is missing, but at least we had no problems playing videos at up to WVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos wouldn?t play, but that?s overkill on a HVGA display anyway. But you?re not limited to the Galaxy Gio display. Thanks to DLNA you can view photos and videos on compatible hardware ? like TVs or computers with the right software (the latest version of Windows Media player for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface itself is as simple and as it could possibly be ? there almost isn?t one. You can use the Gallery or the My Files app to browse videos. The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons as well as a scrollable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio has the TouchWiz music player. The sorting options are displayed in a tabbed interface: current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove some of the filters to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Samsung have enabled equalizer presets on the Galaxy Gio along with DNSe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search is also available. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album. What?s even better, the YouTube search results are loaded straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing missing is the fancy Disc View from the Galaxy S lineup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 4 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset still needs to be plugged in to act as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Gio S5660 did pretty well in our traditional audio output quality test. The smartphone is pretty impressive when used with an active external amplifier and even if you plug in a pair of headphones, things don't turn too ugly. This is ceratinly a performance better than expected given the modest price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An active external amplifier lets the Galaxy Gio show its full potential and achieve great scores all over. The smartphone is also pleasingly loud, so there's nothing to frown at, really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the degradation when headphones come into play is major. Volume levels take a hit, but it's stereo crosstalk that suffers the worst. Intermodulation distortion is affected too, though not quite so significantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A very decent 3MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio has a 3.2 autofocus megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. There is no flash of any kind though, but there are some extra goodies at hand such as face and smile detection and geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is standard Samsung for the most part ? and that?s not a bad thing. It?s easily thumbable and offers readily accessible scene and shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio hasn?t got a proper shutter key so you?ll have to use the virtual on-screen alternative. To activate face detection, you should switch to Smile shot mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is quite good for a 3.2 megapixel snapper. The contrast is nice as is the color rendering. There is fine amount of captured detail and the noise levels are kept reasonable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the 3.2MP lineup. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QVGA video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio can record QVGA videos at 15fps. This falls into the barely usable category ? OK for MMS, but not much else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the QVGA video sample from the Samsung Galaxy Gio.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio is ready for worldwide roaming with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The connectivity pacakge offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), Buetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 Froyo enables Bluetooth file transfers, so there?s little else to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio doesn?t pack much internal memory (181MB is downright low for app installation), but it comes with a microSD slot with supports for cards up to 32GB. Thanks to Android Froyo you can install compatible apps on the SD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Galaxy Gio hassle-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is arguably the best available on a mobile device. It?s fast, generally bug-free and easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio browser supports three zoom methods ? dedicated buttons, double tap and multi-touch pinch-zooming. The browser also supports text reflow ? a moment after setting the zoom level, columns of text align to the screen width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is big enough to handle complex pages well, though the text isn?t as sharp at low zoom levels as it is on phones with higher resolution. Regardless, it?s still readable and panning and zooming are fast so the Galaxy Gio scores a good mark in web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the Galaxy Gio is running the Flash-capable Android Froyo, there is no Flash support in the web browser. The situation is quite similar to the LG Optimus One and Samsung Galaxy Ace: the processor is either incapable of handling Flash content (or it?s disabled due to performance issues).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio has the YouTube app to partially compensate for the lack of Flash support. Of course, there are plenty of other video sharing sites and sites that use Flash for completely different purposes, but you have to live without them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio comes with the ThinkFree Office pack pre-installed ? it?s a document viewer and an editor combined. It works like a charm and is capable of pinch zooming. Both panning and zooming are fast and the overall performance of the office package is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized ? the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app is decent and allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. But you don?t have the Stopwatch, the Timer and World Clock options. Still you get a Voice Recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Samsung has included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A few applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung filled the Galaxy Gio with a few of their home-brewed applications and we really appreciate their work. Most of them are quite useful and can be updated via Samsung Apps ? the secondary app repository on your phone. Whenever Samsung updates any of the current apps or widgets, or releases new ones, you?ll find them here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from different devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social Hub combines messaging and media sharing ? this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services ? SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Your Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio is running the latest version of Android and the standard HVGA screen means the phone can make full use of the Android Market (some apps won?t run on low-res screens).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google maps and GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Gio comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about two minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is on board, complete with Navigation, which can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is still limited though, and it relies on Internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio doesn?t come with a third-party SatNav solution preinstalled but you can easily snatch one off the Android market. There are both paid and free options on offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio is part of the new Samsung midrange along with the Ace, the Mini and the Fit. All these gadgets have a similar objective ? offer the all round Android experience within budget. The Ace and the Gio are obviously cast in the same mold. No doubt the weaknesses are shared too. With dismal video recording and lack of DivX support, the Gio isn?t a media-centric device. But if you know it up front, this is an easy phone to enjoy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Gio is nothing out of the ordinary but will certainly play a part as Samsung need to have enough depth to successfully compete against both droid and Symbian midrangers. The Galaxy Ace tops the list with a bigger screen and Gingerbread. But if you don?t need the latest software and won?t fuss over screen size and camera, the Galaxy Gio may be just the thing you are looking for. We shouldn?t forget its cheaper siblings either ? the Galaxy Mini and the Galaxy Fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Ace ? Samsung Galaxy Mini ? Samsung Galaxy Fit</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we?re to look elsewhere, LG are already having a successful franchise with the Optimus One. It costs the same as the Gio, has similar screen and camera, but is powered by a 600MHz processor. The Gingerbread update should be around the corner though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The year old HTC Wildfire is running Android Froyo with the in-house Sense UI on top. It?s got a slower processor and lower-res screen, but looks more stylish than the Samsung Galaxy Gio.</paragraph>
