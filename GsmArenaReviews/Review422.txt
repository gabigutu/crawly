			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson launched Z530, their latest clamshell with music features just as we expect the W300 model to hit the market. At first glance, the two phones look very similar since they have exactly the same dimensions, but the W300 has more features and a better display. The Sony Ericsson Z530 seems to be the first officially released phone working with the new Memory Stick Micro (M2) card type. The advantage of Z530 is the expected lower price.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Z530 model comes to fill a somewhat wide market hole for mid-low devices. The looks of the phone will mainly attract women but the strange construction of the opened phone will definitely put off some of them. The phone is intended to replace the Z520 model and compared to it, the new handset offers a bunch of new features. The main display uses the new UBC technology and works in 65K colors. Also, the new Z530 has a memory card slot and more internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson Z530</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first impressions of the Sony Ericsson Z530 were that the phone feels surprisingly solid for its plastic look. The covers are well elaborated and there are no crevices between them. During the testing period, the phone did not produce a single creek sound nor was there any sign of loosening of the construction. A well deserved compliment should go to the manufacturer for that. The matt rubber plastic on the front and back cover is also very nice. It feels good to touch, gives a grip and doesn't catch any fingerprints. The bad thing about it is that it tends to develop sweat spots from the user's skin moisture. This may confuse a little because the surface of the phone will look bumpy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice and small<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Z530 is a relatively small phone for its class. With its 90 x 47 x 24 mm and 93 g it leaves a good impression of a small device. When held in hand, it looks normal and when opened, the size of the phone enables maximum functionality because of the balanced proportions. The opening mechanism works fine and shouldn't give you any troubles. The phone can be opened using only one hand. There is an option in the menu to accompany the opening process with a polyphonic sound. This will be the only sound that can be heard when opening the clamshell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Z530 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are not many things on the outside of the phone. A Z530i sign is located on a metal plate on the front cover, surrounded by the matt rubber plastic mentioned above. The second display of the device is located just above it. The plate and the display are the only parts that catch fingerprints easily. On top of the front cover are the camera lens and a self-portrait mirror. In Z530 the camera lens has no protection by a mechanical cover. The front panel features exchangeable covers, which is something we have got used to see in the Z-series. The phone is offered in three color combinations: Soft Black, Chromic Grey, and Elegant Red but their availability is market dependant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Z530 from all sides</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover really lacks any noticeable elements. In the upper part are the loud-speaker grid and the manufacturer logo (the green-silver "ball"). Below we see an engraved Sony Ericsson sign. Basically there is no button or jut for opening the battery cover. You need to use your fingernail in order to lose the cover. When you have managed that, you will see the Lithium-Ion battery of 900 mAh, the SIM card bed beneath it and the M2 card slot on the right side. Regrettably we didn't have a M2 card during the testing and couldn't test it. This type of memory cards is still very new and is not available on the market. It was announced in September 2005 by Sony as an alternative to its "big brothers" - the Memory Stick Pro and Duo. It is targeted at the mobile phones market for its small size 15x12.5mm. But still it is compatible with the Memory Stick Pro cards and it can be loaded into an adapter card and inserted into a Memory Stick Pro slot on a notebook computer or a PC card reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Under the battery cover ? the M2 card slot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone has two significant elements. Firstly, at the top is the dual volume button. When pressed while the device is closed the outer display shows information about the battery status. And secondly, in the bottom part of the left side is the M2 sign which indicates where the memory card slot is (under the back cover, however). The right side of the phone only features the Infrared receiver. On the top of the phone is the popular Sony Ericsson "hanger" which hides the antenna. On the bottom is the cable port.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Comfortable? Almost<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad design of Z530 is very interesting. The numeric keys are made of spheres that are overlapping with each other. This composition is suitable for SMS writing and the buttons are easy to distinguish. But the other parts of the keypad have some flaws. The soft keys in the upper part are too small and the clamshell construction makes hard the access to them. They are located above the Back button and the "C" clear button. The four-way control button and the main center button can also be easily mistaken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The keypad of Z530</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the bottom part of the keypad are the Activity Menu button and the Switch Off button. They are both so tiny that are hardly usable. As for the switch off button, it's not as important as it's not supposed to be used very often. When pressed once, it brings up the Profiles menu and when long pressed, it switches off the phone. The Activity Menu button though, is very useful, for it brings up a tabbed menu with Shortcuts, recent events, etc., but due to its tiny size I guess it will not be very popular among the users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of the keypad is not the best one. It glooms in an orange nuance and tries to cover the whole keypad but is rather poor. However, the buttons are well elaborated and thus can be easily distinguished even in the dark. Only the soft keys and the bottom keys are really hard to use but that has nothing to do with the backlighting.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight is no longer a problem<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The external display is surprisingly nice. Strangely, it is only monochromatic while in Z520 the outer display was a CSTN 4K colors one. Nevertheless due to its orange-black combination the Z530 secondary display is very good looking and legible, even under heavy sunlight. When active, the sub-display shows information about the network coverage, the battery status, and icons of switched on features, time, date and the network carrier name. When the side volume buttons are pressed, the display shows battery information. Of course, Caller ID is also available, as is information about missed calls. The inactive mode of the sub-display can be set to display a digital clock but it's not very legible. If you're playing a song, the display will show the music player information about the length of the track and the current time progress. Also, it will display the artist and song names.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Loud and clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Z530 has an excellent network coverage and we experienced no difficulties with it during the test period. The loudness of the conversations is not very high but still on a normal level. The speaker is not powerful enough thus not able to produce crystal clear sound. The loud speaker, however, is a different story. It performs very well and produces clear sound without any unwanted noises.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The same old interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the phone is not innovative and the outlook of it is the same as in past models - just a standard Sony Ericsson non-smartphone interface. The main menu is a grid matrix with 4 rows and 3 columns with icons. When you move on a different icon it zooms in. The submenus are either in a list view with small icons on the left side or are in a tab-organized view. The Activity Menu button brings up a tabbed menu with 3 tabs: (1) New events (which shows recent calls, received messages, etc.), (2) Shortcuts list of applications and (3) Bookmarks menu.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>   Actvity Menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has 24MB of shared internal memory. The M2 card slot allows memory extension but for now it's hard to find such cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 4 available preinstalled themes on Z530. Changing themes changes only the colors of the interface and the wallpaper. The default theme is light-blue with non-animated wallpaper. The Bling theme is violet and features animated wallpaper. There are also the Floomasia theme (red with flower wallpaper) and the Goldfish theme (yellow-gold with interesting animated wallpaper). On our screenshots you can only see the Default light-blue theme.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fast &amp; functional phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Sony Ericsson Z530 is very good and easy to use. The maximum capacity is 1000 contacts. The added contacts can be ordered either by first or by last name. They can also be organized in groups. A tabbed menu appears when adding a new contact. The first tab is for the name and number fields. The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for picture and ringtone assignment, the fourth is for personal information like: title, company, street, city, state, zip code, country. There are separate fields for two different addresses. The last, fifth, tab is for additional information and the contacts birthday date. When you add a birthday, the phone asks if you want to transfer it to the calendar which is useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Phonebook list ? adding contact information in different tabs ? contact with assigned picture is calling</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface shows up to 5 contacts at a time. Different phone numbers email and web addresses can be switched when pushing on either the left or right way of the four-way button. Searching through the phonebook is possible via letter-by-letter typing of the first letters of the contact's name. PC synchronization is seamless when using the Sony Ericsson PC Suite.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call records are simple<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls menu can be accessed by pushing the left soft key. It consists of a tabbed menu with 4 tabs. The first one shows all recent calls and has a maximum capacity of 30 entries. The second tab is for the Answered (received) calls, the third is for the dialed calls and the last one is for the missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Browsing through call records</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SMS maniacs will not be disappointed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Z530 supports Text, Picture and Voice messages. It also supports emails. The SMS editor is simple and easy to use. It shows character count when there are less than 10 characters left of the 160 limit. When you pass the limit, it shows a "SMS 2" warning sign, which means that the message will be divided into two parts. Writing can be assisted by a T9 dictionary. The editor allows adding pictures, sounds, melodies, animations and thus can create MMS messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Reading SMS ? writing SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you read a message, it's shown in 5 lines. On top of the display is shown the number of the sender and the time and date of receiving. The phone features a My Friends function which is something like Instant Messaging feature, but that's network dependant. All received messages (no matter what kind) are stored in the Inbox. Only emails have different saving location. The email client is typical for the recent Sony Ericsson phones. It handles attachments, you can send a picture from the camera as an attachment. The email client can be set to download only the headers of the messages to keep your data charges low. Several email accounts can be set up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music in background<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Z530 offers very good music features. The phone plays both music and video files pretty well. Files are organized by artist or tracks. Playlists are supported as well. During playback of a music file, the player shows the track name and time progress. Video files cannot be played in full screen mode. Only time progress is shown when playing videos. The Media Player allows running in background when playing a song. It also can play when the phone is closed. Generally, the Media Player application of the phone is intuitive and easy to use. Our device didn't come in its official box so we cannot say for sure if there will be earphones in the package. What we did, though, is to test the phone with K750 earpieces. We played one and the same track on both the SE Z530 and the SE K750. Comparing the sound quality we must say that Z530 does produce a good quality sound but it's somewhat inferior to that of K750. Regrettably, there is no FM radio.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The weakest link<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with a mere VGA camera. There is an Extended Mode in the camera menu, that raises the resolution up to 1.3 megapixel but that resolution is interpolated which means that the software merely stretches the real 640x480 image in order to reach those dimensions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Extended (1.3 MP) vs VGA mode - the extended mode doesn't deliver more detail</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is made very plain. It displays the current count of pictures that can be taken until the memory is full. The menu lets you choose the size of the picture, the applied effect (if any), and to choose if you want to active the shutter sound. Night mode and self-portrait timer are available also. There is a Shoot Mode submenu with 4 options in it: Normal, Panorama, Frames and Burst. The camera menu is made of two tabs, the first is for taking pictures and the second one is for recording videos.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Instant PC synchronization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Z530 has GPRS Class 10 support for fast data transfers. It also has Bluetooth, Infrared and USB 2.0 connectivity. We tried connecting the phone to a PC via Bluetooth and it was seamless. Phonebook synchronization, data transfer, etc. is very fast and easy. Besides Bluetooth, there is another possibility for connecting your device to PC. The phone allows using the custom USB data cable DCU-60. We haven't tried this variant but most probably it won't have any issues.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone has a very good web browser. NetFront supports both WAP and HTML modes. Regrettably, the low display resolution does not allow exploring the full abilities of the browser. There is a Smart-fit feature of the application for resizing web pages to the visible area of the display. We tried browsing very complex web pages and they are shown pretty well but require a lot of scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Using NetFront web browser</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A handy organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer menu of the phone consists of several applications: Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Calculator, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Applications, Code memo, Alarms. The calendar is semi-synchronized with the phonebook as it asks you if you wish to transfer the birthday date of the contact to the calendar. The Tasks, Notes and Calculator features are very simple and plain. The Synchronization option is for synchronizing through the Internet with a server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Organizer menu ? Calendar ? Calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Applications folder you will find a News Reader which is an application for reading RSS feeds. This is a very useful feature of the phone. The Alarms application has common options but is located in two different places. It's in the Organizer menu as well as in the main menu as a separate icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   RSS news reader ? Alarms</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the RSS News reader, the phone has some other preinstalled applications. There is the Media player, the Games, Face Warp (program for making effects on taken pictures), Video DJ (for making video clips, interesting application), Photo DJ (also for applying effect on pictures), Music DJ (composer, very simple and not professional at all) and Remote Control (for controlling PC via Bluetooth).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Entertainment menu </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time-eaters<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Z530 has four preinstalled games in our firmware version. They are all trial versions only. The games are (1) Neopets, a virtual pet world environment; (2) Neopets-Mobile; (3) Puzzle Slider, a puzzle with a sliced image in pieces which you are to reconstruct back to the original; (4) and, finally, the Quadra Pop, a Tetris like game, which is probably the most amusing game in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Games menu ? Quadra Pop </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An easy-going nifty gadget<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In conclusion, we must say that the phone definitely has its virtues and will most probably find its own share of dedicated fans. Except for the poor display and camera, the other features of the phone are of good caliber. With its reasonable price Sony Ericsson Z530 will be a popular choice for those who want an entry-level music phone boasting some extra features.</paragraph>
