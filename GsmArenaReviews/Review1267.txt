			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One big scary smartphone, the HTC Titan. Visible from space. Oh well, a little exaggeration won't hurt. But as far as we can tell, they certainly wanted it big enough to see from Finland.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft have a thing going on up north that they want to explore. But old-time partners HTC won't take the cold shoulder. They are honoring their part of the agreement and making a big statement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size of the Titan aside, the message HTC are sending is loud and clear. Nokia will be instrumental in shaping the future, essential to fulfilling the vision of a third ecosystem. But here we are, delivering here and now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Titan is among the first WP7 Mango phones to make it to the market. It?s the biggest too ? and likely to stay this way for quite a while. And although it feels good to think HTC were keen to show to newly-fledged allies Nokia what?s what, the size of the phone is more than just muscle flexing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many upgraders will be looking at the Titan and the bigger screen is the right thing to show them. Otherwise the doubters would?ve been right to ask: why Titan and not a Mango-running HD7. But the display is not the only upgrade over last year?s Windows Phone flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already let a spoiler slip in our recent shootout. The Titan is an impressive cameraphone. It falls short in the video recording department but the lack of Full HD video is a platform limitation. Dual-core support is yet to come to Windows Phone 7. The HTC Titan is no slowpoke though on its 1.5 GHZ processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s got the typically solid HTC build too. The phone sure looks a handful but not as scary as some may think. The Metro UI plays its part here too. The Windows Phone 7 interface is good-looking and offers a novel software experience. The first generation didn?t quite get everything right but the Mango update is a big step forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango has enabled multitasking and improved the overall experience, while HTC are lending some of their custom add-ons to a package with already solid Office and Organizer credentials and deep social network integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan is a quick ticking smartphone ? responsive and well connected. It?s a capable cameraphone too, well above the usual HTC standards. Plus, the OS is out of its teens and ready to be taken seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Titan should be the phone to solidify HTC?s reputation as a Windows Phone partner and help Microsoft make a transition from strictly-business to media-centric and social.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The massive HTC Titan leaves almost no room for accessories in the box. You can rest assured though that the essentials are covered. A set of earphones, a USB cable and a detachable charger head are in the bundle. The usual leaflets are there too and that's it. Being a Windows Phone device it doesn't come with expandable storage, so no memory card in the package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to sheer size the Titan lives up to its name. At131.5 x 70.7 x 9.9 mm it's an impressive slab, bordering on scary. We should note though that it's not much bigger than the 4.3" HTC HD7. At 160g, it?s actually two grams lighter than the predecessor (162 g). The sub-centimeter slimness and good use of space around the display make it reasonably comfortable to handle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 4.7" S-LCD screen is the reason we're careful with the adjectives describing the HTC Titan. It's not as frighteningly big as you might have imagined. We can't really see it as the ladies' favorite but we have to acknowledge the market's been steadily moving towards bigger screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Titan feels nice to the touch. The styling is sober, consciously stripped of embellishments. The phone has the typically solid HTC build. It?s nearly all-screen up front and almost no bezel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to phones like the Galaxy S II, there's nothing out of the ordinary about the Titan. Placed side by side with an HTC Radar, it really looks a lot bigger but then again the difference in screen estate says it all: the Radar has a 3.7" display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-LCD capacitive unit of the HTC Titan has WVGA resolution and not qHD, which has been something of a favorite for HTC lately. We're guessing it's because WP7 isn't very flexible with different resolutions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put things into perspective, the HTC Sensation XE's 4.3" touchscreen has a pixel density of 256ppi, while the Titan manages only 199ppi. And while we were largely unimpressed with the Sensation XE, the Titan is quite a disappointment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, the screen size is quite a stretch for the resolution. This is most embarrassingly visible in the web browser, where text is as good as impossible to read at max zoom-out. On the 5" HD screen of the Samsung Galaxy Note this not a problem at all. Text is even smaller but absolutely legible on the sharp screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the preceding HTC HD7, one fault the engineers did well to address was the low response time of the screen, which caused an unpleasant ghosting effect when scrolling listed menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the HTC Titan's screen there's a secondary 1.3 MP video-call camera, a proximity sensor and an ambient light sensor. Three haptic-enabled capacitive touch controls are placed below the 4.7"display. The Back, Home and Search keys are well-spaced and nicely backlit in white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the HTC Titan is where the volume rocker and camera button are. The shutterkey is rather thin but with very distinct half press. Pressing and holding the key will unlock the phone and launch the camera right out of the pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing on the right is the MicroUSB port. It's too close to the bottom and the cable will be getting in the way if you need to use the device while charging or during a PC connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the HTC Titan features the 3.5 mm audio jack, a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation and the power/lock button. Perhaps it would have been better if HTC had borrowed one from Samsung's book and placed the button on the sideof the phone. It's just that, given the handset's size, most people will have trouble comfortably pressing the lock key in single-hand use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the Titan there's the primary microphone and the battery cover latch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Titan features the 8 MP camera lens and dual LED flash combo. There's also a loudspeaker grill and a Windows Phone logo at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the battery cover latch causes the screen and phone innards to pop out. Effectively, the battery cover wraps the phone's body in. This solution helps avoid wobbles and squeaks but doesn't quite qualify as a unibody. We have a full-sized battery cover and a phone that divides into two equally sized parts. For a real unibody, you need to check out the HTC Radar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, what's more important is that inside you'll find a 1600 Li-Ion battery and the SIM card compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery life is a mixed bag and it can't be just the screen taking its toll. The HTC Sensation XE - for a fairly recent reference - does way better even though its 1730mAh battery needs to power a screen that's richer in pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We got about a day's worth out of the Titan before it needed a refill. We did quite a lot of browsing over Wi-Fi, a couple of hours of exploring the different apps, listening to music and watching videos. We did take a lot of pictures too - the Titan took part in our 8 MP shootout. You could probably squeeze about a day and a half out of the Titan but you?d need to turn down the screen brightness and probably stop some apps from running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Titan boasts the biggest screen HTC have put on a phone yet - and it's one of the thinnest WP 7 handsets too. By no means small, the HTC Titan uses space well and allows reasonably comfortable handling. We like the phone's solid feel and quality build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most tasks are better performed on a screen this size: from typing, to web browsing to watching videos. However, thedisplay could've certainly used a higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's time to move on to the Windows Phone Mango inside the Titan.The updated software is a strong pint in favor of the second generation WP 7 phones. HTC may not have the liberty of modifying the user interface as heavily as they do in Android, but they've snuck in some of their Sense UI niceties nonetheless.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone gets a taste of Mango<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan's user interface is the same Windows Phone one you'll get on any competing device running the OS. The only differentiating thing is the HTC green preloaded as a theme color. The interface is very clean and simple - it's comprised of live tiles that show information like the current date, calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more, all without the need to open up any of the applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pushing the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. The background of the lock screen can be changed from either the settings menu or from the picture gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device and reveals the live-tile Metro user interface. It's a very fluid vertical grid of Live tiles that shows one or two tiles organized in bricked style. Each of these can be reorganized by which ever order you like and you can place almost anything in the grid by holding your finger over it and selecting the Pin to start option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Live tiles, the basic building blocks of the Start screen of Windows Phone have been revamped. Now they are quicker and offer more info. For example, the Pictures tile shows an animated slideshow of your images. The Group tile (Groups is a new feature to boot) lists friend updates. The application list has grown a virtual Search button, which makes finding apps easier for those with many apps installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get things going, here's a video demonstrating the Titan in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the main novelties brought by the latest WP build - 7.5 Mango - is multitasking. It still isn't true multitasking; things are being done the iOS way. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We only worry that this logic can be too restrictive for some apps, but we'll see how things pan out. Of course, there will be a transitional period when some apps will support multitasking and others won't. We've been there with the iOS, when it first left the realm of single-tasking ? it?s not that bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, to switch between apps you press and hold the Back key (that's right, the Back key, not the Windows key). The app switcher itself looks similar to that of Symbian or WebOS: thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to exactly how you left it. Usually, the last 5-6 apps are here. You can't "kill" any of those apps, this is more of a history of the recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, as you open more apps, the old ones start to drop out of the list. Once an app is gone, you have to launch it again the old fashioned way, which has the drawback of starting it over from the beginning. Finally apps with active background tasks (e.g. streaming online radio) will keep on working.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking can be disabled from the settings to save battery. There you'll also find a list of all installed apps that support multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu reveals two sets of options - system and applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Applications settings enables you to configure individual settings for each app you have installed on the device - the People hub, Phone, Maps and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7.5 can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate a text, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too (*cough*Android*cough*) but voice commands are a big part of iOS (and a loudly touted one at that), so WP7.5 can brag about it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People hub from Windows Phone 7 was impressive, but the 7.5 update makes it absolutely brilliant. Part of that is due to the better social network support, complete with Twitter and LinkedIn.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty much the same. You still get the clever way of jumping to contacts starting with a specific letter, the What's new tab that aggregates status updates from all contacts and the Recent tab, which lists only recently viewed contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And deeper social networking support makes things even better. When viewing a contact's profile, you get everything from call, text, send email, write on wall, mention on Twitter and so on. The contact photo, along with the latest status update, are visible on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The What's new tab works like its namesake in the People hub, but only shows updates from the specific contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting addition is the new History tab. The complete history of exchange with a contact is in one place listed by day. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features of the hub is Groups, a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations (there's more location goodness coming on later). You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub as a phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People hub is present in the Phone app too. It takes the form of a contacts tab but only instead of contacts, you have people with profiles ? a term taken right out of social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends ? everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and they can be displayed as ?First Last? or ?Last, First? (the two settings are separate), you can also include or exclude Facebook friends, import only Facebook contacts that have a phone number and add several accounts to sync with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side shows only new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recently called contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact?s profile shows the contact photo. Below that there are actions ? ?call mobile?, ?text mobile?, ?write on wall?, ?view website? and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the ?What?s new? panel?, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Call reception on the HTC Titan was good and it held on to signal even in closed quarters where by default the signal bars drop a few. In-call sound quality is brilliant and loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets ? a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the HTC Titan did good in recognizing our commands, though it did have issues separating the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name "Mandark".</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist ? it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What?s missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone ? a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an incoming call, the contact?s photo will appear full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note ? status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did our traditional loudspeaker test on the HTC Titan and it got a Very Good mark. Turning the device on its back increases the ringing even more. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging was heavily retooled for version 7.5. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech balloons and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are placed only when the conversation moves to a different platform so it's not cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which platform to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't attach anything to Facebook messages, you'll need to use MMS for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the new OS (that is dependant on the carrier and your plan). It works as you would expect, by letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email where Mango contributed too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the highly requested feature was a unified inbox for email - and Windows Phone 7.5 delivers. You can now link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation view was expected - it lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It?s the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. We expected to be able to swipe between the messages, but that wasn?t the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone constitutes of the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes - that's it. The layout remains the same on all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard comes in many sizes, depending on the device. On the HTC Titan it's very comfortable and given that currently the smallest WP7 screen found on a phone is 3.5" there can't be any size complaints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection and copy-paste functionality were desired functions even before the 7.5 Mango update. They became a reality with the pre-Mango No-Do update. Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-res Picture tile is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub has been polished up a bit in Windows Phone Mango. There's a new People tab, which lets you browse photo albums by individual contacts or groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. New functionality allows apps to integrate into the Pictures hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Pictures hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed and finally applications, where on the HTC Titan you'll find the Photo Enhancer app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums features the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't assign individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends or closed ones so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Pictures hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll unifies your entire collection of photos and videos, taken with the device, in a grid of 4x5. You cannot change the view of the camera roll. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or pinch to zoom. We appreciate that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 used to be quite restricted when it came to sharing - it's still not perfect (it still downsizes photos before emailing them, for one) but you can now share videos too, either via email or on Facebook. Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook or the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo. It's a nice feature but one that produces unrealistic results at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Pictures hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a time scroll and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn?t recognize .AVI files ? in other words, don?t expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 ? so, you can watch those formats on the HTC Titan, it?s just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer's capabilities).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen ? like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music + Videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when synching with Zune. The third section is podcasts where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get radio and marketplace links in the Music &amp; Videos tile. It doesn't offer the option to listen to online radio stations so you would need to insert the headgear to get reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the current frequency in very large digits ? swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction. You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music has a simple and straightforward interface. You won?t have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger ? you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings along a slight change in design to the now playing screen. The favorite, repeat and shuffle buttons are now placed horizontally next to the album cover instead of hidden behind it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the HTC Titan didn't manage to impress us with its audio output. The smartphone wasn't terrible in the "active external amplifier" case, but it wasn't perfect either and its performance with headphones on was downright mediocre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the headphones out of the equation, the Titan had near perfect frequency response, great noise levels and dynamic range and little total harmonic distortion. The intermodulation distortion was higher than average though and so was the stereo crosstalk. Volume levels were among the highest we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results in the second test were far less impressive. Volume remained higher than average, but noise levels and dynamic range readings took a hit, while intermodulation distortion and stereo crosstalk spiked. It all adds up to a performance that you won't be writing home about.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bright 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan is equipped with a 8 MP autofocus camera with a few tricks under its belt - it utilizes a 28mm wide-angle F2.2 lens and a BSI (back-side illuminated) sensor. The end result is stills of 3264x2448 pixels resolution. It also features a 1.3 MP front-facing camera for self-portraits and video calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the fancy camera specs actually mean in real life is that due to the wide-angle lens you'll be able to fit more into the picture than with regular 35 mm lens phones. The F2.2 aperture number means that the phone's camera can capture images with more light, which coupled with the BSI sensor produces very well-light images even in darker environments. More on that to follow in the image quality section later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple ? you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, second video-call camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers very extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness, ISO and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly the camera key will wake the phone with a single press ? that is unlock it and start the camera. Unfortunately it doesn't utilize the proximity sensor like before and now the camera app can be accidentally opened in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise reduction is too aggressive, giving photos that dreaded watercolor painting look. Fine detail is smeared over but even then, there's still some color noise visible. The Titan finds a better balance between the clipping of the highlights and shadows than most but it suffers from the same yellowish oversaturated colors as the XE. There was a noticeable pink spot to most of the samples too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos in the dark with the Titan were noisy with decent detail. The flash was strong but but there's a tint affecting the whole photo. Other than that low-light shots are pretty usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan has a wider angle lens that its competitors, which gives it an edge in landscape shots, at the price of lower fine detail and more lens distortion when you get up close.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HTC Titan enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 8MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your captured videos appear in a thumbnail slideshow just as they do in the Pictures hub and Music &amp; videos hub. You get a flash on/off toggle in the settings menu too - the phone uses the LED as a video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan videos have very good detail for the 720p mark, but again heavy compression kicks in to smudge things out in some areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Results in the dark are quite alright - noise is kept in check and the amount of captured detail is surprisingly close to that in well-lit videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Titan's videos have stereo sound too (AAC codec is used again).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 720 video sample of the HTC Titan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes an untouched 720p@30fps version of the sample for direct download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the HTC Titan in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with competing mobile camcorders - the Meego-strutting N9 and the Arc S with the Exmor R sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This test shows curious results - the camera seems to have potential but the low-bitrate (around 10Mbps) smears out all the fine detail, producing unsatisfactory results. These are same results as the Sensation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer mobile does without Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone was updated to the latest version for the 7.5 update and it improves the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar is always visible (but the status bar at the top of the screen is auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button. You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar, which is a handy shortcut for looking things up if you're not sure which site exactly will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is quite minimalist - you have only the URL bar at the bottom with a reload icon to the left. Swiping the bar upward reveals shortcuts for tabs, recent, favorites, add to favorites, share page, pin to start and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history but it does offer a very neat option to choose a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The six tab ceiling hasn?t been lifted - it's not too bad, but competing OSes don't have such limitations. We were also hoping to see text reflow, but no luck on that either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What has changed is performance - the new browser relies on hardware graphics acceleration to provide smoother graphics (and video) and animation and the JavaScript engine has been retooled as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft are so confident that they've set up a page specifically for testing the performance of your phone - both JavaScript and graphics. You can find the page here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't be afraid to pit the phone against even a desktop browser - the tests are pretty demanding and if you're not running a recent version of the major desktop browsers, your computer will surely break a sweat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing search on Windows Phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you search on Bing, one of the things that might be offered as a relevant result is an app from the Marketplace. For example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also grew two new search modes - song recognition and barcode scanner. Those are features popular with apps, but with WP7.5 you get those natively as part of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera scanner can also snap a photo of text, perform OCR and translate it into another language.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Marketplace just now catching up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Marketplace is playing catch up with the Apple Appstore and the Android Market. Currently it has north of 38 thousand apps available. It?s organized into four main sections ? applications, games, music and the HTC apps store. A fifth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update ? there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it?s on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too ? new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (it?s 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC apps features free HTC-created applications for Windows Phone, like the HTC Hub, Photo enhancer, Notes, the well-known Flashlight app (as seen on Android too) and more. There's a total of 10 apps there but the list should grow in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the try option, which is available to many games and apps. It gives you a trial of a game before you decide to buy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as a what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections ? games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox ? from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests ? which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there?s a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live ? the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace. We did test games like Need for Speed, Kinectimals, Angry birds and had no problems with the HTC Titan, the 1GHz processor and Adreno 205 GPU were more than adequate in handling more complex graphics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps lights your path<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bing Maps is the heart of the Windows Phone "getting around" scene, until Nokia's WP devices come along with full-fledged voice guided navigation for free via Nokia Drive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps is a core part of the Windows Phone experience and there's a new feature that makes version 7.5 a must-have - driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not quite voice-guided navigation. Here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that make reading easy. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though, it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all the new Maps can do for you though. The app will locate nearby points of interest with the new feature called Local Scout and it will even show you indoor maps of malls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from a "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really cool functionality of Local scout is you can pin places to your homescreen. So let's say you like a pub and like to check it out from time to time, read reviews, call for a reservation - it's right there on your homescreen - that's neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like Bing maps and are especially fond of the Nokia maps integration coming soon - it will heat things up for Google maps. As for Nokia Drive, the full-fledged voice-guided navigation on Windows Phone, we're also eager to check that out. It could land on all WP devices some day.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured Office<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Mango SkyDrive integration is one thing that was improved. Now, docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive. In case you missed it, Microsoft are offering free 25GB of storage with each SkyDrive account (but individual files are limited to 100MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more - the Locations tab replaces the old SharePoint tab. This lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through SharePoint or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections ? Documents, Locations and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let?s look at the two most important apps ? Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported. PowerPoint files live in the Documents section too ? but they are for viewing only, you can?t edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub got better too - it grew the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you?d need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft?s collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you?re done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft?s fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors. Still the innovation that Mango has brought to Windows Phone Office is great and shows Microsoft is dedicated to improving the Office experience further.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizing skills on Windows Phone are dully covered and is a place where HTC do much to improve the experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the usual calendar, alarm, calculator, to-do apps. HTC brings along a very good-looking Notes app, Lists, Calculator, Converter and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app is very straightforward. You have virtual backboard where notes get pinned (you can rearrange them however you want) and turning it over brings up a whiteboard that keeps your notes organized by date of creation. Scribbling a new note is easy - just tap on the sticky notes in the left corner and the QWERTY is brought up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The business side of Windows Phone has its own list of cool updates in version 7.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is simple to use and has an iOS-esque interface. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone Mango provides users with the basics in smartphone organizing but should you need anything more the Marketplace is there too - it offers apps for just about everything - most of which are free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WindowsPhone.com remotely protects your data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone website is the cloud of sorts for all WP7 smartphones. All you need to do to use the site is register your email (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) and then setup an account on your Windows Phone device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options given to you on the windowsphone.com website are limited to billing information and security. You can update your billing information, view the apps you've bought and go to the web version of the WP Marketplace and buy new apps. Note that they will be sent to your phone to be downloaded locally on the device, unlike on the Zune app for your PC or Mac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The features most important to users are the Find, Ring, Lock or Erase. To use them you'll have to input a phone number out of a total of 37 countries. After you've done this the website will have access to your phone's location so you'll be able to pinpoint its almost exact location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features are pretty self-explanatory - Ring will use your phone's ringtone to send a single if you've lost it around the house, Lock will lock it with a 4-digit PIN code and Erase will wipe all your sensitive data off the device so you don't have to worry about it falling into undesirable hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn't like about the windowsphone.com cloud is that it doesn't allow wireless sync like on the iCloud, for example. We just think that any cloud-based service should offer this. Also the number of countries that allow tracking your device is limited and many countries where WP is available won't have access to these much-needed features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the website includes guides on each individual feature of your phone and depending on where you live there's a very detailed list of providers and operators that offer WP handsets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC don?t need to prove anything to anyone when it comes to Windows smartphones. They?ve just come a full circle from the TyTN II to the Titan. There have been enough opportunities for them to demonstrate their commitment. From PocketPC to Mango, Microsoft?s mobile OS has been forced to evolve to serve a new market. Smartphones used to only be relevant to corporate users ? they?re now a lifestyle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In about five years, Windows-powered phones went from PocketPC boom to nearly bust. Android and iOS changed the users? attitudes and expectations. It must?ve been tempting at some point for HTC to go all in with Google. Who would?ve blamed them?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe HTC didn?t want all their eggs in the same basket. Or they had to honor a partnership that made them their name. Either way, they?re still on board and obviously taking their partnership with Microsoft seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They?ve made their statement. And it couldn?t have been bigger that the HTC Titan. The phone?s size is not all politics by the way. HTC must?ve felt they needed something in the same category as the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and the Galaxy Note. They wanted their Windows Phone flagship protected against future unpleasant surprises. The Titan certainly keeps the Nokia Lumia 800 at a safe distance. But it?s already waiting for the possibility of a Nokia 900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan has good value to upgraders ? and HTC have potentially enough of those. Had it had the same screen size as the HD7, people would?ve simply upgraded the software rather than buy a new phone. It?s good to see a solid cameraphone by HTC too. Not underpowered either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, quad-core processing isn?t far away while WP7 is still stuck on single core. The 1.5GHz HTC Titan is by no means a laggard but the platform has limitations it needs to sort out and do it quickly. The non-expandable memory and lack of mass storage mode are points against ? and so is the screen resolution and the video recording resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s the sort of things that cast doubt on otherwise great smartphones like the Titan. WP7 handsets by HTC are not as good as Android phones by HTC ? at least for the time being. The Sensation XL is the Android version of the Titan, an almost exact match. But the Android flagship is out of reach. The Sensation XE is a dual-core beast with a qHD screen (albeit smaller) and Full HD video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sensation XL ? HTC Sensation XE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems fair. WP 7 has still got to catch up with Android and iOS. The Marketplace is a crucial part of th&#x435; equation. Bringing Nokia on board will hopefully motivate more developers and speed up the growth of the app market. It?s becoming complicated though. As three major platforms are battling it out, things are no longer black and white. Partners become competitors, enemies are suddenly allies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What?s the HTC Titan going to do about it? Well, it sends a message to both friends and foes. Phones are never too big to fail but the HTC Titan is big enough to be taken seriously.</paragraph>
