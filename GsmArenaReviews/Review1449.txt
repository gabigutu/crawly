			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last week we walked with dinosaurs. We followed phones in their search of the perfect size and shape. We?ll now take another step away from our usual routine and look back at the gadgets that lost or are about to lose in the survival of the fittest. Mobile phones are no longer a commodity ? but a necessity. And they?ve made other, less fortunate species, expendable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, the times when it was enough for a mobile phone to make calls are long gone. We demand and expect the best service for our money. So, today?s handsets will do so many things that only a couple of years ago required using several different devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Remember the times when you had to carry a pager, a street payphone card and a personal organizer at all times to keep in touch? Now the cheapest of phones will do the job and is actually better at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today we look at all those tools that we no longer need as long as we have our trusted cell phone at hand. Some of them have evolved to adapt to life at the bottom of the food chain, others have quietly disappeared.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re about to remember devices once considered indispensible, now fearing extinction at the hands of mobile phones. Some of the items on this red list will be missed it seems ? others we were more than pleased to throw in the dumpster. But that?s the way of evolution: you need to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the conclusions were pretty much expected (the death of devices like personal organizers was obviously only a matter of time), while other were somewhat surprising (wristwatches took a major hit too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, full of fond memories of the good old times, we start our tour after the break. First on our list is the forerunner of the SMS ? the pager ? a single click down memory lane.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pagers (beepers)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Pagers a.k.a beepers are now all but extinct. There was a time when they had their uses of course but one-way communication is not even close to what mobile phones can offer. There is simply no room left for them now. When Richard Jarvis of Vodafone received the first SMS in December 1992, pagers were doomed from that point on (extra points to those of you who can quote the actual message*).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It all started in 1959, when Motorola ? who else ? made the first pager. It did take 15 long years for those devices to achieve some market success. Again, it was Motorola and their Pageboy I that made the breakthrough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In those dark times, pagers could neither store, nor display the messages. All they did was alert the user that a message had been received and the user had to call a number and get it. Plus, they only worked as short-range receivers and their use was pretty limited ? mostly to on-site communication such as in hospitals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the early 90s, pagers got wide-range broadcasting support, which unlocked their full potential and made them as attractive as they ever got.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of users exceeded 20 millions shortly after and only four years later, they were already over 60 million. However mobile phones started their quick ascent right about then and pushed pagers out of the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pagers did try to evolve but nothing could save them. Adding sending message and email capabilities may have delayed their death, but that just wasn?t enough to keep them floating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today, virtually every mobile phone out there will give you seriously better email capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pagers? last line of defense nowadays remain the so called "critical messaging" markets. Their reliability makes them very suitable for such purposes as they never stop working in times of trouble. Immune to the network overload problems that cellphones suffer, pagers have been used in the aftermaths of disasters such as the September 11 attacks or the Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So pagers are enjoying such a small market share today that no manufacturers find it sensible to invest in their development and manufacturing. We are probably seeing the last days of these dinosaurs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sales are so small that no one bothers reporting them anymore. Certainly an indication that there?s just no future for the technology and it will soon become history. A clear victory for cell phones here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Street pay phones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In their glory days, they stood proud on every corner, a cheap and easy way for people to make ? and even receive ? a call. Well, times have vastly changed and the service they offer is obsolete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s mostly a one-way connection (even if some pay phones can receive calls) and that?s not quite as convenient as cell phones of course. And you obviously cannot carry it with you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the advent of mobile phones, most large companies and service providers started quitting and that made achieving competitive pricing simply impossible. It?s hard to be competitive when you have limited resources and this is a pretty uphill battle to begin with, so most just gave up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s put things into some perspective here by showing you how rapidly those pay phones are disappearing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first payphone emerged as far back as 1889, but at the time attendants had to collect the cash manually. 13 years later the number of payphones surpassed 80 thousands in the US alone and the increased financial interest naturally led to quick growth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speed of technological evolution back then wasn?t quite the same as today but still in 1905 the world got the first outdoor public payphone. Then numbers continued to grow and in 1960 reached 7 digits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the peak of their form, in the year 2000 there were more than 2 million of those on streets in the US alone. They kept that level for a while before eventually starting going downhill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The short two-year period of 2007 and 2008 alone saw more than half (58 percent to be precise) of all street phones disappear. Today there are only about 700 000 pay phones left in the US and we are only going to see a further decline in that number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while there are little officially posted numbers for other countries the picture is perhaps quite similar. This is all, of course, logical, there is no way for the past to be reconciled with the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So are we about to see the last of them payphones? They will disappear eventually but it?s hardly going to be fast. Phone booths are still being used as advertising media and London has them as one of its most popular sights so they seem to have secured a few more years of existence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the prices of mobile phones and calls continue to fall, there?ll be less and less room for phone booths. Even the tiny investment for their construction and support will make little economical sense. And in the telecom business, like in any other business, it?s all about the Benjamins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So there you have it ? another doomed species that mobile phones will kick out of business. Let?s see what comes up next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>*It said "Happy Christmas".</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fixed-line telephones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Most of us still have one of those at home but the wired is taking big hits from the wireless yet again and we are afraid those won't be with us for much longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Landlines allow two-way communication, plus they need much lower investment to get going and thus cost less, which makes them pretty suitable for developing markets. That allowed fixed phones to continue to grow in popularity even after cell phones became widespread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the turn of the 21st century, fixed-line handsets were gaining in market share all over the world as they were still notably cheaper than mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes like this: everyone is willing to sacrifice mobility if the price is right. When the difference between cell phones and landlines falls below that price, users start to switch teams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This moment came somewhere around the year 2000 for most of the developed world, when landlines market share stopped growing. A couple of years later they were already losing ground quickly with the number of subscribers per 100 residents falling from 57 to 50 in just under five years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What gives us enough ground to say it is the slowing growth of landlines in developing markets. Until 2006, less developed countries grew fast enough to make up for the losses sustained in advanced markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the negative trend surpassed the positive and now the decline is faster than the rise. So with less than 19 people out of 100 having a fixed line phone in 2007 globally, things look bad enough on their own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Excluding the corporate world, landlines are getting less common for home users and thus giving up on them becomes all the easier. There will just be fewer people to stay in touch with that way. It's obvious there will be probably be quite some time before they are completely gone in developed countries (and even longer in the rest of the world). Perhaps they will slowly turn from telephones into plain DSL delivering lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now that we are done with the means of communication that cell phones have replaced (or inherited if you will), we'll look aside at what other devices will forever curse the day when mobile phones were invented.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>PDAs and personal organizers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OK, those are actually newer species but had a part in the ecosystem in the teething years of mobile phones. At the time, mobile manufacturers were all busy inventing the internal antenna and fitting 2G radios in something you can actually hold in one hand, so they just didn't have time to waste on PIM features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smartphones weren't even born yet and people were perfectly happy with a handset that could only make calls. Storing data and handling contact information had to be assigned to another device (phones used to only have SIM memory, remember?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were plenty of those electronic organizers coming from all over the world. Unluckily for them once Nokia came up with the first communicator - the Nokia 9000 monster, which officially downgraded the organizer to a phone feature, rather than a stand-alone device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still a substantial number of touch-driven PDAs were to remain on the market for a while longer, as they were cheaper and a bit more compact than the ones that could make calls. But we all knew this wasn't going to last long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cellular radios were quickly getting smaller and cheaper, until it made no sense to omit them on dedicated PDAs. The price gap between cell phones and PDAs was getting thinner and there was absolutely no point in carrying two devices instead of one, doing all the work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You know what followed shortly after - each and every mobile nowadays can give you better organizing features than the best of the electronic organizers in the past. PDAs got a bit higher up the food chain so you will probably need a smartphone to comfortably top all their functionality, but that's not that much more to ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, most of the big PDA manufacturers joined the mobile phone race, following the good old "If you can't beat them, join them!" formula. Sony were there from very early on - first on their own and later in cooperation with Ericsson. Dell, on the other hand, are just now starting but their first offerings are more than promissing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple, who started the whole PDA thing with the Newton-powered MessagePad are now considering the iPhone their flagship product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some others, like HP for example even managed to convert the successful line of iPAQ PDAs into a line of mobile phones. They were creating some pretty interesting handsets before deciding that keeping pace is too demanding on their budget and quit business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are now witnessing their return though, as HP purchased the last of the big names in the PDA game - Palm. Unlike HP, Palm decided to go all in with mobile phones and developed a whole new OS of their own, but they run out of cash before their investment started to pay off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dedicated SatNav units<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Dedicated SatNav units date back to 1990, when Mitsubishi Electric and Pioneer introduced the first GPS-based auto navigation systems. Due to the patchy map data available and the questionable accuracy of the GPS modules at the time, we wouldn?t call it a flying start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Five years later, Oldsmobile introduced the first GPS navigation system available in a production car, but that hardly made it mass market too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In 2000, the US military declared they would stop intentionally degrading the GPS signal (it took a good 6 year to actually complete) and the popularity of personal SatNav units exploded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rapid development of technology was of great help of course. GPS receivers were becoming smaller, power consumption was reduced, without compromising accuracy. Processing power improved, memory prices went down and map data was greatly improved so those personal navigators became actually usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PDAs and Windows Mobile smartphones (or PocketPCs as we called them back in the day) were the first to have a go at a piece of that market, but they failed to do dedicated SatNav units much damage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither their screens, nor their performance was quite up to standard. Not to mention that a dedicated voice-guidance software application for those used to cost an arm and a leg.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But as mobile phones became more powerful, and their screen estate and quality skyrocketed, SatNav on a phone started to look like a more viable option. GPS modules cost pennies to manufacture so it?s not an obstacle either and there is already quite a few apps that give you voice-guided navigation for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia were the first to give free lifetime navigation with their smartphones. Next were Google and considering the huge potential of the Android platform this might be an even bigger milestone. Google is still unable to roll out their service worldwide, but you can bet they will get there eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leading SatNav manufacturers Garmin seemed to have no choice but go into mobile phones too. Is it that they?re starting to realize that their traditional business is a dead-end street?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether or not they are ready to switch sides, others have already figured out most of the tricks so there isn?t that much that they can contribute. The prices of dedicated SatNavs are meanwhile about to hit rock bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best of those hardly cost more than a couple of hundred bucks, while in the past flagships used to go for nearly a thousand. There?s just very little (or even none at all) advantage that one of those units have, even over mediocre smartphones. The battery life is on their side, but that only counts when used for pedestrian navigation as a car charger costs next to nothing and will give you all the endurance you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most offer a decently sensitive GPS receiver (which A-GPS makes even faster), good sunlight legibility and screen size, with a sufficiently fast interface on top. What?s more constant internet connection means live updating of POIs, map data and whatnot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in the future voice-guided Satellite Navigation will certainly become a territory exclusive to smartphones, as its pioneers are just unable to offer any kind of response to their onward march. It?s just that progress is one of those things driven by money, and the mobile phone industry seems to have it in excess.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>MP3 players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For a change we turn to a class of devices that hasn?t lost the war just yet. MP3 players have been taking heavy blows recently but there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it?s not like dedicated MP3 players suddenly pressed fast forward on their evolution to save their butts. Mobile phones seem to have shot themselves in the foot instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A mobile phone can easily give you as good audio quality as your mp3 player nowadays and can match the battery life too. Or at least that?s what the specs claim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the fine print reads that a cell phone can only give you north of 20 hours of music playback in standby mode without doing anything else. With all radios off and all applications but the music player closed. So a phone can only properly replace an mp3 player if it acts as one. But that doesn?t make much sense now, does it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So all those naysayers who foretold the end of dedicated MP3 player, the minute they saw the Siemens SL45, have been proven wrong so far. This is not to say those players haven?t suffered much damage. Their prices have dropped dramatically and that in turn reduces the profit they make and the investments they could justify.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When they reached the point of being no more expensive than a spare battery for your mobile phone, MP3 players were safe. But that?s not quite the existence they dreamt of. The iPod family has been trying to make a difference since 2001. It certainly contributed to the survival of the whole class (though iPods are now accounting for more than half of all sales).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple are the only ones capable of pushing large quantities of more expensive players. The iPod touch makes great use of the R&amp;D the company did for its mobile phone and so becomes a multi-functional device in its own right. But even Apple are feeling the heat on the iPods. Their music players are the only devices they produce that have lower sales figures this quarter (by 8 percent) compared to last year?s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So unlike most of the heroes in this sad story, the MP3 players have been evolving from the day of their invention. And that?s quite a long period considering that the first MP3 player came in 1979, delivering the vast 3.5 minutes of audio playback. Now, how impressive is that?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next were Audio Highway with their Listen Up player in 1996 and the Koreans Saehan Information Systems, who released the MPMan in 1998. Back then most of the world was still crazy about portable CD players and chances are most of you had one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But unlike the now long dead CD players, MP3 players will stay for a little while. So we?ll just call it a tie here and move on to the next item on the cell phone menu.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Calculators<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ah calculators? the unicellular organisms of technology. Considered by some as the main driving force behind the computer evolution, those never managed to get past the 2-line monochrome display or learn any new tricks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once the calculators become small and energy-efficient enough in the 1970s, they called it a day. Little to none has been done about adding new functionality or anything (unless you count those cheap wristwatch calculators).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s why their fate was sealed as far back as 2004, when Nokia 6630 added the square root to the usual set of simple functions. Come on now, hardened accountants are more than likely to still have a calculator on their desk but human users say No, thanks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smartphones have a host of mathematical functions on their calculator apps and they have CPUs 100 times faster than a regular calculator. And if the preinstalled one doesn?t do the job, well, there?s another app for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notice that we didn?t even mention some more cool features that mobile phones have, such as switching between regular and scientific mode with a flick of the hand thanks to the accelerometer. No argument here, doing your math homework will never be the same again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alarm clocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alarm clocks have been around for ages. The first of them date back to ancient Greece, when time keeping was a luxury. But having made the trip from sundials to clock towers to the small radio-enabled devices on our night shelves safely, they find themselves in real trouble now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Really, is there anything an alarm clock can do that a cell phone can?t do just as well, if not better? Well, okay to be honest there are quite a few of those, but none is really relevant to most users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let?s look at what cell phones give you ? a choice between all the available tunes in the world is the first thing that springs to mind. Turn-to-snooze is a close second, as it works better than any snooze button on a dedicated alarm clock, no matter how big it is. Finally, you get to set up as many alarms as you want and you can also assign each a short description so you won?t wonder what?s going on when it sets off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, if your phone is switched off it will still wake up to set off the alarm. We?d call that a clean victory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But no, this is not to say that alarm clocks will shortly disappear. They are practically going for pennies and they aren?t so much of a nuisance that people will want to get rid of them. So they will live on, even if driven more by nostalgia and the power of habit than any technological superiority.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wristwatches<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two sides to the story of wristwatches and mobile phones. A cell phone is a device that?s always on you and can tell the time with reasonable accuracy, making it pointless to carry another similar device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed little kids are now learning to tell time by looking at a mobile phone, rather than a Barbie/Superman (scratch the wrong one) watch, attached to their wrist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, a wristwatch is a fashion accessory, a perfect complement to your wardrobe and there?s very few mobile phones that can do the job. Though there are some that try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Low-end watches, which are mostly bought for their time-telling functionality, are now facing a tough challenge. If they won?t make you look any cooler, you better save the money (however little it may be) and simply buy a slightly better phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>High-end watches however were never meant to be anything but a symbol ? it?s the status, not the timekeeping. Their sales didn?t suffer one bit because of mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, mobile phones won?t be calling time on the watch industry. And it certainly won?t be wrist watch phones that will challenge the status quo. Luxury watch-makers will produce an occasional limited-edition hand-crafted marvel of a phone. So it goes. Forever.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Digital cameras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Almost every cellphone out there carries a digital camera on its back nowadays. Phones even do nice video recordings, so the situation for point-and-shoot digital camera can?t be that good, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, it seems they are still holding up despite the impressive leaps of improvement in cellphone digital imaging. But the pressure from this direction plus the global economic downturn has cost them more than 14 percent shrinking of the total volumes shipped in 2009 as compared to 2008 according to the international Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association. Just for the record, DSLR sales in 2009 didn?t shrink below the levels of 2008 so that should tell you it?s only point-and shoots are feeling the heat. Not to mention that in 2009 the average price of the point-and-shoot cameras feel down to almost 70% of what it used to be in 2008.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we?re not saying budget digicams will go obsolete anytime soon, however mobile phone are certainly a force to be reckoned with on the digicam market as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Portable game consoles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Mobile phones may not have the tradition in serious mobile gaming but in recent times they?ve been pressuring dedicated portable gaming consoles quite successfully. For a gaming ecosystem is as big as the games available in it and the developers focus is rapidly shifting towards mobile phones with big screens, a variety of on-board sensors, advanced operating systems and hardware graphics acceleration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first go mobile phones had at portable gaming consoles came too early and was rather unsuccessful. The Nokia N-Gage platform was an interesting idea but hardware wasn't ready to deliver good enough performance for it and it wasn't marketed well enough to attract enough attention from both customers and developers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Recently large-screened touch-driven phones seem almost ready to drive PSP and DS out of the market. It all started with the iPhone and its App store, which is still in the lead as far as mobile gaming is concerned. However, Android seems to be catching up too and plenty of interesting titles start to appear in the Android Market too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's not just about the availability of game titles ? it?s also the new way we play them. Mobile phones offer more sensors (like accelerometers, cameras, gyroscopes and compasses), which allow them to deliver more immersive gaming experiences and that should attract more and more fans in the future. There are plenty of games out there best suited for touchscreen phones with those sensors and the gameplay feels much better on them than on dedicated consoles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interconnectivity via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth also offer an innovative way of doing multiplayer ? each player on their own phone, but all in the same room. And that is a niche that?s just in the beginning of its development.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only precondition for ultimate gaming that most phones are missing on is hardware keys (or rather more, larger and more comfortable hardware keys). Since the dawn of days gaming was thought with hardware keys in mind and naturally the best titles are developed for such operation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may not be long before someone starts offering external controllers that attach to mobile phones and make them all but perfect for gamers on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even if mobile phones do get the portable consoles beat all over it will take some time for them to disappear. They have been around for quite a while now and have a huge fan base, which is hard to persuade to switch ships. Besides you can get a portable console, a bag of hit titles and that would still cost you much less than a high-end phone (which is currently the only hardware that?s any good for the proper mobile phone gaming).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So yeah, portable consoles are already starting a path down, but they certainly have a few more years in front of them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The end? or far from it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All right then, it?s an open-ended story and the most logical question would be who?s next. The list of endangered species is likely to grow longer but it doesn?t have to be gadgets only. Aren?t privacy and proper manners on the phone?s kill list already?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We may think we know what?s next in mobile phones. Imaging has evolved enough to unsettle some low-end digicams and camcorders. Projector phones are coming up, there?s motion-based gaming, location-based services have huge potential. Mobile money transfers are a huge thing on developing markets.</paragraph>
