			<paragraph>Huawei has just unveiled its new Ascend Mate 2 phablet here at CES 2014, and we've got all the juicy details for you to sink your teeth into.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes are mostly cosmetic with this second generation, as Huawei has managed to squeeze in the same 6.1" 720p screen, 2GB of RAM, and 4050 mAh battery into a package that cuts 2.5mm in height, 1mm in width, and is 0.4mm thinner.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Here are the specs at-a-glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei has decided to opt out of the home-grown K3V2 chipset for this latest iteration, going for a Snapdragon 400 SoC instead. Imaging has been upgraded as well, with the Mate 2 sporting a 13MP Sony-made primary cam and a 5MP front-facer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, the memory has been doubled to 16GB, and there's a 4G LTE antenna with support for a plethora of both TDD-LTE and FDE-LTE bands. This latter feature Huawei hopes will help market the phablet in the North American market.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Up next we've got our first impressions as well as hands-on images of the device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend Mate 2 4G hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's no secret we like the Huawei Ascend Mate - we've recommended it twice in our shopping guides so far. That's about to change though as the Ascend Mate 2 4G brings some refinements to the original that we think may be worth it (depending on the price, of course, Huawei hasn't announced anything about it yet).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new phablet keeps the screen at 6.1" 720p (that's 241ppi). It's not the sharpest display, but for a mid-range phablet it's quite alright. It's an LTPS LCD, so viewing angles are good and it's covered with Gorilla Glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate 2 4G is a couple of millimeters shorter and narrower than the original, it's a bit slimmer too (9.5mm vs. 9.9mm). It weighs just as much as the original, but the smaller bezels do make a difference in how it feels in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We just wish Huawei kept the matte plastic on the back, we're not fans of the glossy new one. The back cover pops off to reveal the SIM and microSD card slots, but the battery is sealed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the size saving, the battery still has the monstrous 4,050mAh capacity - it offered great battery life with Huawei's less than efficient quad-core Cortex-A9 chipset, but with the new quad-core Cortex-A7 it should be an absolute beast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official numbers say 60 hours of normal use (whatever that is) and 12 hours straight of web browsing (the original did about 8 hours in our battery test, we can't wait to put this one through its paces). Huawei is so certain of the battery that the Mate 2 can actually charge other phones (obviously, you'll need the appropriate USB cable).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the chipset upgrade also adds LTE connectivity - it's Cat. 4 too, meaning it can do 150Mbps down and 50Mbps up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more - the camera department got a big upgrade too. The main camera has a 13MP BSI sensor from Sony, 28mm lens and f/2.0 aperture. It can record 1080p video. The front facing camera is even more interesting - a 5MP camera, with f/2.4 aperture and 1.4µ pixels. Hear that, HTC One?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate 2 4G runs Android 4.3 with Emotion UI 2.0. Huawei is intent on bringing the Mate 2 to the US, with AT&amp;T being suggested as the likely carrier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei also had colorful protective cases for the Ascend Mate 2 4G on display.</paragraph>
