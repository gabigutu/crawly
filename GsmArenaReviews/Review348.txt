			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nokia N76 in black and red</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not so long ago phones with open OS, the so called smartphones, were significantly bigger than standard feature phones. And it was just size that would often deter users from purchasing a smartphone. Nowadays, however, smartphones are slowly assuming the dimensions of standard phones. The new Nokia N76 - the first slim clamshell based on Symbian S60 is a brilliant example of this trend.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tracing RAZR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A single glimpse at the elegant curves of the new Nokia N76 reveals clearly and immediately that the Finns have drawn from the experience of the competition. N76's design unmistakably resembles elements of Motorola RAZR, which was the first mobile of a slim clamshell body featuring a flat etched keypad. Along with these two characteristics Nokia has also adopted the famous Motorola "chin" naturally associated with RAZR. Anyway, Nokia has given N76 a real flashy look. The phone is attractive and stands out among other smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Nokia has drawn from the experience of Motorola</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In dimensional aspect Nokia N76 is an above-average clamshell. It is bigger than common phones (106.5 x 52 mm), but also extremely slim - its thickness is mere 13.7 mm. The phone weighs 115 grams. Nokia N76 is going to be offered in two color versions: a decent black one that will surely catch the fancy of gentlemen and a more attractive red one that will definitely be preferred by ladies. The model we have been testing is black. It features a lot of plastic elements that look rather cheap, which does not respond to a high-class phone. Nokia N76 deserved more steel. Yet, the real disaster is somewhere else: the awful susceptibility of the phone to fingerprints, visible on its entire surface: on the black matt plates, on the protecting glass of the external display, on the silver band winding the phone? In other words, cleaning is going to be a full-time job for the N76 owner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slimness follows the latest fashion trends ? buttons beneath the external display ? the external display is hidden behind protecting glass</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the external display is active and is TFT, its legibility behind the glossy cover is poor. Legibility is especially limited under direct sunlight. The good news is that it displays 262K colors on a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels. Beneath the external display you will find three easy-to-manage keys controlling the music player and the FM radio. Their legends are illuminated. There are more external keys on the right side of the phone: a dual volume control key, a camera release button, and a key for an instant view of the last image made. A tiny connector for the charger is also situated here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Three control elements on the right side ? charger connector is almost invisible ? the "chin" including the loud speaker</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The standard jack is always welcome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectors are on the top of the phone body: a standard protected miniUSB connector and a standard 3.5 mm jack (a very unusual, but welcomed decision on behalf of Nokia, as this connector permits users to plug into the phone any type of headphones). The last element on the top of the phone is the on/off button, which can also be used for changing ringing profiles. Situating a major part of the connectors on the top of the body was not a happy solution, though, because plugging a device in them limits opening. Another inconvenience is the inaccessibility of the on/off button when the phone is open, which makes changing ringing profiles impossible too. The bottom of the phone only features an eye-let for a wrist band and a handsfree slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; 3.5mm jack, miniUSB connector and switch-off button on the top of the phone ? the cap of the memory card slot does not stick perfectly </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, a great part of the rear plate consists of the battery cover that also incorporates the "chin". It is made of trivial plastic material and is not easy to remove. In the bottom of the battery cover you will see a rubber stub, which prevents the phone from sliding on even surfaces. Nokia N76 has a Li-Ion battery of moderate capacity (700 mAh). A single charge is said to provide the phone with enough energy for 165 minutes of talk time or 204 hours on stand-by. In reality, Nokia N76 requires charging every 2 to 3 days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera is untraditionally situated on the back ? accompanied by the LED flash</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card is inserted in an untraditional way: you have to first place it into a yellow drawer and then insert it into the phone body. The 2 megapixel camera, represented by a non-protected lens and a flash LED, is situated above the battery cover. A few millimeters aside you will also see the slot for microSD memory card, whose silver protection cap does not fit nicely (at least in our test unit). An additional 256MB card is enclosed in the retail package. Nokia N76 works great with 1GB memory cards too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Keypad: beauty at the cost of efficiency<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The joint is quite rigid and requires time and effort before one gets used to it. The phone features a facilitating spring, but it is no big help, either. The top half of the phone jumps open to a stop position by itself, so you need to push it through the rest of its way with your fingers. Nokia N76 can be also opened with a single hand, but this operation requires getting used to it and is not really comfortable. The opening angle is big enough; the joint is solid and shows insignificant play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nokia N76's elegant design has not been backed up by good-quality materials, unfortunately</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flat etched keypads are the style today. Besides, a keypad with elevated keys would have not suited this slim body at all. Flat keypads look cool, but tend to be less user-friendly. Nokia N76's keypad is no exception to the rule. Its keys don't feature touch separators, which inevitable leads to frequent typing errors. Tactile feedback is not positive, either. The delete and the editing keys wedged in between the navigation key and the numerical keys block are extremely small - bad news for users with large fingers. Along with the obligatory "pencil" key on the keypad you will also see a "Symbian" key that provides access to the main menu and a multimedia key for instant access to a selection of multimedia functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Unusual joint form ? the flat keypad requires practice, but its design is really cool </paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that every user will get accustomed to Nokia N76's keypad sooner or later. On the other hand there is no doubt that the phone is not made for keen texters, either. The keys legends including key contours are illuminated in flashy green at night. Backlighting is regulated by a light-sensitive sensor for the purpose of energy saving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Keypad background is very impressive</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Millions on the display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main 2.4" display is great. It's a 16M color TFT one with a QVGA resolution (240 x 320 pixels). The brightness of the display image can be adjusted from the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;The main display is brilliant ? not only the main display, but also the keys beneath it are illuminated</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display there is a tiny, almost invisible camera lens for video calls. It works at CIF+ resolution, that is, 384 x 320 pixels. Apart from video calls it can also be used for self-portraits and video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The external display on stand-by ? when somebody is calling and when a call has been missed ? selecting a ringing profile</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Symbian<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The heart of Nokia N76 is its Symbian 9.2 OS. It uses the well known graphic user interface S60 3rd edition. Beside, Nokia has improved it by adding Feature Pack 1, which we first experienced in the high-class N95. The strongest advantage of Feature Pack 1 is its repeated alarm clock and the fact that its voice recorder is not limited to a mere minute, but to an hour. Nothing else but these two applications has undergone modifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stand-by display with and without stand-by mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stand-by display naturally features an active stand-by mode. Yet, we find it rather simplified in comparison to the stand-by mode applied in the new Nokia S40 3rd Edition models: for example, you cannot freely reorganize its elements. In result, you have a band with icons for instant access to pre-selected functions in the top of the display and upcoming events from the calendar together with tasks in its bottom. In the bottom area of the display you will also find the title of the running song or the name of the tuned radio station. Text notes are not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The background of the stand-by display as well as its menu can be modified using various themes ? Nokia N76 offers 6 pre-installed themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shortcuts can be assigned to both context keys as well as to all ways of the navigations key and to its confirming center as long as the stand-by mode is off. Other 4 functions can be assigned to the menu, opened by a press on the Multimedia key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;The four possible images of the main menu ? the last two are really impressive, but not so practical</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Font size can be changed in three steps</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic configuration of the main menu is presented by a matrix with icons. Eventually, you could also display it as a standard list, in the form of a horseshoe animated list or in the form of a V-shaped animated list. The last two options are very impressive, but of little practical use. Icons can be reorganized or moved into a different menu folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nokia N76 includes Feature Pack 1 ? running applications ? instant access to multimedia functions ? a sub-menu level</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N76's menu is browsed fast. As soon as you try a more complicated operation, however, the phone will make you wait for a few seconds. Of course, the speed, with which the phone reacts, depends on the number of simultaneously running applications. Their list can be seen in the form of a Task Manager accessible through a longer press on the Symbian key. A great part of the applications supported by Nokia N76 get terminated if you use the red-receiver key to exit them. However, this does not hold true for the radio and the music player, which only get minimized. To download new applications from any computer you can use the proprietary program Nokia PC Suite or download them straight into the phone via data transfers. In order to do so, use the folder Download; this shows an upgraded portfolio with applications available on Nokia?s website.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two megapixels on the back<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N76 has a 2 megapixel camera (maximum image size is 1600 x 1200 pixels) with the lens occupying an unusual place for a clamshell - on the back of the phone. The lens is not protected and lacks auto focus. It is accompanied by a fairly powerful LED flash offering the following modes: automatic, always, with red-eye effect correction, and off. The flash LED cannot be used as a flashlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera viewfinder (with the minimized music player running in background) ? camera menu and exposure settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can take pictures with both open and closed phone, but always in a landscape mode - this is also the specific reason for the placement of the camera lens. Furthermore. this way the fingers of your right hand will lie perfectly on the side release button. Both displays offer an extensive camera menu with numerous setup options including exposure compensation, self-timer, white balance, color effects, 6 light modes, and even ISO sensitivity setup. Image size, release sound and other details are set up from deeper menu levels. The digital zoom reaches up to 20x. However, the more you zoom in the respective object, the worse the picture quality is.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Color effects:</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Images made under bad light conditions:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;The LED flash works well at short distance ? for distant objects you'd better apply night mode without flash </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exposure compensation:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N76 makes pictures of average quality. Colors are dull, with a slight purple tinge; noise is too visible. The camera has difficulties with high contrast areas and doesn't deal well with macro images. Text captured on a picture is virtually illegible. On the other hand, the camera records videos in MP4 and 3GP formats with maximum resolution of 320 x 240 pixels, which is good news. Record length is only limited by the available free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Gallery ? surfing existing pictures ? application Lifeblog ? memory indicator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are saved in the folder "Gallery", where you can also view other multimedia files kept in the phone. N76 offers an interesting application called Lifeblog, where all pictures available in the phone are displayed onto a time axis including those sent out or received in messages. The internal memory of the phone is 26 MB, but can be easily extended up to 2 GB by using microSD memory cards.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and messages in Symbian style<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N76 offers the same communication functions like other phones based on Symbian S60. The number of both contacts and messages is only limited by the available free memory. The phonebook is detailed and can fit in numerous details. The contacts saved on the SIM card are displayed separately. The phonebook is searched through gradual typing of the initials of the searched contact, even though a predictive searching mode would have been more suitable. Naturally, contacts can be organized into groups, each of which can be assigned a specific ringtone as well as voice dialed. Nokia N76 offers relatively good voice control; you can switch between profiles or activate Bluetooth without having to teach the phone any additional voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Phonebook ? searching ? contact detail ? working in the contacts' menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing profiles set up the entire audio performance of the phone. Their settings are extensive, as usual. Call filters and Airplane mode are available, as well. Of course, the phone can work without a SIM card. Nokia N76 works in GSM networks at the following frequencies: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz. Video calls are supported in 3G UMTS networks at frequency of 2100 MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp;Caller groups ? number of contacts ? ringing profiles and its settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editor is the same like in other Symbian phones. It manages SMS, MMS and emails and offers three font size options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Message menu ? selecting message type ? list with received messages ? reading SMS in a small and medium font </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client works with SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4 protocols. It can manage more than one account simultaneously and transfers attachments. It can download email headers only or regularly check newly received emails too. The phone has a special application called "Setup guidebook" to help you set up an email account. Along with standard message types here you will also find audio messages, sent out via MMS. "Push to talk" is available too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Poor work with Word and Excel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Finnish manufacturer presents Nokia N76 as a "multimedia computer", which explains the lack of office and work functions in the phone. For example, the phone has no viewer for Microsoft Word and Excel documents (you can download such a viewer, if necessary, though). Yet, a viewer for PDF files does appear in the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Month, week, and day view at the calendar ? setup options for the calendar ? the task manager is part of the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar is standard. It offers a month, a week, and a day view. You can insert four event types: meeting, note, anniversary, and task. Meetings can be repeated daily, weekly, every two weeks, every month, and every year. Tasks can be displayed separately and marked off once accomplished.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; The application Clock contains a detailed and repeated alarm clock as well as world time </paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the folder "Organiser" you will find text notes, a unit converter, a simple calculator, and a voice recorder which can make records of up to 60 minutes. The voice recorder can also be used as a call recorder. The phone is well equipped for connection to a wireless Bluetooth keypad and GPS module, of which the applications featured by the menu are sufficient evidence.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Entertainment is what matters<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N76's primary purpose is to entertain users and thus its functions are designed to perfectly meet the needs for multimedia fun. It offers a great music player manageable through external keys and thus controllable even with a closed phone. The player works with MP3, AAC, eAAC, eAAC+, and WMA formats. It first indexes music files and then names them according to the available ID3 tags. Songs can be sorted by various criteria and organized in playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  &nbsp;Music player ? songs can be sorted by various criteria</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The function for displaying the most frequently played and the last played songs is quite interesting. The player has an equalizer and a pair of video visualizations too. The player is constantly active, even if it's not used, which is rather unusual. It cannot be deactivated at all, which might be considered a con by some users as it slows down the phone and occupies precious operational memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; &nbsp;There are two visualizations available in the music player ? FM radio ? list with stations ? Real Player &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also offers a FM radio. Its main con is the lack of RDS, its plus - it can store up to 50 radio stations. Videos are played in the famous Real Player. A flash animations player is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music player can be easily controlled from the external display &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same holds true for the integrated FM radio</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphones delivered in the retail package of the phone are pretty good. They hold well in one's ears and produce good-quality sound. You can hang them around your neck thanks to a special black strip. If you do not like the original earphones, feel free to plug another model. The 3.5mm jack makes this possible, which is great. Bluetooth does not support A2DP and thus excludes the use of wireless earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp; The earphones enclosed in the retail package are quite good ? their tiny control box including a microphone on the cable has new design; they also feature a special strip, thanks to which you can hang them around your neck</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one game in the phone - 3D snake. If you want to download other games you'd better use Symbian-based instead of Java-based as the latter is rather slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The snake is the only available game in the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>jBenchmark results:</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Minimizing data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as data transfers are concerned, Nokia N76 does not offer what is expected. Data transfers are backed by UMTS at a maximum transferring speed of 384 kbps. If you don't have a good 3G signal at your location you might have to put up with EDGE or GPRS. There is no HSDPA support. The lack of Wi-Fi is an even more serious obstacle, though. The phone has Bluetooth 2.0 and offers a connection to a miniUSB connector through a data cable. A data cable is enclosed in the retail package together with the phone. Once you have connected it, N76 will offer you 4 modes to choose from: PC Suite for synchronization, Data transfers for Mass Storage, Image print via PictBridge, and a Media player for connection to applications in Windows Media Player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Yahoo! Search engine is also available ? the Log counting the amount of transferred data</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N76 is supplemented by a CD including a number of useful applications, like the new Nokia PC Suite, Nokia Lifeblog, and Adobe Photoshop Album for work with pictures, Nokia Multimedia Player and Nokia Music Manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser in landscape mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us now say a few words about the web browser integrated in Nokia N76. It is the same as the one used in all previous handsets based on Symbian 9.1 S60 3rd edition. Along with WAP pages it also opens fully-working Internet pages, and all of these can be browsed in landscape mode. Font size and graphics are user-configurable, of course. The phone offers an application called Setup Guidebook, which will help you set up data transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Inconsistent personality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N76 is a controversial device. On one hand it presents itself as an elegant phone of modern slim design and high-tech functions underlined by the presence of a brilliant display and Symbian 9.2 with S60 3.1. On the other hand, however, a closer look reveals several significant drawbacks: cheap-looking plastic material, expressed susceptibility to fingerprints, which requires constant cleaning? You?'d better put gloves on your hands, if you try to show off with your new N76? In terms of hardware we should mention the flatness of the keypad resulting in uncomfortable usage of the latter as well as the impossibility to fully open the phone when earphones are connected to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Accessories: data cable, earphones and 256MB memory card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The situation regarding the functions of the phone is similar. Picture quality does not fascinate at all; data transfers cannot be fully made use of because of the absence of Wi-Fi and HSDPA. A2DP Bluetooth profile necessary for connecting wireless earphones is missing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum up, Nokia N76 can be considered an interesting purchasing option mainly by people who refer to their phone as to a stylish fashionable accessory and do not care about its functional abilities too much. On the other hand, exactly such clientele will remain disappointed with the cheap looking plastic covers and the fingerprint smudges. The cons become even more visible when combined with the high price of the phone. As you can see, sales records are the last Nokia N76 is expected to achieve.</paragraph>
