			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 XpressMusic is set to play for it all in the mass market segment. A bunch of music niceties, slim waistline and novel design are crowned with the XpressMusic logo, and that's enough of a commitment to cool sonic experience. The gentle price tag only makes things all the sweeter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the new XpressMusic mid-ranger needs to make an epic run. It follows in the wake of Nokia 5310, which the house claims to be the best selling music phone in the world with more than 10 million units sold globally. So, no wonder we start this review with a bag full of mixed feelings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 is priced quite close to Nokia 5310 and, while obviously positioned below (model designation), it manages to outperform it in quite a few tasks. Well then, besides exploring the newcomer today, we will also be trying to resolve a rather challenging XpressMusic dilemma for all music-loving fans out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 XpressMusic is breaking free of the traditional bar form factor and that's a nice attempt to spice up the XpressMusic portfolio and turn up the youthful appeal of the lineup. It's a lower midrange handset alright, but it's a style statement in its own right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it's megapixel count and ample touchscreen that gets you excited, you are bound to look elsewhere. But the Nokia 5220 offers a truly music-rich experience at an attractive price tag. If that's your game, hop on and let's see how cool is saying no to symmetry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 XpressMusic is a nice music-centric offering that stays on the path of the most popular music handset by Nokia - 5310 XpressMusic. What could've been an utterly unassuming handset was it not a tad askew, surprisingly manages to address many of the issues of the higher-spec'd 5310. So much so that making the choice between the two seems a tough call now that their price tags are pretty similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this form factor Nokia don't have too much competition for their 5310 and 5220 XpressMusic phones. Sony Ericsson hardly have any ultra slim Walkmans in this price range except perhaps for the elderly Sony Ericsson W880.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson W880</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W302 is also an excellent choice, but the Nokia handsets have more impressive spec sheets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson W302</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung are capable of matching everything Nokia offers in this form factor and market segment with the Samsung M3510 Beat b, which should be available really soon. Plus, the M3510 Beat b tops the XpressMusic lot with shake control and turn-to-mute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung M3510 Beat b</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, competition is not that tough for the Nokia 5220 and its biggest challenge will probably be to emulate the feat of Nokia's own 5310.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5310 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that aside, let's clear the stage for our music star. Tune in after the break as we look at what makes this baby click.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Nokia 5220<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5220 retail box keeps away from the carbon copy design for most Nokia midrange phones and offers some bold colors. In terms of contents, you get a USB data cable, a stereo headset, a charger and a 512MB memory card. That's without counting all the paper and the Nokia PC Suite CD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not bad if you ask us, especially having in mind that the phone is nowhere near the expensive high-enders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 5220 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 banks on asymmetrical design to attract new customers to the brand. At 10.5mm, it's a really thin handset but the plastic build is not really impressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most notable thing about the Nokia 5220 XpressMusic is its shape. The bizarre silhouette though is somewhat inconsistent with the utterly regular plastic body, which didn't manage to win our hearts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of Nokia 5220 is a 2-inch 262K-color unit. Screen estate is relatively small but probably right for the price bracket, while QVGA resolution is quite welcome in this otherwise lower midrange handset. Unfortunately, the display is not the best we've seen from Nokia. The colors are not as vibrant as usual and viewing angles are not as wide as the ones of Nokia 5310 or 6500 classic for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness levels are optimized by the ambient light sensor above the display. The backlighting of the keyboard is excellent and we have no complaints there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the keypad looks are rather cheap, in reality it's quite usable, with high ergonomics. Typing is a breeze and wrong presses are almost completely ruled out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very bottom of the front is a trademark accent of the Nokia 5220. The lanyard eyelet evolves from a mere commodity to a rare design element. The eyelet pierces through the whole body and you can literally see through the hole. It's a strange but overall nice solution - with the aluminum ring being a really nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of Nokia 5220 are the memory card slot and the volume keys. Both elements are so flush with the side panel that you can barely recognize them. That's another score for the Nokia design team.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Memory cards are supported of up to 8GB. We are really glad that Nokia has improved the microSD slot design and now it's accessible without removing the battery cover, unlike the Nokia 5310.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the device is home of the dedicated music keys. Right above them are the backlit key designations, which blink to the rhythm of the music provided that you enable the Music lights feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the same side of the device, right at the top, is the charger port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top side of Nokia 5220 is the 3.5mm audio jack, the microUSB port and the back cover release button. They follow the same unobtrusive design as the side mounted keys. While we are not that impressed with the plastic finish of Nokia 5220, we really enjoyed its ergonomics and practical design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Nokia 5220 XpressMusic is quite upbeat with the prominent Nokia logo and the lanyard puncture. The nice rubbery feel of the plastic back panel and its texture provide a secure anti-slip grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens is here sided by a tiny red LED blinker that also lights up to any playing track. The only thing that lacks here is a flash, but since 5220 XpressMusic camera isn't a key selling point that's not such big a deal really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the back panel you can see the grills of the stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel is effortlessly removed once you release it with the latch that sits at the top. Underneath is the large Nokia BL-5CT Li-Ion battery. It has a capacity of 1020 mAh and it's another thing that beats the Nokia 5310.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The larger capacity battery is said to give Nokia 5220 up to 100 h more of standby time (406 h) and up to 4 h more of dedicated music playback time (24 h). The talk time is the same as the one on 5310 - up to 5 h 20 m.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, we are pretty pleased with the battery life of Nokia 5220. A single charge got us through the whole reviewing routine - which in this case was about six days.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S40 user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the benefits of the S40 UI is the active standby mode. Instead of looking at a plain and boring wallpaper image, you can opt for a more practical layout that turns the standby screen into more of a PC desktop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active standby mode consists of several parts that can be edited or relocated to match the user preferences. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions. The central area provides instant access to the music player. And at the very bottom you will see the calendar events set for the current day. A cool S40 feature, that even Nokia smartphones lack, is the possibility to add a note to the active stand-by. The two soft keys' functionality can also be altered if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu in Nokia 5220 classic can be visualized in four different ways: a grid of icons with or without captions, a list of items, and tabs. While each of them has its pros and cons, our personal choice remains the typical grid view with legends, showing a matrix of 3 x 3 icons. If you prefer more icons to appear on screen, you can go for the grid view without text, as it displays a 4 x 3 icons grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the menu items are intuitively accessible through keyboard shortcuts. The color background of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper on the display, can be easily modified by changing the active theme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu responds quickly, without lagging or holdups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six predefined ringing profiles on Nokia 5220. These should be enough to suit practically any situation you could possible face. The seventh profile is the Flight mode, which turns off all transceivers on the phone. This can turn out very convenient if you decide to use your phone as an MP3-player-only for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, as opposed to some other brands of phones, the flight mode can be used without a SIM card inserted, which we find convenient.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook stores up to 2000 contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Nokia 5220 offers space for up to 2000 contacts. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names eliminating problems, which may occur with synchronization. Ringtones can be assigned to each contact. Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contact list: List-of-Names, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Picture. It can display either the SIM card contacts or the phone memory contacts - having both at the same time is also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook font size can also be modified, should this be necessary, and it's an option that will be widely appreciated. Searching is done by gradual typing of the name of the corresponding contact. And that's not all: contacts can also be organized in groups and these can subsequently be used as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application to mention here is the voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary. There is also a training application that helps for better results when using voice commands and/or dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice extra is the Find-on-Map option which locates the contact's address on the new Nokia Maps application for S40 if it is entered correctly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: Loud and clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might have guessed, signal reception and call clarity have not been compromised in Nokia 5220. The calls are loud and clear on both ends and you will have no problems communicating with this phone. Vibration strength is moderate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 is among the many S40 Nokia phones to feature an active noise cancellation technology for suppressing background noise in calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's about time though Nokia introduced some sort of smart dialing in their feature phones, as most competing manufacturers have already done. It's quite convenient and might save the extra clicks to get to the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 made the Good rank in our loudspeaker test. Compared to Nokia 5310, the 5220 is noticeably louder, especially when playing music on the loudspeaker as seen in the results table. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested mobiles here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 5220 displays Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them in bulk. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nothing has changed in the messaging department and honestly there is no need for that, as it is organized almost perfectly. Besides standard text messages, Nokia 5220 is capable of receiving and sending EMS, MMS, and email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do in order to turn a regular SMS into an MMS is insert a picture or any other multimedia content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and is organized in a practical time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. It goes without saying that the phone also offers a rich T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS. Thanks to the latest MMS 1.3 standard (as opposed to MMS 1.2 in Nokia 5310), size limit for both send and receive is now 600KB instead of 300KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is doing its job pretty well meeting most user needs in this aspect. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email boxes. Even Push email is among the supported standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email setup is now as easy as pie - just enter your email address, and if you use one of the popular public email services (Gmail in our case, but the list contains about 1000 email providers), the handset will automatically fetch the settings for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Sent attachments are not limited in size. Both message headers only and entire messages can be downloaded, depending on your choice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing images is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No significant changes in the gallery were made with Nokia 5220. That's a pity, as we aren't really in love with the looks of the S40 gallery. Probably a part of the problem is that it is used as a file manager too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5220 XpressMusic has 30MB of built-in memory expandable via microSD memory cards. The 5220 officially supports cards of up to 2GB of storage, but as we managed to personally confirm, our retail unit didn't have any problems handling an 8GB card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S40 Gallery has three different views: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is not the fastest around (especially for larger images) and doesn't allow a picture to be zoomed in too closely, so actually it is not much of a help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures can also be viewed fullscreen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter offers a decent amount of options, but you will hardly end up editing your photos on your Nokia 5220.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search options. The latter is quite convenient for finding a specific file in overfed folders but we still believe that the gallery on S40 is not Nokia at their best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That goes true especially in user friendliness and we do hope that sometime in the future the file manager and the gallery will be separate applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual XpressMusic player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Without doubt, the music player is among the most important applications in Nokia 5220. No wonder Nokia have put some effort to its development. Not that they have made any great improvements to the functionality but the new looks are really nice and go well with the overall design of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated music keys are also a boost. They are used for controlling both the music player and the FM radio, their functionality at a given time depending on the last used application. As we already said, the keys backlighting blinks to the rhythm of music if you enable the music light effects option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides managing all the typical functions, the music player also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player is customizable through a number of skins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the A2DP profile is supported, allowing listening on stereo Bluetooth earphones. If you don't like the headset that comes in the retail package, you can easily change it for another thanks to the standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But moving back to the player, we have to say that it offers a large number of configurable options. The sonic experience can be enhanced by an equalizer and a stereo expansion function. There are 7 preset equalizers on Nokia 5220 but you can easily modify two of them to suit your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with the music you have on your Nokia 5220 you can try the FM radio. It shares the audio player interface and can be skinned using the same themes as the music player. RDS is supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Nokia 5310, the FM radio in the 5220 doesn't feature the Visual Radio that enhances the radio experience by adding graphics and visuals to the audio content broadcast by Visual Radio compatible stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of Nokia 5220 is compatible with 3GP and MPEG4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The possibility to remove the soft key captions to make better use of the full screen view mode also improves the viewing experience. Still the 2" screen seems inadequate for truly enjoyable video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As a music-centric handset, Nokia 5220 XpressMusic is supposed to excel in terms of audio quality. As it turns out it is quite up to the task. It's perfectly on par with its sibling - the Nokia 5310. They both have excellent noise levels, dynamic range and fare quite well when it comes to frequency response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand the Nokia 5220 has rather high IMD and THD levels even at the maximum volume level - and their values will increase even further as you lower volume levels. Still these are not all too disturbing, so in terms of audio quality, Nokia 5220 XpressMusic is good enough. You can find more info about the test itself here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The camera hides a trick or two<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5220 XpressMusic is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera with image resolution of up to 1600 x 1200 pixels. There's no flash, and there's no auto focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is more of a complimentary feature on the music-centric 5220.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical of Series 40, the camera settings are not the richest around but are still reasonable for this shooter. They include white balance settings, three quality levels going form basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few things to frown at - there is no cover to protect the lens from scratches, the lack of a flash rules out night portraits, while the fixed focus is sure to ruin any attempt at a close-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a dedicated camera button is another downer when it comes to operating the camera. It is quite uncomfortable to use the confirm button of the D-pad for that purpose, especially when shooting in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera itself is not the best we have seen either, but it's above average and image quality is clearly better than what Nokia 5310 and Nokia 6500 classic can pull off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several samples for you to judge:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There's a performance boost<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were pleasantly surprised by two major camera improvements over previous S40 models - including the Nokia 5310.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First you get a much snappier performance - the Nokia 5310 took ages to save an image, the same goes for the Nokia 6500 classic. This time we have nice shot-to-shot time and saving the image doesn't take too long.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And secondly, the Nokia 5220 is pitched as having the Nokia proprietary processing algorithm (NIPS), which allows for taking better pictures in challenging light conditions. By the way, Nokia 7510 Supernova uses the same technology too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia however don't offer any technical details on this technology for tech geeks like us, and they don't even have a demo of the improvements on their website. No offence, but right from the very start the whole NIPS thing sounded like a gimmick. So, we just had to test it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We set out to test the technology by shooting a dimly lit scene (right after sunset in a north facing room). We used the Nokia 5220, as well as a Nokia 6500 classic, which was available at the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you will see, Nokia 6500 classic images have extremely high levels of noise because the camera automatically boosts ISO to make up for the low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 on the other hand preferred to keep ISO levels relatively down, deploying at the same time some new noise suppression routine. The result is much better low light pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a drawback to keeping the ISO down of course and that's the resulting low shutter speed. In our case, we got all the 10 test Nokia 6500 classic shots nice and sharp (but with a lot of noise), while all the Nokia 5220 images were a bit blurry - even this one that we are displaying is not tack sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But from where we stand, the high noise has already ruined the images by the 6500c, so we guess the Nokia 5220 and its NIPS technology is the better choice - as long as you keep your hands and your subjects still.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video is only good for MMS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5220 camera captures only QCIF resolution video in 3GP format. While they can be unlimited in length, their quality and resolution is only good for an occasional MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There's stereo Bluetooth, but no 3G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is at about the level you would expect in this price range. Nokia 5220 XpressMusic has support for GPRS and EDGE to get wireless data transfers covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 2.0 is also on board for wireless short range connections. There is support for the A2DP profile, so you can listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB connectivity is really seamless. Thanks to the standard microUSB port and the supplied USB cable, connecting to a computer is hassle-free. Once connected, the phone memory contents as well as those of the memory card can be access on the computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a microSD memory card slot, which can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring information, is also present here. Though officially quoted to support up to 2GB cards, 8GB cards are no trouble at all for the Nokia 5220.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Nokia 5310, the memory card slot is not hidden under the battery, so you can hot-swap it problem-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers galore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 classic has an integrated browser, which which is identical to the one used in Nokia 5310.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser faces serious competition from another application - the well-known Opera Mini, which serves as an excuse for Nokia to not bother developing their own S40 web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mini is pre-installed on all recent midrange S40 phones and is definitely our first choice for browsing the web on Nokia 5220. It is far more intuitive and fits text better than the integrated browser. The browsing experience can hardly be compared to the one on Nokia's smartphones but still is at a more than decent level. We still wished the screen was a little bigger on this occasion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is one of Nokia's elements<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer brings no novelties either, and, frankly, it doesn't need many. Month, week, and day views are available for the calendar. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are five types of events: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Further, each type of event has its own specific fields like start and end time, type of alert with various advance intervals, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handy to-do manager that enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. They are easily synced with the calendar application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are available as well - their length is limited to 3000 characters. The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute length limit, stopwatch, countdown timer and a calculator. They are all easily operable and decently looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time the calculator comes in two flavors - a simple one with the most basic functions and a scientific one, which is more advanced but rather uncomfortable to use. In addition a loan calculator is also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There's a full application suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 comes with a good number of preinstalled applications. The only thing missing really is the office document viewer that can be found on every midrange Samsung and LG handset nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The consistently useful unit convertor is first in the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application is a built-in Yahoo! Search piece of software. After setting the country or region you can conduct web search for images and other information. The 20 most relevant search results are returned to your phone upon request. Find out more about the Search at nokia.com</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Sensor application is a Bluetooth-based tool for detecting other users in the vicinity and sharing information with them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Download! application follows, which directly connects to the Nokia download center, where you can find a lot of downloadable content for you phone, most of it free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, there's the Wallpaper creator, which challenges your imagination to create nice wallpapers for the mobile. Seemed fun at first but on a second thought, we doubt it this one will be put to very frequent use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia WidSets are mini applications, which bring favorite web content to your mobile phone for free. The Java based service is offered by Widsets.com and it can work on every regular Java phone as well. Among the most popular widgets are the mobile versions of YouTube, Flickr, Ebay, Wikipedia, IMDb, and various weather forecast and news services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final featured application is World clock for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Say hello to Nokia Maps for S40<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps is becoming a familiar sight on recent S40 devices and the Nokia 5220 XpressMusic is among the handsets to feature it. Among the things you can do without a GPS receiver is browse maps, look up addresses and locations, and plan routes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps offers straightforward route planning. Having entered a start point and a destination, the application will plan your route with easy-to-follow directions to where you're heading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting down some Landmarks while you're on the go, or saving locations in the Favorites section is another available option. Favorites contents can also be exported/sent via MMS, which is a nice extra too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having Nokia Maps on your mobile phone is a nice advantage. Of course you can always get the competing Java-based Google Maps but Nokia Maps has one crucial advantage - you can preload your maps on the memory card so that you don't need to download them over the air.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pair Nokia Maps with an external Bluetooth GPS receiver you can also enjoy real time voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation. It comes at a certain price, but it's always there as an option for those who need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't have an external GPS unit, in some cases Google Maps may be the better choice. For one, it's up and going much faster (Nokia Maps takes couple of minutes to load on 5220), and then there's the convenient Locate Me feature that approximates your location on the map based on cellular triangulation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let the games begin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled gaming package on Nokia 5220 includes four games. The City Bloxx game is first in this list. It is a challenge to both brain and reflexes and, as you might know, our team is quite fond of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next in line is the Snake III, which hardly needs description. After all it's the trademark game of Nokia handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Guitar Rock Tour, which was first seen on the Symbian-powered Nokia 5320 XpressMusic. It's inspired by the popular Guitar Hero game, except here you play the guitar using the keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last game is Rally 3D. It has excellent graphics and is really rather amusing to play.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To conclude, Nokia 5220 is a solid performer - it provides pretty much everything as promised in a neat and compact package. Simplicity, affordability and friendly handling are good enough grounds for the likely mass appeal of Nokia 5220 XpressMusic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5220 doesn't have 3G support or a fancy camera, but if it's music you are after you're right on target. We are yet to see however how an exciting rivalry will unfold. The recently released and promising Samsung 3510 Beat b is staking much on shake control and might be a worthy challenger if the pricing is right. So, whether Nokia 5220 will beat or get beat is a tough bet to take.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still guess many of you will be choosing between the Nokia 5220 and Nokia 5310. So, we sat down and ran a quick comparison. It turned out Nokia 5220 outperforms the mighty bestseller. We found that Nokia 5220 has a number of advantages:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the only things that put the 5310 ahead of the 5220 are the slightly better display, Visual Radio (not that big a deal) and, finally, the excellent build and more solid construction. The Nokia 5220 seems way too plasticky and the finish is not as refined as the one of 5310 - but all that's a matter of personal taste. So, if you're choosing an XpressMusic handset, the Nokia 5220 seems well worth it and the eccentric styling makes sure it won't go unnoticed.</paragraph>
