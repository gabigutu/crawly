			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This has been going on for a while now but, as both makers are keener than ever to outdo each other in the race to the Android top, their flagships are only getting more and more alike. The biggest difference is now in the timing, which is also part of the game - and that's what's made it actually more interesting to watch. The two rival Korean flagships are travelling in different orbits - only to meet on one's way down and another's way up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back when it launched, the LG G2 was the embodiment of LG's determination to better the Samsung Galaxy S4 in every way possible. The HTC One and the Sony Xperia Z were reduced to collateral damage - the eyes of the LG G2 set on the main target alone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fast-forward a few quarters, and the G2 is on its way ... out. We wouldn't say down unless it's down in history as one of the best things to come out of LG's handheld labs for quite a while. And it sure is going to try and cash in one last time, especially now that it's still in perfectly good shape and the new crop of flagships are charging big buck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the way in, or up, or whatever you think fits, the Galaxy S5 has leapt ahead of its predecessor with water resistance, a superior camera, slightly bigger screen, a fingerprint scanner, beefier battery, the new Snapdragon 801 chipset and 4K video recording among other things. That means the LG G2 is, at least in some departments, lagging behind as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G2 over Samsung Galaxy S5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 has the advantage of time. The tables have turned and it's now the LG flagship's turn to be outsmarted. Without being a dramatic step forward, the chipset is a tad faster than the older generation. The camera is a serious improvement though, with a much bigger sensor, higher resolution, the world's first phase-detect autofocus in a smartphone and the stellar 2160p video recording. The microSD card is consistently a point in Samsung's favor and water resistance is a nice touch. The heart rate monitor may not be appreciated by everyone but the latest TouchWiz UI has received a fresh coat of paint under Android KitKat, while keeping the impressive feature set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One would think that such a long list of pros spells a walkover for the Galaxy S5 but we wouldn't be so sure. LG's creative design and excellent ergonomics are still an important asset against an opponent whose styling is a major source of controversy. The G2 is slightly thicker but only just - and it's got a bigger screen to show for it. The impressively slim bezels secure the G2's lead in terms of screen per surface ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G2 is a solid cameraphone too and one of the few to offer optical image stabilization. We'll be testing how well the digital variety compares to OIS in our camera comparison. Then there's the higher battery capacity, which will also be put to the test now that both contenders are running KitKat. Ultimately though, the G2's biggest advantage comes down to money. The flagship has been out for a while and goes for half the S5's price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there's more to flagship phones than just numbers and specs. How we choose a phone is a combination of things, some of which impossible to put a price on. Sometimes we'll do the math, and if we're lucky there's chemistry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But luck will have nothing to do with anything when you're choosing between Samsung's and LG's - which for some stands for the best in Android. Tough call - but that's how we like them. Let's get started, shall we.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 carries on in the footsteps of its predecessors and aims to improve instead of change. The physical home button is pretty much set in stone (Samsung is doing it in tablets too), the capacitive button that used to launch the context menu now handles recent apps. Other than that, nothing has dramatically changed. The screen is only just bigger at 5.1" (up from 5 inches sharp) but the new water resistant design has required the tight-seal flap over the microUSB port. The Galaxy S5 has also swapped the hyperglaze finish for what looks and feels like leather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2, on the other hand, had at the time of its launch the sole purpose of outclassing the Galaxy S4 in every way possible. With an almost bezel-free front, it still holds the best screen-to-surface ratio in the industry and the rear-placed physical buttons allowed an impressively clean, minimalist design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Size-wise we're looking at 142 x 72.5 x 8.1mm for the Galaxy S5 and 138.5 x 70.9 x 8.9mm for the LG G2. The two contenders are almost identical in weight, tipping the scales at 145 g and 143 g respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 fits a bigger 5.2" display in its narrower and shorter body. Some outstanding use of space has allowed LG to fit the same number of sensors above the screen. There's a front-facing camera, proximity and ambient light sensors next to the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works the other way around below the screen, where Samsung had to accommodate a physical Home button and a couple of capacitive keys, while the LG G2 has its controls on-screen. The side bezels are clearly a lot slimmer on the G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Samsung flagship has in its favor is overall thickness - 8.1mm as opposed to the G2's 8.9mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the G2 was meant as a response to last season's Galaxy S4 the finish used is obviously LG's take on Samsung's hyperglaze. The S5 is a different story altogether - in terms of both styling and usability. The perforated leather-like finish is perhaps the least important part of the equation - although it certainly allows a much better grip. We do think it's a notable improvement over the glossy plastic of the S4 but everyone is free to disagree - and dislike the faux leather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What counts is the removable battery cover - over LG's lack of power options and memory expansion. Even with a card slot and removable battery, the Galaxy S5 has an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, which is one of the important upgrades over the Galaxy S4. And one the LG G2 just couldn't have anticipated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back, the camera lenses are almost identically placed at the top but the camera module on the Samsung creates a prominent bulge. What's tangibly raised on the LG G2 is the power button, squeezed between the volume keys. The entire setup is comfortably placed right under the user's index finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones use a single LED flash but the Galaxy S5 adds a heart-rate sensor on the back, just below the 16MP camera lens. The Galaxy S5's speaker grille is in the lower left corner at the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, the Galaxy S5 features a microphone and the microUSB 3.0 port under a protective flap, which the phone will prompt you to close every time you unplug a cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker of the LG G2 is located at the bottom - there's a matching grille on the other side of the microUSB port for the microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is at the bottom on the LG G2 and at the top on the Samsung Galaxy S5. The former is perhaps more comfortable for connecting a headset with the phone placed on a table, while the latter is more pocket-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flat sides of the Samsung Galaxy S5 contribute to the more angular look and feel of the device. The LG G2 is more curved with rounded corners, but that hardly makes a difference for the actual handling. Not at this screen size anyway. In fact, the glossy finish has resulted in a somewhat compromised grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Funny how two plastic devices are so different in terms of finish and actual feel in hand. The curvy and glossy LG G2 handles almost like a piece of glass, gliding in - and hopefully not out of - your hand. The feel of leather is quite convincing in the Galaxy S5 and - the aesthetic qualities aside - it does allow a more precise and secure hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The LG smartphone was able to outdo Samsung's last attempt but repeating that feat would've been quite a surprise really. This one isn't decided by looks and build quality - both phones are very well made and handling quite comfortably. LG's insanely slim bezels and the rear buttons are great points in favor but the Galaxy S5 is just much better than the predecessor. Even if the G2's non-expandable memory isn't a deal-breaker, LG has nothing against Samsung's water-resistance and fingerprint scanner. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with a 5.1" 1920 x 1080 display of the Super AMOLED variety with a pixel density of around 432ppi. The LG G2 has a 5.2" True HD-IPS+ LCD panel of the same 1920 x 1080 resolution, which breaks down to around 424ppi. The numbers are pretty close, and each technology has its advantages - and downsides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we get deep into the details, the difference in size is probably of little relevance here. 0.1" inch is insignificant and the on-screen buttons mean a portion of the LG G2's screen is unused, except in the video player, where all the screen estate is available. Double-tap-to-wake is a nice little trick we like in the LG G2 though. And those slim bezels of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cross-hatch pattern that gave AMOLED screens a bad name is no longer an issue at these resolution levels but the perceived sharpness is inevitably affected - again not something that's visible to the naked eye. The Super AMOLED screen on the Galaxy S5 is the PenTile variety, with subpixels arranged in a diamond pattern. What this means is each individual pixel isn't made of a standard red, green and blue pixel like in LCD screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The differences are mostly visible under the microscope. The LG G2's standard RGB matrix has an equal amount of equally-sized red, green and blue pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The displays under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A redesigned panel gives the Galaxy S5 a number of important improvements over last year's model: higher brightness and more efficient backlighting, as well as lower reflectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED already offers much punchier colors, the deepest blacks and practically infinite contrast but for those who prefer true colors can have it their way too. Several screen modes allow users to calibrate the screen saturation to their liking, with Cinema mode as close to standard RGB as a smartphone can get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the numbers. The blacks of the Galaxy S5 are unmatchable by an LCD although the LG G2's blacks look pretty impressive at up to 50% brightness. The LCD panel on the LG G2 is inherently the brighter of the two. Contrast-wise, the AMOLED wins although the LG flagship posts some impressive numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When things get cranked up to 100% brightness the G2 struggles with the blacks and loses some of its contrast ratio. In the opposite corner, the Galaxy S5 fails to match the LCD maximum brightness but is probably the brightest Super AMOLED to date - without compromising the blacks and, therefore, contrast ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for outdoor visibility, Super AMOLEDs are clearly superior in bright sunlight as they offer one glass layer less. The Galaxy S5 gets a score that's up there with the best we've tested. On the other hand, the LG G2 has a more reflective screen that loses contrast in the sun.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The Galaxy S5 has the smaller screen but makes up for it handsomely in terms of performance - less reflectivity, higher contrast, better color reproduction.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moving on to battery performance, the Galaxy S5 comes with a bigger 2800mAh battery compared to its predecessor but still doesn't match the LG G2's 3000mAh unit. But to make the most out of the battery capacity, most devices rely on software too - both phones have power saving modes, which we disabled for these tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're using numbers from our latest battery test of the LG G2, after the KitKat update, which managed to notably improve the battery performance. The only test where it failed to outdo Jelly Bean was video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the numbers. Some great scores for both sides in the calling but the LG G2 is almost 4 hours clear at the top.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Things are closer in web browsing but the LG G2 is still 2 hours ahead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And finally a victory for the Galaxy S5 - it managed 11 hours of continuous video playback while the G2 did 9 and a half.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before the KitKat update, the LG G2 was let down by stand-by time for an overall rating of 62 hours - that's the time between charges if you do an hour of calling, browsing and video playback a day. With KitKat, the LG G2 managed a much better stand-by time for a great score of 81 hours, which secures it a comfortable win.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Galaxy S5 and LG's G2 are both running the latest Android KitKat 4.4.2, heavily skinned of course with the feature rich and deeply-revamped TouchWiz and Optimus UI, each with their own typography, icons, wallpapers, settings, special features and just about everything that sets them apart from stock Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz lockscreen on the Galaxy S5 has gotten rid of the multiple widget panes but comes secured with the fingerprint scanner, integrated in the home button. There's a camera shortcut of course and a number of unlock effects to choose from. The homescreen is not the only thing you can fingerprint-secure - you can do files and photos too in the so-called Private mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KitKat update brings no changes to the lockscreen on the LG G2, featuring the optional five customizable app shortcuts. The KnockON feature lets you unlock the device by a double tap and that works the other way around too - a double tap on a blank spot of the homescreen or the status bar will lock the device back. Pattern unlock is supported and a custom combination will unlock the phone in Guest Mode, allowing limited access to features and content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreens are pretty similar in terms of layout and behavior. On the Samsung Galaxy S5, the biggest novelty is the My Magazine homescreen pane that serves social network updates and news and features, powered by Flipboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's Optimus UI lets you customize the on-screen controls. You can choose between several layout options and even set a transparent background. An extra key can be added for the Quick Memo feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently the G2 comes with two themes - the default one and another one, called Marshmallow. The latter is more likely to be used by kids than any adult. You can download more themes from LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a set of different icons to choose from and you can even make custom ones. You can also change their size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area of the Galaxy S5 has seen a redesign, which features a new color palette and flatter, rounded icons. The toggles work as usual and below them are two buttons (S Finder and Quick connect) and below that is the brightness slider, which can be hidden to save space, but you're stuck with the two buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's notification area is like a congestion on a public road - there are swipeable toggles at the top, followed a list of QSlide apps, then the brightness toggle and the volume toggle, leaving what room is left at the bottom for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The toggles can naturally be rearranged and enabled or disabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung app drawer displays icons in a 5 x 4 grid and you can list apps in a custom way (however you like), alphabetically or just see downloaded. You can uninstall and hide apps in the app drawer from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's more of the same with LG's app drawer. The grid is the same and you can hide or uninstall apps. You can also view apps by a custom, alphabetical or downloaded order and can uninstall or disable apps. But you can also change the app drawer wallpaper. Finally you have the option of viewing small or large icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dedicated capacitive button on the Galaxy S5 that will take you into the task switcher. From there you can swipe to close apps, close all at once or go to the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pretty much the same can be said about the LG G2 except that it has to use the on-screen home button to pull the recent apps screen. And while you can rearrange and change the virtual on-screen buttons on the G2, there's no order that has the recent apps button as an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a task manager on the G2 that's accessed through the task switcher interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for some exclusive apps by both manufacturers that aid multitasking or viewing content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 comes with the Multi-window multitasking feature, which allows you to run two apps side by side. You can copy text across apps or snap a screenshot of one app and paste it in the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a pair of apps works well together (e.g. the browser and the email client) you can create a shortcut that launches both. Note that only select apps work with Multi-window but more can be found in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no floating apps here, but there's something called Toolbox - a floating icon that shows a list of shortcuts. This is a quick way to get to some of the most commonly used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leftmost pane of the Galaxy S5 homescreen features My Magazine that displays both news articles and social networking updates. This is powered by Flipboard and you can enjoy your reads in a clean interface and send links to your friends or post social updates straight from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On LG's side there's Slide Aside UI and Q-Slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Slide Aside you can use a three-finger swipe from the right side of the screen to add the app into the Slide Aside UI, while three finger swipes from the left will switch between the running apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Slide Aside supports up to three apps which get into a sort of frozen state and you can access a preview of all the three apps either form the notification area's dedicated shortcut or via a three-finger swipe to the left on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Q Slide option makes it possible for you to use widget-like resizable small apps while using other full-screen apps. The system-wide Quick Memo integration allows you to take a screenshot anywhere in the phone and take notes over it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for some security features. Private mode on the Galaxy S5 secures photos and other files with your fingerprint (any of the three prints set up, with the password as a failsafe). Those files are only accessible when Private mode is enabled and completely hidden from apps otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint scanner has been certified by PayPal and can be used by apps to secure transactions, unlike the iPhone's sensor, which cannot be accessed by third-party apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has the so-called Guest Mode. It's activated by a specific unlock pattern. There is no app drawer in guest mode - you can access up to five apps in there - camera, video and music players, calculator and quick remote. You can, of course, make more apps available. If you want to exit guest mode and go back to using the phone normally, lock the screen and unlock it with your standard unlock pattern, not the guest one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Knock code we saw in the LG G Pro 2 has made its way to the LG G2 with the updated Optimus UI that goes with the KitKat release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Galaxy S5 and the LG G2 come with Google Now preinstalled but Samsung also adds its S Voice assistant, whereas the LG G2 has seen its Voice Mate (a.k.a. Q Voice) feature removed with the KitKat update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice lets you do various things via voice commands: dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo, set a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many other features on both phones we just don't cover in this head-to-head but you can read about in the dedicated reviews. Both devices will launch relevant apps when you connect, say, the microUSB cable or the headphones. Both can re-size the UI down to a third of the screen for comfortable singe-handed use. Both have an IR emitter and relevant apps to remotely control home appliances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're looking for the simple, unskinned Android experience you might be better off with HTC's or Sony's implementation or, better yet, pure Android on the Nexus line. Custom ROMs like CyanogenMod are an option too. However, if you're in the market for an all-you-can-eat selection of features (some of which exclusive), Samsung's TouchWiz and LG's Optimus UI are your best bet. Both phones are chockfull of apps, features and customization options, yet impressively fast and fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. LG had an answer to the multitasking prowess of TouchWiz in the Galaxy S4, and even to the Smart Stay (Smart Screen) and Smart Pause (Smart Video). It's things like the homescreen modes (Car, Kids, Private and Easy) that give the Samsung Galaxy S5 a bit of an edge. The fingerprint security that extends beyond the lockscreen and the heart-rate monitor pairing with the S Health app solidify its lead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with a better chipset in the face of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801. It's the same four Krait 400 cores and Adreno 330 GPU as in the Snapdragon 800, which powers the LG G2, but both are clocked higher to make 801 MSM8974AC the most powerful Snapdragon chip currently in use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG flagship has four cores clocked at 2.26 GHz and an Adreno 330 GPU that goes as high as 450 MHz per core. The RAM handling tops at 1600 MHz for the 2 GB preinstalled. The Galaxy S5 has four Krait 400 cores at 2.5 GHz each and GPU cores with up to 578 MHz with RAM using up to 1866 MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What these numbers indicate is a theoretical speed bump in the Galaxy S5. Hardware aside, there are software optimizations too that can further increase the lead. But enough introduction, let's look at the numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>UPDATE: We re-tested the LG G2 since its KitKat update to see how the device handles benchmarks. We did the same for the battery score, which can be seen on page 3 of this review. But to further clarify the difference we will add the Jelly Bean G2 scores alongside the KitKat's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi and Linpack focus on CPU performance. BenchmarkPi gauges the performance of each individual core while Linpack tests multi-threaded performance. In each benchmark the Galaxy S5 scored better than the LG G2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3, AnTuTu 4 and Quadrant test everything about the hardware rig, from CPU to graphics to read/write performance. All three benchmarks show the Galaxy S5 a clear winner, by some distance, again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next comes graphic performance where the Galaxy S5 should have an edge and it shows. The off-screen GFXBench tests (those that squeeze the raw potential of the GPU when it doesn't need to push its native pixels) put the Adreno 300 in the Galaxy S5 on top.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Set at high quality in Epic Citadel, the LG G2 was able to claim its first win by 4 frames per second.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark X is Rightware's gaming benchmark that tests graphics and CPU performance, while Basemark OS II tests just about every facet of your phone's performance. It's exactly here that manufacturers used to heavily cheat, so we ran an anti-cheat version that should've kept any trickery out. In honesty, none of the contenders attempted any and the results saw the Galaxy S5 as the clear winner in both tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we come to browsing performance. We're using two renowned benchmarks for this purpose. SunSpider is focused on JavaScript performance while BrowserMark II looks at the HTML 5 performance. The winner, again, is undisputed and it is the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider 1.0.2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. So in terms of performance newer is better, and that's hardly a revelation. The Snapdragon 801 proved its superiority over the Snapdragon 800 but, looking at the scores, we can't really say the difference is dramatic. The Galaxy S5 was able to secure wins on just about every test we performed by just enough to call it comfortable but when actually using both devices side by side, we wouldn't call the loser a slouch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you're buying a flagship these days you're expecting great multimedia capabilities regardless of the platform. It's gotten to the point when people don't really look to close at what a smartphone offers in terms of gallery, video and music players or connectivity options, because we've got used to getting the best there is, at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To each its own, though - Samsung and LG have their little touches here and there which will outline the differences in the multimedia handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So without further ado.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 gallery is a grid of thumbnails, which can be resized by a pinch zoom. You can sort using the usual filters: recent, events, albums, etc. Once you're in an album view you can always invoke the side bar with the other albums by performing an edge swipe, which is very convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's gallery also stacks photos in resizeable thumbnails and offers the usual filtering options. Once inside an album you can't go back to the view with all your albums with a swipe like in TouchWiz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 and Galaxy S5 offer batch operations for sharing, deleting or rotating images. Both have their separate editing options or you can use Google's excellent Photos editing software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally both galleries support full-resolution images as well as panoramas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are capable file managers provided on both the Galaxy S5 and the LG G2. They have pretty similar interfaces. Samsung's My Files app lists your files by category (Images, Videos, Audio, etc.) and has a recently viewed section. There's also a download history and Dropbox integration as well. LG's is pretty much identical save for the Recent files folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app on the Galaxy S5 adds the ability to scan for an FTP server or search nearby devices that have wireless sharing on, features missing on LG's side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The Galaxy S5 has a slightly more intuitive way of going through albums that the LG G2 lacks. The better file manager is an added bonus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung music player has been aligned with the new, flat, minimalist look of KitKat on the Galaxy S5. The refreshed interface aside, the Galaxy S5's music player has retained its excellent functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music square is a standout feature of the music player - the phone will scan your music library rating each track in terms of tempo (Exciting or Calm) and emotion (Passionate or Joyful). It can then load a playlist matching your chosen tempo and mood. The emotion axis in the graph can be switched to Age, which makes it easy to automatically create a playlist of classics or contemporary hits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SoundAlive equalizer presets are cleverly organized into a square similar to the Music Square. The presets balance Treble and Bass, Vocals and Instrumental. You can also just tap the Auto toggle or enable a Tube amp effect, 7.1 channel virtualization, along with Studio, Club and Concert Hall effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adapt Sound tests the performance of your earphones and tunes the equalizer based on the readings to provide you the ultimate listening experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's music player allows you to check online for information on the artist, album or track you're listening to, straight off the now playing screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also comes with its own equalizer with predefined settings or you can choose to set it up yourself. It lacks Samsung's smart features like Adapt Sound, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise you get the same great functionality. The LG music player won't act like there's no other music aside from playlists and albums and will respect your folders, just like the TouchWiz player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has a built-in FM Radio with RDS. The Galaxy S5 lacks the feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The Galaxy S5 has some advanced features like Adapt Sound. The LG G2 offers an FM Radio.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The video player hasn't changed in the way it displays your video files. There's a thumb view of all your videos in a vertically-scrollable list. Videos also run in the background while you're browsing the list like on previous Galaxy devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a great chapter view that segments a video into chapters for faster navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's video player also revolves around a vertical grid of video thumbnails. Videos you've already watched will have a little icon indicating you've seen them and you can pick up where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the Samsung Galaxy S5 you can pop a video out of the video player and have it overlay the homescreen or any other screen, using Pop Up Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same thing can be done on the LG G2 using Q Slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to actual codec support the Galaxy S5 falls miserably short of the LG G2's impeccable resume. Every file played on the G2 while the Galaxy S5 has issues with even regular files like DivX or MKV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. You may prefer the Galaxy S5's video player interface but the LG G2 gains points where it counts - playing actual videos better. The bigger screen is also a point in the G2's favor - the on-screen buttons move conveniently out of the way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera and video specs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera department is probably the one where the Samsung flagship has the most advantage over its rival. The Samsung Galaxy S5 brings an improved camera sensor to the table. First off, it comes with a 16MP sensor all the while retaining the the same 1.12 µm pixel size. This has been achieved by incorporating a larger 1/2.6" size sensor as opposed to the 1/3.06" of the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Secondly, the new sensor has an aspect ratio of 16:9 and thus takes images in the screen's native aspect ratio. Not only the camera live viewfinder but also the photos match the screen better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 also comes with the first ever implementation of phase-detection auto focus in a smartphone, which is said to focus in just 0.3 seconds - that's a great speed for any point and shoot camera, let alone a cameraphone. The LG G2 can't cope well with that as its auto focus is slower than the average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 also has a wider f/2.2 aperture compared to the f/2.4 of the LG G2. This in theory should allow the sensor to capture more light, thus allowing for a faster shutter speed in low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 also premiers Samsung's ISOCELL sensor. With ISOCELL individual pixels are located in actual cells. Barriers between the pixel cells reduce the crosstalk between them by 30%, which reduces noise in low-light conditions. An added advantage of the cells is that they improve on the back-side illumination by growing each pixel's light-collecting capacity by 30%, which enhances the dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only area where the LG's flagship has an advantage is the optical image stabilization, which lacks on the Galaxy S5. The advantage of OIS, aside from being hardware-enabled and probably better performing (we test OIS vs DIS in the video quality section), is that it's always on and doesn't take away from the field of view like digital image and video stabilization would. Another advantage of OIS is that it can allow for slower shutter speeds where without it camera shake may become too pronounced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording is also in favor of the Samsung device here. It matches the 30 fps and 60 fps 1080p shooting of the LG G2 but brings a much better UHD (4K or 2160p) recording at 30 frames per second. The LG G2 also benefits from OIS here and as we said we'll be testing what effect it has a little further on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the Galaxy S5's camera app has been redesigned to match the minimalist philosophy behind the new TouchWiz. The core layout hasn't been touched but the result looks better than before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a unified camera and camcorder UI with two virtual shutter buttons. There's a column of shortcuts on the left, the middle two of which are customizable. All settings are collected into a grid of shortcuts so you can access everything easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mode option is a scrollable list at the bottom. Several options have been combined into Shot &amp; more - Best photo, Best face, Drama shot, Eraser and Panning shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new mode is Virtual tour shot, which is similar to panoramas except you can move forward, turn left or right, and move some more. The result is an animation of your camera movement, the phone will even draw a map with your path. Interestingly, additional camera modes can be downloaded, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pretty similarly, on the LG G2's camera interface you get a bar on the right with the still/video toggle, a virtual shutter key and gallery shortcut on the right and a column with four shortcuts on the left. You'll need to toggle between the camera and camcorder interface by swiping the virtual lever. Each view gives you the relevant options and modes and you get a 4:3 viewfinder in camera and 16:9 viewfinder in camcorder mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick between one of twelve shooting modes - Normal, Shot and Clear (erases something from a picture), HDR, Panorama, VR Panorama (Photo Sphere shot), Beauty shot, Dual camera shot, Night scene, Sports, Time Catch shot and Intelligent Auto mode, which automatically selects the right scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selective focus gives you the ability to choose where the focus in a shot will lie. It takes two shots and processes them so you can photograph a close-up subject and blur the background or blur the object and keep the background in focus. The third option is everything in focus, here's how those options look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processing isn't perfect, but the upside is that this mode is very quick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The Galaxy S5 brings a world's first in cameraphone autofocus tech, a new ISOCELL sensor, along with higher resolution without sacrificing pixel size. While optical image stabilization is a big bonus to have, UHD video is bigger as it brings twice the resolution of FHD.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now that we've gotten the technical details out of the way it's time to take a look at the provided quality of stills. For the purpose we've prepared a number of 100% resolution crops taken from both cameras images. No further processing has been applied so that we can see how these two cameras perform in real life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good light</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In daylight the Samsung Galaxy S5 has the clear advantage in resolved detail. The ISOCELL technology promises to let in more light per pixel which should translate into less noise and hence better detail resolving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G2 exposes shadowed areas of the scene a little better but that doesn't mean it delivers more detail. There's quite a bit of noise in those darker regions. The G2 images are also a little softer but given the Galaxy S5's overeager sharpening we don't see this as a bad thing - the G2 offers sharp images, just less so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up we can see how both cameras handle detail that's further away from the lens. In unfavorable lighting conditions both devices struggle to capture any detail in the shadows. Still the Galaxy S5 has a slight advantage and a little more detail (see the crop on the left).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors on the Galaxy S5 are a little warmer, while the G2 loses some contrast, which results in slightly washed out colors. While the Galaxy S5 offers a little more detail overall, its oversharpened look ads for an impression for a wider gap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have a go at the full-resolution images of both devices below. These are the 16:9 16 MP Galaxy S5 samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the 4:3 LG G2 photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 was able to take advantage of its more advanced hardware to best the good LG G2 in favorable light conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>High Dynamic Range</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to high dynamic range imagery where in order to capture equally well exposed photos the two cameras capture a sequence of three shots - an underexposed, and overexposed and a normal image and then combine them into a single shot. The advantage of this HDR mode is that the cameras are able to capture much more of the extremely dark and bright areas of a particular scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both cameras have a specific mode for shooting HDR - it's called RichTone for the Galaxy S5 and Dynamic Tone for the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off let's take a look at what HDR brings to the Galaxy S5 samples. In the crop below you'll see a normal sample on the left and an HDR sample on the right - note that both samples are from the Galaxy S5, the LG G2 follows in the next crop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 offers a pretty good dynamic range in its images. The upper crop showing the building with the sky and mountain in the background is almost entirely the same, detail and exposure-wise. The HDR sample has lightened up the foreground and background a little but since this part of the image has been well exposed in the normal shot, the difference isn't dramatic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The crop on the lower right and left part shows a portion of the scene that wasn't exposed well in the normal shot. Here the HDR mode brings back much more detail and has done a very good job of exposing the overall scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the full HDR sample with the non-HDR sample alongside it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the LG G2 - it provides a better overall exposed image to begin with - note that the darker part of the scene is still lighter than on the Galaxy S5's normal shot. But HDR does add a little more exposure to the scene and brings some additional detail to the clouds in the upper crop. The images of the LG G2 once again look softer, but they're not soft. It's just that Galaxy S5 tendency to oversharpen things we mentioned earlier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's pretty close but the LG G2 manages to squeeze more light out of the image - without HDR. With HDR it manages to bring exposure to the darker parts and do its job perfectly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full-resolution samples if you want to check for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Low light</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Low light is an area where the Galaxy S5 should have the advantage thanks to the ISOCELL and wider f/2.2 aperture. We shot one normal sample without flash and one with flash. Watch out for the skin tones in the flash sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jumping straight into the results - the Galaxy S5 looks to have a little more detail into its normal shot. The difference isn't that great, though, and thanks to the oversharpening you can see the edges of the subject become rigid, whereas the G2 handles them better. The latter goes for colder tones while the Galaxy S5 uses more natural-looking, warmer colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When using the flash, the coldness of the G2 gets accentuated but the detail levels jump a notch thanks to the LED. The Galaxy S5 also manages to squeeze more detail into the subject and the rigidness of the edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is a little softer which looks to be because of some aggressive noise reduction. The Samsung Galaxy S5 carries some more noise but also more detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see the difference between the normal and flash-on image of the Galaxy S5 below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the LG G2 samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was a pretty close one but the Galaxy S5 was able to capture a little more detail. The LG G2 has one of the slowest focusing times in low light we've seen on a phone while the Galaxy S5 retains its fast focus even in low light. This will provide you with more, in-focus shots with the Galaxy smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is an excellent camcorder and easily beats LG's flagship here. As you can see in the 100% crop we've made below the level of detail in both 1080p@30 fps and 60 fps on the Galaxy S5 is clearly superior. The addition of UHD recording at 30 fps bumps up the resolution and also detail more than twice, making the quality gap even wider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The optical image stabilization of the LG G2 could potentially bring back some of the lost ground but as we've seen with devices like the iPhone 5s sometimes digital stabilization can be just as good as optical one. In the video below you can clearly see how the two phones perform. While the Galaxy S5 offers really good software stabilization the LG G2 has the advantage with cleaner, smoother movement. There's also the added bonus of a wider field of view - with digital stabilization the sensor crops some of the frame in order to stabilize.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with still imaging the LG G2 chooses to go for a much more balanced exposure, whereas the Galaxy S5 leaves the sky darker in comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fine detail on the Galaxy S5 videos is superior - you can read the signs and view textures better. Looking at the fences in the scene, the Galaxy S5 tries to display them and succeeds while the LG G2 struggles to make them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5's 1080p@30 fps videos carry a bitrate of around 17 Mbps with 2 channel (stereo) audio recording with a bitrate of 123 Kbps and a 48 kHz sampling rate. FullHD videos at 60 fps carry a bitrate of 26 Mbps with 59 frames per second, an audio bitrate of 119 Kbps with two channels and a sampling rate of 48 kHz. Ultra High Definition videos (4K or 2160p) have a much higher 46 Mbps bitrate, 29 frames per second, an audio bitrate of 120 Kbps with stereo recording at 48 kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2's standard FullHD 30 fps videos have the same bitrate of around 17 Mbps with a solid framerate of 30. Audio bitrate stands higher compared to the Samsung at 145 Kbps with two channels (stereo) with a sampling rate of 48 kHz. While carrying lower detail the smooth FullHD 60fps videos have a higher bitrate of almost 30 Mbps and a solid framerate of 58 fps. Audio is sampled in the 48 kHz with stereo channels but with a higher bitrate of 157 Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the LG G2 has the same bitrate in 1080p@30 fps and higher in 1080p@60 fps recording and carries a higher audio recording bitrate. However the G2 lacks the incredibly-detailed UHD video capture mode and even with the advantage in bitrate it doesn't offer better-detailed videos.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Honestly, a walkover for the Galaxy S5, but anything different would've been a massive surprise. Scratch that - a letdown. The gap between release dates has seen these two flagships on either end of a seesaw - and it's LG's turn to touch the floor. Nothing out of the ordinary and... well... they'll be the first to bounce back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not to say that the G3 - if LG keep on counting up - will kick the Galaxy S5's butt but we'd like to see it try. Delighted if it succeeds. In many ways though, the Galaxy S5 does to the Galaxy S4 exactly what the LG G2 already did - and then some. No wonder then, LG are on the list of casualties this time too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The improved AMOLED panel, latest Snapdragon 801, waterproofing, the fingerprint scanner, bigger camera sensor and 4K videos. Everyone's free to not even count the heart-rate monitor and the updated TouchWiz (the Homescreen modes and the option to fingerprint-secure content are great).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And hey, this is nothing like a few years ago when hardware was booming and each year brought upgrades we thought impossible the year before. The improvements are becoming subtler and new additions are easily dismissed as gimmicks - until manufacturers really try hard to make them count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even on the exterior design front, we haven't been wowed in a while - what most makers do is improve and refine rather than invent. The rear buttons of the LG G2 are probably the closest to real innovation we can think of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, regardless of how you feel about faux leather, the Galaxy S5 had no problem winning the design battle. And that has nothing to do with aesthetics. The accessible battery and expandable memory in a waterproof body were enough against a handset with a sealed battery and no memory card slot. And that's not even counting the fingerprint scanner, which has its uses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From then on, we can hardly blame the LG G2 for failing to respond to the upgrades and improvements of the more recent Galaxy S5. The new AMOLED display proved superior in terms of color reproduction, contrast and outdoor performance. To be fair, it looks like any screen will have trouble matching the outstanding quality of AMOLED in the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest TouchWiz got the better of Optimus UI but the latter will likely see another upgrade before gracing the next LG flagship. The camera department was another straightforward win for the Samsung - a bigger and higher-res camera sensor, 4K videos and hybrid focus against OIS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upgraded chipset - Snapdragon 801 against the "older" Snapdragon 800 - saw the Galaxy S5 come out on top in just about every synthetic benchmark we ran.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery life and better codec support helped the LG G2 snatch a couple of wins, but overall the six-month gap between the two is not to be downplayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether or not this will work in LG's favor another couple of months down the road remains to be seen. And mind you, the one-way traffic here was pretty much expected but not as bad when you factor in the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G2 wasn't in this match solely for the amusement of onlookers. A good 200 euro cheaper, it is still a credible premium package, and sufficiently future-proofed. LG did the G2 a favor by delivering the KitKat update just before the Galaxy S5's release. Ultimately, it's whether the water-resistance, fingerprint scanner, new imaging hardware and the latest chipset are worth that much to you. The other improvements are harder to put a price on but add to the overall experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do your own math of course, and if LG does theirs right, we'd hate to be in the Galaxy S5's place in the next edition of this head-to-head. No need to tell you, we can't wait for the re-match.</paragraph>
