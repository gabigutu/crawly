			<paragraph>Cyber-shot branded phones have been keeping us busy lately. Just as we gave you the 5-megapixel K850, the exciting new recruit Sony Ericsson K770 is on hand. Now, if K850 is the new star on the Cyber-shot team, the Sony Ericsson K770 is the right reinforcement in the midfield. New launches are not always about stunning upgrades in functionality. Design and ease of use are equally important, especially if trying to cater to different tastes and budgets. Slick and refined, the K770 easily stands out in the Cyber-shot crowd. The new phone is an attempt to build upon the design of Sony Ericsson T650. Sony Ericsson K770 packs the good old stuff - 3G, TFT display with QVGA resolution, stereo Bluetooth, FM radio, MP3/MPEG4 player, good 3-megapixel camera. All that with the neat elegance of a bar-shaped handset measuring 14.5 mm in thickness. How good it is in practice is namely our game, so bear with us as we explore the new Cyber-shot contender.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K770 will be available in three color variations - Truffle Brown, Ultra Violet and the recently added Sandy Beige. The one we got to test is obviously the brown one. The K770 has a plastic body, but musters a more refined look. The handset measures 105 x 47 x 14.5 mm and weighs 95 g and is a pleasure to hold. Those are almost equal to the slim T650, which measures 12.5 mm, save the protruded camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TFT display measures 1.9" in diagonal. Just so you get a dimensional perspective, the K810 has a 2" display, while the K850 sports a 2.2" one. Above the display you can see the speaker dead center. The video calls camera is located on its right, while the ambient light sensor is on the left. Most of the Sony Ericsson users out there would be happy to see that Sony Ericsson have ditched the infamous navigation joystick and have replaced it with a sleeker D-pad. The navigation pad of the K770 is even handier compared to our favoiurite D-pad of T650. The keypad has great styling and that's where the key difference lies. The keys are large and very comfortable for typing, wrong keypresses are virtually impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the K770 incorporates the usual Fast port used for attaching the charger and all peripherals. The Fast port is getting relocated on the side of increasingly more Sony Ericsson handsets. We suppose that it has something to do with its increased use for plugging stereo headset for listening to music. The bottom part of the K770 sports only a microphone and holes for attaching a neck or wrist strap. For that purpose you would have to remove the back cover first. The top part of the mobile features the On/Off key and a sliding release key for the back cover much like the one of T650. The On/Off key is really minute but that doesn't pose any usability problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the K770 nests the dual volume key and the camera shutter key. They are all made to blend seamlessly into the handset design. The slight elevation plus the nice tactile feedback provide for a great user-friendliness of the controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the phone body is the camera face. At the bottom you can see the loudspeaker grill and the Sony Ericsson logo. The camera lens and the LED flash with mirror sector are placed at the top. K770 is the first Cyber-shot phone to offer such an elegant camera lens cover. Much like the K850, the camera and the LED flash here are below the back panel surface level. We hope, from now on, Cyber-shot phones keep coming with this elegant styling, and give up the less popular decisions like the K810 choppy back panel. Releasing the lens cover is marked by a blue gleam coming off a thin line of LEDs placed across the back cover. It indicates that the phone starts in camera mode. The On/Off camera key flashes briefly in blue, as well. The camera is quoted at a 3.2 megapixel resolution but, as with some other Sony Ericsson products, its effective megapixel count is calculated by multiplying X x Y pixels, or as it turns out precisely 3.15 megapixels (sorry for being such geeks, but that's just us).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you take off the back cover by sliding the release key located on the handset's top side, several things may attract your attention. The M2 memory card slot is located on the left, not far from the Fast port. It allows hot-swapping memory cards as you don't need to remove the battery. That still is a bit dated design decision though, compared to the highly comfortable quick-release battery cover of K850, that shelters the card slot, the SIM card, and the battery itself. A sort of remedy is that the back panel release key has improved since T650 and is now easy to manage with one hand. The device works with Memory Stick Micro (M2) cards. The SIM card holder is located next to the memory card slot. SIM is removable with the battery off only; forgive us for stating the obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K770 is powered by a Sony Ericsson BST-38 Li-Po battery with a capacity of 930 mAh. Battery times are not yet officially published, but our test handset managed almost 3 days of fair usage in a 3G network - so expect a decent overall performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hands on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K770 proved a very user-friendly device. It handles nicely and pleases with its soft rounded casing. The handset fits perfectly in hand and we were delighted with the ergonomics of all the controls. With dimensions almost on par, the new Cyber-shot fairly outperforms the T650 in design and ergonomics. The keypad with its ample, neat and elevated keys makes the biggest difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Talking about usability, we must pay due attention to the display. We hailed the recent improvements by Sony Ericsson in the display department. With some of its latest models, namely K850 and T650, Sony Ericsson has taken display usability to a higher level. We were delighted with the T650 display and that practically leaves nothing else to say about K770. It seems to be the same piece of hardware used. The quality is beyond comparison particularly with the poor K810 display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display offers improved usability under direct sunlight and some really attractive color effects. When looked from an angle, the K770 display changes colors in an instant when the Under Water Flash Lite theme is used. For example, the standard green color theme of the user interface magically turns blue when looked at from the right. The pictures below demonstrate the effect, or you can go back to the beginning of this review and take a look at the first pictures of the K770 taken from different angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad of the Sony Ericsson K770 offers wide oblong keys, divided by tiny cuts from each other. This is also a step away from the unorthodox keypad design found in K810, K850 and T650. In our humble opinion, keen texters will appreciate them very much. We did find the keys very handy. Responsiveness and tactile feedback will make typos a rarity. The keypad is illuminated in soft white, but generally fails to match other recent Sony Ericsson phones, both on intensity and evenness of the backlighting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: keep it in the family<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in Sony Ericsson K770 is the standard non-smartphone Sony Ericsson UI. It offers great user-friendliness, but new mobiles equipped with it don't offer any new functionality over previous models. Unlike some of the new Sony Ericsson mobiles launched this year (K850 and W910 for example), the K770 user interface lacks the enhanced multimedia capabilities. However, the addition of Flash Lite themes has certainly livened things up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As most previous models, the Sony Ericsson K770 comes with a dedicated Flight mode. When turning on the phone, you may opt to start it directly into Flight mode. Unlike its Nokia S40 user interface rivals, the Sony Ericsson handsets cannot work in Flight mode unless a SIM card is inserted. In active stand-by mode the screen displays information about the network signal, battery strength, current date and time, plus the next alarm that's due. Pressing the navigation pad in any of the four directions can start a user-programmed feature or application. The main menu itself appears as a 4 x 3 grid of animated icons. All sub-menus are in list view with tiny icons on the left side. Response is fast in every submenu and application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking about Flash Lite themes, it must be noted that the K770 not only comes with Flash Lite support, but additionally, some of the preinstalled themes are Flash-based, namely the Aperture theme. Unfortunately, it does not interact with the keypad backlighting as T650. Again, as we use the Underwater flash theme from the T650, the color scheme, the wallpaper, and the menu icons change. The home screen animations also affect the keypad backlighting in an intriguing way. When its animated flying boxes on home screen hit the bottom of the screen, a light wave splatters across the keypad. We have discussed in detail these effects in the review of Sony Ericsson T650, and will no longer dwell on this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with all recent Sony Ericsson handsets, the Sony Ericsson K770 has an Activity menu which has a dedicated key to the tabbed Activity Menu. The Running Apps tab of the menu offers multi-tasking - for example you can run two Java applications and listen to the radio or to the music player simultaneously. The Activity menu also offers quick access to new events, the Web tab and the My Shortcuts tab, which contains a list of frequently used features and can be modified to the user preference.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ring Ring<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K770 is without a doubt good at making and receiving calls. The loudspeaker is loud enough and you wouldn't miss an incoming call even in noisy surroundings. You can hear cracks in tracks with more bass at the highest volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speakerphone test results</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: nothing new<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface is simple and straightforward. Either the SIM or the phone contacts can be set as default for the phonebook. Both lists cannot be displayed simultaneously. Otherwise, you can choose to use the handy option of duplicating any new contacts that you save in the phone's memory to the SIM card. The maximum capacity of the phonebook is 1000 entries but you can save up to 2500 phone numbers - no change here. Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. They are searchable by gradual typing of the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, there are five positions available for phone numbers: Mobile, Home, Work, Fax and Other. This is the first tab of fields for the new contacts. The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture, a custom ringtone and a voice command. The fourth goes for Title, Company and postal address. The last, fifth tab, is for additional information and birth date. Upon adding a birth date, you're prompted to choose whether to add it to the calendar and set a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As most other Sony Ericsson handsets, the Sony Ericsson K770 has a Voice Dialing feature. You can activate it with a longer press on the down or up volume key. In order to use it though, you would have to prerecord your voice commands in a very quiet environment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls log is divided into four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. The tabs can take up to 30 call records altogether, which are shared between the separate tabs. When there are several calls made to a single contact, only the last call gets displayed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Texting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All messages, except emails, use one Inbox. No matter what kind of message has been received, it goes to the common Inbox. Only email messages have their own separate Inbox. The phone also offers an RSS-feed reader, using the NetFront web browser. When typing a message, there is a character counter, which would alert you when you get close to the 160-symbol limit. The T9 dictionary goes without saying. Unfortunately, the Manage Messages and Manage Email applications found in K850 are not available here. Pity, indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client of Sony Ericsson K770 supports a variety of settings and encodings. Settings palette is standard and include connection type, incoming and outgoing server, download S&amp;R, check interval, push email, encryption of the incoming and outgoing server and incoming and outgoing ports.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music and Video: Seen it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K770 music player supports MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC+, WAV, WMA, M4A and MIDI file formats. It is the Walkman player version 1.0, as seen in Sony Ericsson K800 and K810 for example. In fact, most Sony Ericsson W-series handsets feature the same music player with several exceptions. The only difference between theirs and this one is that the one in K770 doesn't feature the MegaBass equalizer preset. Since Sony Ericsson K770 supports multi-tasking, the player can be set to run in the background. Sound is nice - as long you're using the player with a good headset, that is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Until recently, sound quality used to be a subjective matter in our reviews. Realizing that mobile phones are evermore used as portable music players, subjective just won't do any more. That is why we at GSMArena will be including a new audio test in our reviewing routine to give you a more objective view of how the music players in all those handsets perform. So here are the results of the Sony Ericsson K770 and its graph compared to Apple iPod 5th generation and Nokia 7500 Prism.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio quality test results</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frequency response   Sony Ericsson K770 vs. Nokia 7500 Prism ? Sony Ericsson K770 vs. Apple iPod 5G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K770 sounds as good as Walkman branded phone, which is a worthy achievement. A most likely explanation is that a Walkman phone's audio hardware is used in K770. The latter tangibly outperforms Nokia 7500 Prism but keeps some steps behind Apple iPod.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of K770 is decent and videos can be watched in landscape mode. Unfortunately you cannot fast-forward, but still you can play the video in slow motion. The player can zoom in on your video up to 32x.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of the Sony Ericsson K770 has a memory for 20 preset stations and supports RDS. It comes with the proprietary TrackID feature that records several seconds from the track that's currently playing and gives you information on its name and artist.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>In the Picture<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing new in the file browser department as well. It allows you to mark files (single or multiple), copy them, move them, and also create and delete folders as you please. There are three tabs of file lists - one for the phone memory files, one for the memory stick files and one shared for all files. By selecting a given tab you can filter the files shown. The integrated memory of the K770 is 16MB. There is also a Memory Stick Micro M2 memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing your pictures is as easy as ever - you could do that in a list view, with or without thumbnails. You can also view your pictures as a thumbnail grid of 3 x 3 or 5 x 5. The video files can also be browsed as thumbnails. Highlighting a video thumbnail won't make it playing as a preview, as it did in Sony Ericsson K810.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interesting thing about the picture browsing is the Timeline view, which allows you to filter the pictures according to the month they have been taken in. After you specify the month, you could even choose the exact date. That sort of image filtering is offered by computer picture browsers and digital cameras. The Timeline sorting is seen increasingly often in recent Sony Ericsson phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual pictures can be viewed in portrait mode (just as you would on any other phone) or in landscape mode, if you prefer. While you are going through your pictures the phone preloads a lower quality preview for faster browsing. Pausing browsing once you've found a picture, you would like to view in full, will result in loading it with its normal quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even more, up to 32x. Given the available megapixel count, zooming beyond 8x would rather produce smudged spots than reveal more details. While zooming, a minimap of the picture appears to let you know exactly where you are in the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While browsing pictures, you can easily do some basic editing or send them as MMS and email or via Bluetooth and Infrared. Should you choose more sophisticated editing, the PhotoDJ application is at your disposal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With it you can easily adjust levels, lighting, brightness and contrast, remove red-eye effect, apply some color effects to the picture, such as negative and sepia, or add a frame or textbox to the picture. We were pleased with its capabilities - it does great with removing red eyes without spoiling the whole picture.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel again<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K770 comes with a 3 megapixel autofocus camera with a LED flash. The camera user interface is the same as the one we already saw in Sony Ericsson K550, W880, K810 and T650. The camera is quoted at 3.2 megapixel resolution but, as with other Sony Ericsson devices, its effective megapixel count is exactly 3.15 megapixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers night mode, self-timer, panorama, frames, and burst shooting modes. It also features white balance control and several scene-specific presets. Some color effects are available, too. The BestPic shoot mode is not present here. The fellow Cyber-shot K550 didn't have it either. However, the Burst shot mode almost makes up for that. The leftmost and rightmost column of the alphanumeric keys serve a double purpose: in Camera mode they're used for changing the shooting mode, focus, scenes, turn on/off light, zoom in and out and self-timer. Icons with blue backlighting explain the function of each key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to focusing, there is a dedicated macro mode and of course you can turn off the auto focus if you need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our firmware version of the handset, the shutter sound couldn't be switched off via the camera interface; you can only change the sound type. The only way to deal with it is to switch the handset into Silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing the sample images, bear in mind that our test version of K770 has an evident blur on the right side of the picture, probably due to an optical misalignment. Generally, the camera performs very well and produces excellent macro results; however it doesn't reach the other 3 megapixel Cyber-shot models performance. We were particularly curious how the K770 camera competes with the T650 one, and found the results being almost equal in quality, detail and general performance. Based on these facts, we think it's safe to assume that the camera module of K770 is the same, or almost the same, with the camera module of T650.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the video camera are pretty much the same as those for the still camera with very minor differences. K770 captures video at the low QCIF resolution. Not a step up from K810. The Cyber-shot flagship K850 is the only handset in the family to offer QVGA. There's not much point in publishing sample clips taken by phones capturing video in QCIF - there isn't that much to see really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As regards the functionality of the secondary VGA camera, it offers the usual stuff. The other party's video feed is viewed in a large frame in the middle of the screen while you view your own image in a small frame in the lower left corner. There is also a possibility to view your own image mirror-like, meaning that it gets reversed and looks as if you are staring at yourself in a mirror. It's much more natural that way. You can also digitally zoom your image 2x or choose to replace your live video feed with a picture of your taste. You can also do that during an actual video call and it's handy when you want to show the other call party an interesting picture you have taken, for example. The options don't end here. You can also control the exposure compensation of the camera or even switch it into a night mode. There are 3 different video quality modes: Smooth, Sharp and Normal. Smooth delivers a smoother picture flow while Sharp provides more detailed images.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides 3G and GPRS for fast data transfers, video calls and content-streaming support, the handset offers the usual connectivity capabilities such as USB, Bluetooth but there is no Infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As our test proved, the integrated HTML Access NetFront Internet browser is good enough and offers a passable performance. It has plenty of options - you can view the pages fullscreen with no menus showing and you can even browse your Web pages in landscape mode. It has WAP and picture modes. It supports content created for HTML 4.01, xHTML 1.0, CSS and Java script, WAP 2.0. The supported security protocols are SSL/TLS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Smart-fit function of the browser does well fitting the web content onto the screen. Scrolling is fast once the page has loaded completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may also have a look at the available View modes of K770 with Smart-Fit off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K770 supports Bluetooth 2.0 with the Human Interface Device (HID) profile, which allows the phone to be used as a remote control for PC and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Furthermore, the phone could be used as a Bluetooth modem for accessing the Internet on a PC or notebook computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth support also includes the A2DP profile, allowing listening to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K770 supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC, while the remote synchronization works with remote servers. The USB connectivity of the phone has two modes - one for file transfers and one for USB Internet - to put it simply, the second one is for using the phone as a modem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications: the usual suspects<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K770 offers many time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Calculator, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, and Light. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. As mentioned before, when you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar. Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written as simple as messages; T9 dictionary can be used here as well. The Light application let's you control the LED flash and use it as a torch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms are now part of the main menu. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm's behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder doesn't have any limit to the duration of the recordings, since all the free memory is available for the purposes of the application. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one, which you have probably already seen. It offers the basic functions, no bells and whistles. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the well known basic applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include the VideoDJ and MusicDJ. The former is for making video clips from scratch or for editing existing recordings using special transition effects and by adding background music. It can be quite entertaining. MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the additional applications are concerned, the Sony Ericsson K770 cameraphone comes equipped with the Photo Mate and FaceWarp applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo Mate offers help and practical tips for getting the most out of your camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FaceWarp is an interesting and funny piece of software, which is used for manipulating portrait shots by adding funny faces and grimaces.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games on average<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two games preinstalled in the Sony Ericsson K770: the FotoQuestFishing and Solitaire 4 Pack. The amusing FotoQuestFishing takes you underwater. A scuba photographer, you get assignments capturing rare and beautiful marine species on film. Unfortunately, the game is rather easy to complete. If you're fond of solitaire, you will certainly like the fixed-up version of the Solitaire 4 Pack game.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Cyber-shot line is astir. Following the K810, the 5 megapixel monster K850 took a bow. Having recently given you the leader of the Cyber-shot pack, we had our hands on the sleek and thin 3 megapixel K770. We liked this Cyber-shot for its design and friendly handling. A bit of a disappointment is the stale user interface. The other serious drawback is the low video capturing resolution. The photo quality couldn't impress us either, as it wasn't near the one of its Cyber-shot elder brothers. The camera performance was further beaten down by the lack of a xenon flash and the lack of the BestPic shooting mode. So in all honesty, the new Sony Ericsson K770 seems pretty much as a Cyber-shot-branded replica of the T650. Fair enough, there's nothing wrong with trying to build on a successful design. Without much effort, Sony Ericsson adds a stylish mid-range handset to its Cyber-shot lineup.</paragraph>
