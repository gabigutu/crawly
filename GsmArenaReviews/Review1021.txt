			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Vivo enjoyed a good run with the X-series in 2015 and even snatched the world's slimmest phone title with the local Chinese version of the X5Max. In 2016, the company is obviously trying to carry that momentum into the midrange with the V-series.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company has made a name for collecting great ideas from rival manufacturers and putting a spin of its own to them. The V3Max is no different but now that Vivo already rings a bell globally, perhaps it's about time it stopped looking around for inspiration and played to its own strengths.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having said that, the Vivo V3Max is hardly a risk taker. It bets heavily on the exterior it seems, like every other Vivo phone, and has more than reasonable specs for the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, here are the phone's key features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivo comes across as quite adequately equipped and even though its design isn't brand new, it has e distinct premium feel and the usual solid build. The Snapdragon 652 is quite capable in combination with the Adreno 405 GPU. The camera setup looks like a decent package too, with a 13MP rear unit with a f/2.0 aperture. Vivo has a thing for this sensor and it did quite well for them in previous phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where things take a weird turn is the software department. The V3Max runs Android 5.1 (step it up to Marshmallow already, Vivo!) with the heavily customized FunTouch OS. The skin has a definite Apple feel to it and could be a deal breaker for die-hard Android fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With that in mind, we're about to start exploring this Chinese offering. Coming up next is the usual unboxing and hardware checkup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard retail package with a bonus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max arrives in a stylish white box with separately packaged accessories inside. The bundle has the basics covered, starting with an extra bulky 9V/2A AC adapter, a USB cable and a headset with a single-button remote and round cords. Additionally, you get a USB-OTG adapter and a silicon case, which is a nice bonus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vivo V3Max 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max measures 153.9 x 77.1 x 7.6 mm and weighs 168g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a 5.5" smartphone, that's a manageable size but it would hardly win any awards. Consider this, it's almost identical in size to the 5.7-inch Galaxy Note5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the company is adamant, it appears, that a good-looking smartphone has got to be thin and the V3Max doesn't go above the 8mm threshold.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Over the past year or so, Vivo has proven one thing - the iPhone 6 design is the main inspiration for the exterior of its phones. Similar to the X6, the V3Max has that iPhone vibe to it. In fact, you can look at the phone like an enlarged Vivo X6, although with slight differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basics, however, are more or less the same. The V3Max is cast inside a metallic unibody with an aluminum alloy rear and a curvy 2.5D tempered glass front. The company says the back of the phone is sand blaster with zircon and is anodized to achieve a "shimmering" effect. While we don't really see any shimmering, we appreciate the fine finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, you can only admire the effort Vivo has put in the V3Max in a gold color option. Currently, it's the only one available and we're quite surprised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of handling, the phone is quite slippery, as you'd expect from a fit and finish like this. It's still not as bad as the glass back of a Galaxy S6 edge, but you should be careful how you handle the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max sports a fingeprint sensor at the back. While holding the phone, you'll naturally place your index finger right on it and that's the logic behind its placement. It's ultra-fast and takes less than a second to recognize your fingerprint and unlock the phone, just like on the X6.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The sides of the phone are another place where Vivo has taken a personal approach. It has sharp edges going all the way around, not like Apple's smooth curves. It may not look as good, but does make for a more secure grip. Both the power button and the volume rocker are on the right side, while the left is reserved for the card slot. We should note that the buttons offer a very nice, tactile feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up top, there's the 3.5mm headphone jack surrounded by an antenna cutout in the metal case. The bottom houses the V3Max's powerful speakers sitting behind a tastefully designed triple grille. Next to it is the microUSB port and mic hole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is a done in a traditional Vivo manner. Below the display, there are three capacitive keys. At the top, there's the 8MP front-facer, an earpiece and a bunch of sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, the Vivo V3Max follows the company's design blueprint from previous models, most notably the Vivo X6. That's not a bad thing, but we would've liked to see something new from the company in 2016.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The source of the design may be questionable, but the V3Max looks and feels premium and appears to have used quality materials.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good 5.5" display, but not a chart-topper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max is equipped with a 5.5" FullHD IPS LCD screen with a pixel density of 401ppi. Sharpness is really good. Colors look good in terms of saturation as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is quite bright at 600nits and it's among the brightest LCD screens we've seen lately, matching more expensive phones such as the Moto X Play, the Xiaomi Mi 5 and the Apple iPhone 6s Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, unlike those phones, the high brightness here is joined by lackluster black representation, resulting in a contrast ratio of 903:1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, in this respect the LCD unit is good, but we would have enjoyed deeper blacks and hence higher contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the same time, the minimum brightness of 7nits should allow for comfortable operation with the phone even in the darkest environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to color rendition, our colorimeter showed that the Vivo V3Max's screen has a notable purplish tint of the whites and grays. It may be really hard to see with your naked eyes without a reference color patch but it's there. The average DeltaE we measured was 6.6, while the maximum DeltaE was 14.0. This sort of a color deviation is around the average we usually measure on LCDs and while okay for everyday use, it means the screen is hardly color calibrated to show a true representation of all colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is okay, backed up by the V3Max's high birghtness. Mind you, a good amount of reflectivity is present, but it doesn't hurt legibility once you crank up the brightness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The battery inside the Vivo V3Max is a 3,000mAh unit. While it's an adequate size, it's not that big, especially considering the dimensions of the phone. Perhaps it's the maximum Vivo could afford to place inside, given the phone's slim profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The V3Max managed nearly 29 hours of 3G talk time, which is fantastic. The web browsing score is 10 and a half hours, while video playback came in at 9 hours and 48 minutes. All that works out to an overall endurance rating of 70 hours. Standby battery efficiency turned out average.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max features dual-SIM with dual-standby. One of the SIM cards gets the full 2G/3G/4G treatment across multiple bands each, while the other is limited to 2G. The slot inside the phone is hybrid, meaning you have to choose between a secondary SIM card and a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone has dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n with DLNA, Wi-Fi direct and hotspot support. The hotspot doesn't get a quick toggle though, and you have to delve into the settings to turn it on. There's Bluetooth v4.1, but no NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has GPS, GLONASS and Beidou support for location services. There's also an FM radio receiver, but no RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB On-The-Go and lets you attach peripherals and you can also daisy chain several devices. A standard 3.5mm jack completes the wired connectivity package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Funtouch OS runs on dated Android 5.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop with Vivo's custom Funtouch OS overlay on top. As with other Chinese manufacturers, that means a single-tiered interface with no app drawer. Vivo steps it up a notch and bakes a lot of Apple-esque user interface touches to Android, making for an interesting mashup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end result is a slick user interface with a slew of features, making for an interesting Android skin. That being said, there's also a lot Vivo can further polish. Many menus and some features are hidden under layers of shortcuts and obscure menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen can be heavily customized and features notifications - a feature Google introduced with Lollipop. The other modifications come in the form of two shortcuts in the bottom corners - dialer and camera by default. However, you do get to assign any other app of your choice to either one. Lockscreen themes are also an option for further customization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Past the lockscreen you get the same single-tier interface with no app drawer. The number of homescreen panes doesn't appear to be limited to a single page of thumbs (which holds 9) and we quickly concluded you won't be left without room for new apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can rearrange the homescreens any way you like and the pane you place first is the default one that appears when you tap the Home button. The panes cannot be cycled, which can prove a problem if you have a large number set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is where all your apps reside after installation. You can group the app icons in folders and tapping on a folder shows its contents in a nicely animated popup on a blurred background (sound familiar?). There's a dock on the bottom of the homescreen, which takes up to 5 icons, folders included, and redistributes them evenly, depending on the number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meanwhile, swiping up from the bottom edge brings out a combined toggles/brightness/tasks drawer, reminiscent of the iOS Control center. Closing apps works with a cheerful "Speed up" button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness slider doesn't take taps if you want to jump straight to a specific position, instead you need to grab it by the handle each time. There's an Auto switch too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The toggles offer the expected functionality and aside from the simple on/off action, work as shortcuts to the respective setting upon a long press. All of them are listed in a singled side-scrollable row, and you can rearrange them or hide the unused ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max comes with extensive gesture and motion functionality, found in settings under Smart motion. Smart wake works with the display off and lets you draw letters to launch specific apps, unlock with an upward swipe without lighting the screen beforehand or launch the camera with a downward swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's Smart Split, which allows you to split the display and launch two apps side-by-side.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Vivo equipped the V3Max with the octa-core Snapdragon 652 chipset - the first to feature a Cortex-A72 processor - the successor to the A57. The exact Snapdragon 652 configuration in the V3Max is four 1.8GHz Cortex-A72 and four 1.4GHz Cortex-A53.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPU is also no slouch in the graphics department with an Adreno 510 GPU, and there is also 4GB of RAM. Sounds nice, let's see how it does in benchmark tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the CPU intensive GeekBench 3, where the V3Max fails to score as well as the similarly spec'd Samsung Galaxy A9. The reason is that GeekBench 3 tests the single-core performance of the Cortex-A53 core, which isn't exactly a speed champion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, multi-core results show the V3Max in a slightly better light, not too far off from the Snapdragon 810 rocking Moto X Force.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compound AnTuTu benchmark places the V3Max way ahead of the Galaxy A9 and its Snapdragon 617. While the V3Max isn't comparable to most flagships, it doesn't fall too far behind the Moto X Force.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 510 GPU is quite recent, but still an entry-level graphics chip compared to the Adreno 530 or even the Adreno 430 of the past year's crop of flagships. As a result, the Vivo V3Max and Galaxy A9 managed the same result, far behind the LG5 and HTC 10.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BaseMark X shows that Vivo has managed to optimize the Adreno 510 GPU better than Samsung. Here, we see the V3Max beat the Galaxy A9 ever so slightly again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark ES 3.1 / Metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Snapdragon 652 was a wise choice for Vivo. Not only does this chipset feature the new Cortex-A72 CPU, but it's also got the capable Adreno 510 GPU and loads of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result, you get close to flagship-grade performance for a third of the price. The feature-heavy Funtouch OS runs very nicely on Android 5.1.1 and there are no hiccups to report.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During our testing, the V3Max didn't get unpleasantly warm at all, despite the 28nm chip. Kudos to both Qualcomm and Vivo for pulling it off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the Vivo V3Max is called Contacts and follows the general styling of the rest of the interface, meaning it's entirely custom. There are tabs, but unless you are big on groups, or want to jump to the dialer or to your personal info page all the time, chances are you won't be using them too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact is done through a clean and well-arranged interface. All in all Vivo has tried to keep things as simple and intuitive as possible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max comes with a simple gallery. It consists of two tabs, one for your camera roll, the other for your various albums. Either way, you get a grid of thumbnails, four in a row. Hitting the search tool doubles the number of thumbs and groups them by month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a single image offers the usual basic options like cropping and rotation as well as a quick shortcut for sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max comes with a dedicated video application. It offers a quite basic interface and few advanced features, but definitely gets the job done. The player itself does offer Hi-Fi support as well as DLNA and subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as format support goes, the V3Max didn't have any issues with playing every video we threw at it, be it DivX, XviD, MOV, WMV, MP4, MKV, including files with the typically problematic AC3 sound. It also has good support for subtitles, though no options for customizing them. Another interesting feature is the pop-out mode. It spawns a small draggable video window on top of the UI, but you can't resize it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio player has headphone profiles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player, bundled with Funtouch OS and curiously named iMusic, doesn't look overly impressive but is quite pleasant to use and has a few tricks hidden away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Launching the app brings you to a selection of quite a few browsing options. Songs can be browsed in various categories and playlists are easily accessible, for even more flexibility. The smartphone comes with preinstalled sound profiles for a few headsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main playback interface consists of a backdrop of album art and a simple control pad. You get two toggles altogether, one for Repeat/Shuffle and another for switching on Hi-Fi mode, but it only works with headphones attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Vivo V3Max's big audio feature is its Hi-Fi prowess. The phone features AKM's 32-bit/192kHz AK4375 DAC. Provided you have the right headphones and the right source material, it could potentially allow you to play Hi Res Audio audio.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output starts off great, loses some brilliance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo V3Max went off to a great start in our audio quality test. When connected to an active external amplifier, it delivered very loud output with excellent clarity scores top to bottom ? an impressive showing by any standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones though and things quickly go south. Volume drops to average, stereo crosstalk increases notably and some intermodulation distortion creeps in. It?s still a perfectly adequate performance, but it?s not quite as impressive as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here go the results so you can make your own comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max comes with a 13MP sensor sitting behind a f/2.0 lens. OIS is missing here, as it's reserved for pricier models. Still, there's a dual-LED flash and an 8MP camera at the front, which also supports interpolated 52MP Ultra HD photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is incredibly simplistic with only a few options laying around. This, of course, is definitely not bad in itself, but a phone, which is praised because of an impressive camera, needs to have something to impress with on the software side, as well as the hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want, you can also fiddle with manual camera settings in the Professional mode. Shutter speed, ISO, white balance and even focus distance can all be adjusted manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also offers some visual goodies, like effects and water-marks. All of them can be previewed live and applied to both shots and clips, which is nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are, of course, standard modes, like HDR, Face beauty and Panorama, which we have come to expect from any modern phone. But there are also dedicated sports and Night modes, which is a nice little touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP sensor proved its merit with previous Vivo smarthpones and here it shines as well. Sharpness is good all around, while colors are overall accurate. Dynamic range is also satisfactory, but not particularly wide. We should note a dash of underexposure, which seems to be a common issue with Vivo cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR fixes a lot where the scene is underexposed. The level of detail is the same and the effect isn't really that dramatic, but is noticeable when compared to a non-HDR snap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panorama output of the V3Max isn't particularly good. When shot in portrait, the images are about 1,800 pixels tall and 180-degree shot results in an image that's a little over 8 megapixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stitching is alright, with the obvious exception of moving objects and ones close by. The level of detail is underwhelming and exposure, as you could probably guess by now, isn't good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned, the Vivo V3Max also shoots Ultra HD. The photos are 8320 x 6240 pixels, resulting in a nudge below 52MP. The overall detail is good, but there's quite a bit of noise. Nevertheless, we are pleased with the dynamic range and color accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can take a look at how the Vivo V3Max stacks up against the competition in our Photo Compare Tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP front-facing snapper offers good detail, but it is a tad on the soft side. In addition, photos are a little noisy, but overall the camera gets the job done.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo V3Max shoots standard-issue video up to 1080p/30fps as well as slow motion and high-speed videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slow motion recording is downgraded to 720p resolution, though, and doesn't offer as much quality and as good exposure as the regular shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p videos are shot with a bitrate of 20Mbps, and the dual-channel audio is recorded at 97kbps. Video quality leaves a lot to be desired. Dynamic range isn't very good and the camera has a hard time focusing. Colors, at least, are somewhat accurate, but bad contrast isn't helping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast motion mode is called Fast video and shoots at the full 1080p resolution at four times the speed. The speed aside, its qualities are very much the same as the regular speed mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we've provided an untouched sample, shot at 1080p@30fps (00:15min, 37MB) for download from our server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can check out our Video Compare Tool to see how the Vivo V3Max fares against the competition when it comes to video capturing.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two browsers are better than one<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max comes with Google Chrome as well as a custom browser. Its interface definitely looks nice, and like everything else in Funtouch OS, it fits well into the general design outline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tab selection interface is similar to a desktop browser and eats away screen estate, so it's great that it can be hidden with a toggle in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handy Text-only mode will help cut down on data traffic, while Night mode will reduce strain on your eyes in dark environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internal browser also supports Night mode, which is useful for those sleepless browsing nights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vivo has also included Google Chrome in the app mix. It is gradually establishing itself as one of the most popular mobile browsers and it should be fairly familiar to anyone who's owned an Android smartphone before.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Vivo has kept things pretty clean in terms of preloaded applications and, besides the nowadays obligatory Google suite, there are few pre-installed apps. Also, the things that are included in the mix are generally well executed, nicely styled and even, quite convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, Funtouch OS has an amazing central management hub, called iManager. It is designed to keep your phone in top shape and generally does a pretty good job of it. It can clean your RAM and storage on request and naturally manage applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivo V3Max comes with WPS Office preinstalled. It's a full-featured office editor that can handle Word docs, PDFs, Spreadsheets and Presentations. It can link to cloud storage, email files, and create a shared view with other users and more. There's editing enabled, too, so you can get some work done on the go, if need be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the other bundled apps have nothing really spectacular to offer, except, perhaps, slick looks. The calendar is straightforward. It can seamlessly sync with your google account and naturally has events, reminders and all of the standard week, month and daily views, but also a year view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also comes with a very intuitive file manager. It automatically groups things according to type, but also allows traditional folder browsing, as well as searching. Multiple file operations are now possible too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Vivo V3Max key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>High-quality materials and great build quality;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.5" FullHD IPS LCD is sharp and plenty bright, but blacks are not as deep as on other phones;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Very good battery life with an endurance rating of 70h and solid standby times;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Raw chipset performance is solid, as the Snapdragon 652 is one of the best midrange chipsets right now;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudspeaker posted a Good score, which is more than some flagship models;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Funtouch OS is still based on the older Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, but it's chockfull of features;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amount of pre-installed apps means you are covered in terms of media consumption, and although the gallery is basic, the image editor has a lot of options; the video player supports a wide range of codecs and the music player is straightforward and functional;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Solid audio quality, loud output through the headphones thanks to the dedicated Hi-Fi DAC;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>13MP main camera renders a lot of detail. Exposure is dependable, dynamic range is limited</paragraph>
			<paragraph>8MP selfie cam produces accurate skin tones, but its output is rather soft</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p video is lacking in detail and offers low in dynamic range; 4x fast motion mode is the same in quality and is genuinely useful; 1/4x slow motion is 720p, but not of quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the end, it always comes down to finding the right balance. Customers want the most bang for the buck with the least amount of compromises possible. Seemingly quite aware of this dynamic, Vivo based its strategy on upmarket finish and feel but did well to not overlook the equipment and performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, some may argue that Vivo's taking a risk by going too upmarket perhaps for a relatively low profile brand. That could well be a skewed perspective though - maybe Vivo knows its target markets well enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The V3Max is the best device the company can offer in the midrange although this doesn't mean much on markets long dominated by more established brands. To Vivo's credit, the phone appears very well built - something we've become accustomed to with Vivo handsets. If you can get over the Apple knockoff look and feel, you'll get to appreciate the premium quality finish and comfortable handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first place to look for alternatives is right next door where rivals Oppo have the R5 and R7. The smaller-screened 5.2-inch R5 loses by a country mile - for every full battery charge on the V3Max you'll need to do two on the R5, and no fast charging tech will offset that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A9 has a marginally larger footprint, and at 7.4mm is not exactly thick either. It has a larger 4000mAh battery and it shows in the superior battery endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX4 Pro is worth a look as well. Yes, it's thicker than the V3Max, but it's cheaper, its 5.5-inch display has QHD resolution, its camera can shoot 4K video, and it will significantly outlast the V3Max in terms of battery life if you're mostly into web browsing. It also has a fingerprint sensor. The newly released MX5 is worth a look too as it's thinner, while retaining most of its predecessor's virtues, save for the QHD resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up on the contender list is Xiaomi with the Redmi Note 3. The phone offers Snapdragon 650 performance for half the price. It's not as thin as the V3Max, but the added nearly 2mm bulk translates to a larger battery, which some may appreciate more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LeEco Le 1s sports a MediaTek Helio X10 chipset, which for its price (nearly half the V3Max's) is awesome. Its only caveat is the poor battery life, but other than that the 13MP camera records 4K video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo has a similar offering with the Vibe K4 Note. The 5.5-incher packs MediaTek MT6753, which isn't as potent as the Snapdragon 652, but is solid enough offering adequate performance. The battery is larger, too at 3,300mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lastly, let's not forget the never settling OnePlus 2. It has a similar price tag to the V3Max and offers Snapdragon 810 chipset, vanilla Android experience and a solid 13MP shooter with 4K recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The V3Max is another well-built and decently equipped phone from Vivo, which shouldn't come as a surprise if you caught a glimpse of the likes of the X5Max and the X6. The phone easily looks better than most midrange alternatives, including ones from major brands and has one of the fastest fingerprint sensors around. The premium DAC is another nice surprise but it probably contributes to a price tag that might put many people off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing, looking at the shiny metal case that screams iPhone one may think they spent all their budget on the outside and put all sorts of rubbish inside. They would of course be wrong but the copycat design may always backfire.</paragraph>
