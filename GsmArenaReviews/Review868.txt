			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Grand lineup, in its short history, has been all about two things: screen size and dual SIM support on a shoestring budget. With screen real estate getting cheaper all the time, Grand phones are targeting fans of big screens who aren't looking to break the bank to have one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest installment in the lineup, the Neo, brings the Galaxy Grand to an even more competitive price point, although understandably, that required a few sacrifices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But just how good is a Neo going to be when it comes to the Grand concept? Let's take a closer look at the specs, and how they're different from the original Galaxy Grand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big screen aside, the Grand Neo is decidedly an entry-level device, even more so than its predecessor used to be at launch. As you can expect at this screen size, the WVGA resolution is stretched rather thin resulting in a paltry pixel density of just 186 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a Broadcom chipset similar to the ones Samsung has been putting into its lower tier of devices, except this time it's of the quad-core variety. It's the first time we're dealing with a quad-core Broadcom CPU in a Samsung, so we're curious to see how it fares when stacked up to its dual-core counterpart in the original Galaxy Grand. Keep in mind that on the Neo we have a Cortex-A7 vs. the Cortex-A9 on the original.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processor is where the upgrades end compared to the Galaxy Grand. In fact, moving to the camera department you're greeted by a 5MP primary shooter capable of 720p video, and a VGA front-facer that's even less impressive. This is a marked step down from the 8MP fullHD shooter on the original Grand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that our review unit is of the single SIM variety, but the differences between the two versions of the Neo is marginal boils down to a slight difference in battery life due to the two active radios in the Dual SIM variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next we'll take a closer look at the hardware features of the Galaxy Grand Neo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With its 5-inch screen the Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo measures 143.7 x 77.1 x 9.6 mm, virtually identical to the original Galaxy Grand - the two being separated by only 0.2mm in height and width.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weight-wise, the Grand Neo comes in at 163g - again just about identical to the original Grand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Grand Neo follows the rather predictable and uninspired design Samsung has been using on its more affordable offerings for quite some time now. The matte finish on the back, however, is a breath of fresh air, as it doesn't feature the fingerprint-prone gloss found on most entry-level Samsung's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display you get the usual three navigation keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display rests an earpiece and some sensors for proximity and ambient light, as well as a front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only two buttons on the sides of the device are the volume rocker on the left and power/lock button on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up top is a 3.5mm audio jack, while at the bottom you'll find the microUSB port and microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the back is the 5MP shooter flanked by an LED flash and a loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking off the back panel is a bit of a pain as the tabs, which hold it in place, are a bit overzealous. Underneath, you'll find the removable 2100mAh battery alongside the SIM and microSD card ports, neither of which is hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life of the Grand Neo turned out to be a very respectable 59 hours, thanks in large part to its great standby time. Voice calling was another area where the 2,100 mAh battery excelled, while web browsing and multimedia videos aren't as good.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've gone over how the WVGA resolution of the Galaxy Grand Neo stretches rather thin on the large display, resulting in a less than optimal 186 pixels per inch. Nevertheless, for a budget-range device you still get excellent colors and decent viewing angles. The 5-inch display also makes for some superior usability compared to smaller 4-inch offerings, as on-screen keyboards and buttons feel markedly less cramped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the contrast leaves something to be desired, and is worse than the one found on the original Galaxy grand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility comes in about the same - towards the bottom of the chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When we put the pixels of the Grand Neo under our digital microscope we can see where the differences come from. While both devices have the same inline RGB panel, the ones on the Neo are shaped differently and slightly tilted.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo handles well in large part to the pleasantly-textured matte finish on the back panel. Unlike the glossy plastic finish found on most budget Samsung droids, the back panel makes the device comfortable to hold in hand and is highly resistant to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our only complaint when it comes to the Grand aesthetics is that the design language has been used by Samsung for almost two years now and has only been losing its appeal. Not to mention you would have a hard time telling some of their midrange smartphones apart just by looking at them. It deserves a point deduction for its complete lack of character.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface with TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo runs on Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean skinned with Samsung's TouchWiz Nature UX. Its entry-level status means it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the latest Galaxy flagships, but the quad-core processor and WVGA screen resolution means it'll be able to run Android quickly without needing too much horsepower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've shot a quick video showing off the user interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the time, the Galaxy Grand Neo's lockscreen widgets can be customized to give you quick access to email, a selection of app shortcuts, the calendar app, and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in unskinned Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is identical to what you get on most Samsung devices since the Jelly Bean release. You can move between multiple panes with left or right swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping down from the top bar reveals the notification area, where you'll see five toggles at the top, which are used to quickly enable and disable some of the phone's features. You can reveal more by swiping left, or simply display a full liserter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A two finger swipe down on the notification banner directly opens the grid of toggles, and holding down on a toggle will directly take you to the relevant setting. Otherwise, swipe left or right to quickly dismiss a notification, or tap it for more information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes, where you can have as many as 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dragging an app or widget onto a homescreen is made easier thanks to the small thumbnails that show up with silhouettes of how they're populated. This gives you an at-a-glance look at how much room you have to work with on each homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer can be sorted as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and some shortcuts can be hidden - good for bloatware you can't uninstall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher (accessed by holding down the home button) shows a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, which can be swiped away to dismiss. There are three buttons at the bottom: Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has included its Multi-window feature, which lets you run two apps side-by-side at the same time. Simply expand the Multi-window bar from the side of the screen using its arrow shortcut, and drag an app onto the homescreen. Dragging a second app on top will split the screen between the two apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now lets you use voice commands and integrates with your Google account to provide all sorts of information from internet searches to your daily routine, localized traffic, and current weather conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung devices also come with the included S Voice voice assistant. While Google Now focuses on more search related and organizational activities, S Voice allows you to control your phone directly. You can call, text, launch apps, control music, change sound settings and much more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Jelly Bean iteration of TouchWiz is highly customizable and offers rich functionality. As expected, most of the flagship features are missing in the Galaxy Grand Neo - but the lack of Samsung's Air gestures are not a huge deal-breaker in our view.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has, by and large, turned to Broadcom for many of their recent entry-level and midrange devices, and the Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo in no exception. It's powered by a quad-core 1.2GHz Broadcom BCM23550 chip, and is the first time we've seen a Broadcom chip in a quad-core configuration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Grand Neo quad-core chipset utilizes Cortex-A7 cores. BenchmarkPi tests the individual core performance so having four of them brings no extra points. In this test, the original Galaxy Grand fares better than the newcomer as it has a dual-core chipset, which is based on Cortex-A9 cores rather than Cortex-A7s.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 3 factors in memory performance into the equation. Here the Grand Neo did not stack up well against the competition, but you have got to remember it runs against mostly flagship-grade devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Quadrant, a compound benchmarks, which takes into account not only CPU performance, but also memory and GPU, the Galaxy Grand Neo's quad-core chipset achieved a score equal to that of the dual-core chipset in the original Grand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And in Antutu, another compound benchmark, the quad-core Broadcom chipset was able to shoot the Galaxy Grand Neo well ahead of the Galaxy Grand with almost a double score.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The VideoCore IV GPU found in the Grand Neo is decidedly several steps behind most flagship and midrange GPU's, so we've brought back our NenaMark 2 test to get a more accurate representation of performance. The Gran Neo does better than the Galaxy Ace 3, which features the same GPU but a lower-clocked dual-core processor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put the graphic performance in perspective with more robust offerings, we ran the Grand Neo through the GFXBench T-Rex test at 1080p offscreen mode. The meager 1.8fps is markedly unimpressive, but chances are it will never have to face 1080p screens in real life.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we move on to the web browsing benchmarks, which has been traditionally a strong point for Broadcom processors, particularly when it comes to HTML 5. The Grand Neo performed on par with most of the droids in its class, but when it comes to more capable midrangers and flagships it doesn't stand a chance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see, the new quad-core chipset of the Galaxy Grand Neo is certainly not a clear cut winner. In single thread processes it's actually almost 20% slower than the older dual-core chipset, but in all other applications, which would make use of its multi-core architecture, it's either equal or substantially better than the dual-core solution used in the original Galaxy Grand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A comparison to the Mediatek MT6589 chipset, used in the Xperia C might also be interesting, as it's based on the same 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 cores as the Broadcom BCM23550 chipset in the Galaxy Grand Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, it's substantially faster in single core performance (BenchmarkPi is almost 30% better). It turned well ahead in compound benchmarks too, being 6% better in Antutu and 20% better in Quadrant. The reason for the better compound performance may as well be due to a better GPU (PowerVR SGX544) being used in Mediatek's chipset. Our GPU-intensive GFXBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen) testified for that by reporting 34% higher frame rate for the Xperia C than the Galaxy Grand Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It gets even more interesting if we recall the results from the recently reviewed HTC Desire 700 dual sim. It uses a similar chipset to those two. It comes from the relatively unknown company Spreadtrum. Called Shark, this quad-core package utilizes 1.2Ghz Cortex-A7 cores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite its menacing name, the Shark did even worse in our benchmarks. The Broadcom chipset in the Grand Neo was 10% better than the Spreadtrum Shark in the single-threaded BenchmarkPi; it fared 13% better in the compound benchmark Antutu; and it finished off with an 18% better score in the compound Quadrant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the obviously superior Mali-400 GPU in the Spreadtrum Shark was not able to help its case in these compound benchmarks. It showed as the better performer in the GPU-intensive GFXBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen) with a 12% better score than the PowerVR SGX544 in Xperia C and a good 44% better score than the unnamed GPU in the Grand Neo's Broadcom BCM23550 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we would say that the Broadcom BCM23550 chipset used in the Galaxy Grand Neo is a good budget chipset but it's certainly behind the completion when it comes to graphic-intensive apps such as games.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The full-featured phonebook is divided into sections that are straightforward and easy to navigate. A call or a message to someone can be initiated directly from the contact list with a right and left swipe respectively, which is really handy on the go and is currently a proprietary Samsung feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the phone book finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt you to join them. Furthermore, you can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a specific vibration pattern as an incoming call alert for each of your contacts, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with native video calling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Grand Neo has great earpiece volume and Samsung has even gone as far as adding an in-call equalizer, which does wonders if you want an even louder experience. Native video calls are available right in the phone app, and Smart Dial works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Direct Call is available too and lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts or reading/composing a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have the dual-SIM variant of the Galaxy Grand Neo, you'll get a special dual-SIM interface in the settings menu. This lets you rename your SIM cards for easy identification as well as choose which card to use for establishing mobile data network connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo's loudspeaker earned a score of Good in our dedicated loudspeaker test, which means that you shouldn't have a hard time hearing notifications in all but the loudest of environments. You can find more about the testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great messaging capabilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Thanks to its organized threaded view, the messaging department is quite straightforward. It features the same quick swipe gestures found in the phonebook, although they likely won't be used as much here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the larger screen, typing is easier than on smaller droids, Samsung or otherwise. Swype-inspired finger tracking is also present, but has limited language support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional input methods include a regular handwriting and Google's voice input, which can work even offline if you've downloaded the required language files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message, like photos or video, automatically turns it into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can customize your speech bubble patterns and background, and use the volume keys to increase or decrease the font in conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app includes the four inbox options (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates) that Google recently introduced in their online interface. Samsung's own Email app is similar to Google's, except that it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes, which is useful for when you want to keep track of multiple accounts from one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hangouts app is Google's attempt at creating a one-stop shop for all of your IM needs. The app offers group video chats, emojis, photo exchange, history sync across multiple devices, and can even be integrated to handle your SMS conversations as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Feature-rich gallery but no air view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Grand Neo is quite similar to what you get on the Galaxy S4 flagship, with the notable absence of the Air View feature that lets you hover your finger over an album to see the images it contains.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing an album's contents, a right swipe will reveal a bar that lets you browse images in split-screen mode. You can also use a pinch gesture to adjust the size of the thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery naturally supports full-res images which results in a pleasant viewing experience thanks to the ample screen and sharp colors. There's even an Adobe RGB screen more for even more accurate color rendering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily edit photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects, and even lets you write a note over the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery supports slideshows too, with several transition effects to choose from and customizable music and speed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including .FLAC, .WAV, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album, Playlist, etc. but there's also Folder support that's quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on so many other players. It can also search for content on other devices like PCs on the same network via its DLNA functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one with 7 bands) along with sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology from its MP3 and Android-powered media players, which features 7.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Music square feature that's is quite similar to Sony's SensMe. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and lets you build playlists based on mood rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options as well lyrics support, and an AllShare shortcut for streaming content to other devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Grand Neo comes equipped with an FM Radio with RDS. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 12 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it acts as the antenna. You can record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent video player, but no DivX or AC3 codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo features a thumbnail view by default, which on more advanced Samsung phones would be animated but on the Grand Neo are static.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides being able to choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen, you can also adjust the brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans all available subtitle files, so the file doesn't even have to have the same name as the video file as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is capable enough outside the glaring omission of the DivX video codec support and the AC3 audio codec support, both of which are subject to license fees so we guess they were scrapped out of economical reasoning.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera is not bad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo comes with a 5MP primary camera and a 0.3MP front-facer, which is a marked downgrade from the Galaxy Grand predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder handles both still and video capture, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution - if you're shooting full resolution 5MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go over the different modes. There are standard modes like Panorama, Night, and Sports. Panoramas are nice; they do a full 360-degree circle, but the resolution is not that impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound &amp; shot captures a photo and records ambient sound. It sounds pretty cool - for example, you can hear the sea gulls in a beach photo or the roar of car engines at a race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos tend to have accurate contrast and colors. We did notice a tendency to overexpose the shots in certain conditions (our macro shot for instance). We also noticed signs of an overly-aggressive noise reduction here and there, resulting in a watercolor effect on the foliage, but it's nothing too bad. Despite the noise reduction, there is still a lot of visible noise left, but it's only of the luminance type and it doesn't get in the way, so we'd say it's actually ok. In the end, the camera on the Galaxy Grand Neo may not be something to write home about, but it doesn't have any serious flaws and it's actually quite usable in good light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the Galaxy Grand Neo camera samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo camera is one of the few still in 5MP-land, but that doesn't prevent you from comparing it to the larger camera sensors found on most flagships with our Photo Compare Tool. You can also see how it stacks up to the original Grand's camera for instance.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>720p video capture leaves much to be desired<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo stores videos in MP4 files with a bitrate of just over 12Mbps on average. Audio is recorded in mono at 62Kbps and a sampling rate of 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available before and during video recording and you can switch back to continuous autofocus if you prefer. You can capture 720p still images during recording, and the samples come out with the same quality as the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured with the Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo have very poor resolved detail, even for just a 720p camera. Videos come out highly pixelated and tend to have a very poor visual effect, even detracting from the otherwise accurate colors and exposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is also an untouched video sample from the Galaxy Grand Neo that you can download directly - 720p @ 30fps(16s, 23.8MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basic connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of connectivity, the Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo starts off with the basics - quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Grand Neo uses Bluetooth 4.0 alongside Wi-Fi support which includes b/g/n with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Unfortunately, there is no USB On-the-go functionality that would have allowed connecting USB peripherals to the Grand Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use the Group Play app to link with other nearby Samsung devices via wireless access point, and share files, play games, and even play music while using connected devices as speaker satellites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Link (previously known as AllShare Play) is another proprietary service offered by Samsung. Once you download the dedicated app, it automatically syncs all the multimedia content on your device to a cloud storage service of your choice (Sugarsync, Box.Net, Dropbox, or Skydrive). This way your content is not only securely backed up, but it's also available for instant watching/listening on your other Samsung devices (and even your Samsung SmartTV). They are available of course on all your other computers and devices that have access to these cloud storage services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Samsung's AllShare feature you can also mirror your mobile device screen to your HDTV via Wi-Fi Direct and the widely supported Miracast protocol - that would even allow you to play mobile games on the biggest screen in your living room. You don't need to have a Samsung TV for that to work, but it needs to have Wi-Fi connectivity and support Miracast.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android browser with Google Chrome also on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo comes with the stock Jelly Bean edition and Google Chrome. Both are very similar in terms of functionality, and Samsung will likely choose one over the other with a future OS update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsers support both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome has the added benefit of cross-platform sync capabilities that allow you to retrieve open tabs from desktop sessions, for instance, but doesn't have Labs support for test features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While it doesn't have all of the extra apps Samsung throws into their flagships, the Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo does have a few nifty applications that help it stand out from other smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator can translate between two languages using either typed text or speech recognition. It supports many widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Korean - and can read out the resulting translation too if you don't think your accent can cut it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner fills the role of your calendar app, and automatically syncs with Google Calendar based on the Google account you use in Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is unique to Samsung devices and offers all you need in a file explorer: multiple selection, cut, copy, paste, create folders, etc. This saves you the trouble of having to download a third-party file manager from the App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Grand Neo comes with Google Maps and Navigation. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Street view mode with digital compass enabled is an especially cool trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the best part of owning a smartphone is getting new apps, and the Grand Neo comes with two marketplaces right off the bat. From recommendations to top apps, the Google Play Store features a plethora of ways you can find new apps, and installing an app usually only takes a couple of taps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Apps features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find far fewer apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive apps to Galaxy owners, and you can find some apps that don't come preloaded on the device like the capable Polaris Office editor for documents.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo has an attractively large screen, which is a definite usability boost despite its relatively low resolution. Best of all, despite the big screen, it's still easy on the battery. Our proprietary battery life rating turned out above average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are already getting kind of tired of the same overused design language from Samsung, but at least this time around we get a matte back panel, which is a nice break from the shiny fingerprint magnets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera is actually OK in terms of quality, though the 720p video recordings are nothing to write home about. While, understandably, not all of the Samsung proprietary flagship software features are present in the entry-level device, Multi-view and Samsung Link, among others, were welcomes software additions you simply won't find from lesser manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Broadcom BCM23550 chipset used in the Galaxy Grand Neo is a good budget solution that happily takes on dual-core Cortex-A9 chips, but it is a bit behind its quad-core Cortex-A7 peers (with chips from other makers) when it comes to graphic-intensive apps such as games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Grand Neo finds itself in the rather precarious position of being a large-screened smartphone in a market segment that typically doesn't have such devices. Thanks to that and its new Neo branding, which Samsung will likely use on devices placed somewhere between the latest two generations of a particular lineup, it is actually quite uniquely positioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most obvious comparison, however, is with the original Samsung Galaxy Grand. With the exception of the processor, camera, and Jelly Bean build, the two devices are essentially identical. While the Neo does have a quad-core chipset, we found it to be faster in only half of the use cases. Furthermore, the downgrade of the Neo's camera in terms of raw megapixels and video recording is a disappointment. What's worse for the Neo is that currently, it's priced even slightly higher than the original Grand, putting it in a rather disadvantageous position.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Another big-screen alternative comes in the form of the Sony Xperia C. Its 5-inch display comes in at 540 x 960 pixels in resolution resulting in a higher pixel density, while the 8MP shooter is capable of 1080p video. Its quad-core MediaTek CPU outperforms the Grand Neo across the board, and there is also a larger battery. Unfortunately, the Xperia C isn't available in some markets, which could make it hard to come by at the same price you would get the Neo for.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Viable alternatives can also be found from some of the less popular manufacturers. The Huawei Ascend G700 sports a 5-inch display of 720p resolution, and even doubles up the RAM to 2GB. It uses the same quad-core 1.2GHz MediaTek chip as the Xperia C so it should handily outclass the Neo's Broadcom solution. The sub ?200 price point also helps its case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Grand S Flex is slightly more expensive than the G700, but throws LTE support into the mix, an upgraded camera, and double the internal memory. It only has a dual-core processor, but it's of the Snapdragon variety so it should still beat out the one on the Grand Neo.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Finally, the freshly-announced Galaxy Grand 2 is poised to be a much more worthy successor to the Galaxy Grand than the Neo. It's slightly larger but it's thinner. It's got a 5.25" 720p display and 1.5GB of RAM. It'll retain the Grand's 8MP 1080p-capable shooter, while bumping up the front-facer to 1.9MP. Oh, and did we mention the LTE support, 2,600 mAh battery, and the up-to-date Android 4.3 build? Obviously, the Grand 2 will run you more than the Grand Neo, coming in closer to ?300 (at the time of writing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Grand 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently priced around ?250 euro, the Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo is definitely a tough sale. It actually has a balanced feature mix but this sort of price puts it in some bad company - Samsung's own Grand and especially the Xperia C both match or improve many of its features, and both are priced lower than the Grand Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are after the extra large screen (with dual SIM support for good measure), the Galaxy Grand Neo would be a viable alternative only if it drops to a commitment-free price of around ?220 or lower. Until then, it would hardly make it further than a bench-warmer while other more sensibly-priced options will see plenty of action.</paragraph>
