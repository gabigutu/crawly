			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro will have to stand on its toes to be seen but it doesn?t have to yell to be heard. Small and boxy, this certainly is not just another mobile phone. The X10 mini pro will impress many with the degree of miniaturization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it?s not just a likeable chubby ? the X10 has the element of surprise on its side. It hides a capable keyboard behind its back and you wouldn't guess it's a full-featured smartphone from a first glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though there are so many Minis around ? and no less Pros ? the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro doesn?t risk getting lost in the crowd. Ironically, it?s the diminutive size that makes it prominent enough. A fact?s a fact: full-QWERTY smartphones just don?t get any smaller than that. By the way, did you notice that boxy and squarish messengers are on the rise lately? You can?t help it ? market trends call the shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Four of a kind is not bad at all for Sony Ericsson and their Android operation. They have a funny thing going on though. They just keep zooming out on the XPERIA X10. So is the next thing we?re likely to expect from them an X10 wristwatch?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X10 mini had to be as compact as possible and Sony Ericsson do deserve credit for keeping most of the functionality intact. A valuable feature was inevitably sacrificed though. Proper text input is all but essential in a modern smartphone and the XPERIA X10 mini pro is going to do something about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X10 mini pro has grown in all directions but it?s a matter of mere millimeters ? a negligible price for what you get. The extra space has also allowed Sony Ericsson to make the battery user-replaceable. Not that this was a critical flaw for the X10 mini but users were right to complain. It?s now been fixed in the pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did like the original Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini, and this was in no small part due to its cute smallness. The mini pro is perhaps even more impressive. If you?ve seen and held the X10 mini in your hand, the idea of a full QWERTY keyboard would?ve seemed less than brilliant. But Sony Ericsson did it and it looks like they did it right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us as we check the the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro ergonomics after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A reasonable retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro comes in a bigger box than the size of the phone itself suggests. Contents stick to the minimum ? just like it was with the regular X10 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a microUSB cable and a charger inside. The rest to find is a short manual and a 2GB microSD card that comes loaded in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The supplied headset is a standard issue Sony Ericsson MH610. The Hi-Fi MH810 variety with its custom jack developed specifically for X10 lineup is an optional accessory but we aren?t sure how many of the X10 mini pro users will be willing to spend extra on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no sign of the carrying case we saw in the XPERIA X10 mini retail package. There are no alternative battery covers either. But who know, this may be just ours.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>QWERTY-enabled handsets don?t really get any smaller than that. At 90 x 52 x 17 mm, the tiny Android will find room in any pocket even if it?s on the thicker side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset has a surprisingly good heft and balance at 120 grams. The mini messenger has grown in all directions compared to its QWERTY-less twin but a full keyboard that adds no more than a millimeter to the phone?s thickness is quite an achievement.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like its QWERTY-less sibling, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro is not the ultimate looker. Some might even find it slightly out-of-fashion. In any case the X10 mini pro has a certain charm if only because it?s not afraid to be different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do like the simple ? yet solid and gadgety ? feel of the phone: the soft rubbery back, the snappy flick of the slider and the surprisingly comfortable keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson X10 mini pro has a 2.55? QVGA touchscreen. And those of you who might question comfortable thumbing on a 2.55? diagonal ? just don?t worry. Sony Ericsson have done a good job optimizing the interface. They did have to sacrifice a bit of the functionality though, but it?s not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen sensitivity, as was to be expected in a capacitive unit, is excellent. The slightest of touches is enough for a click to be registered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is a very good reason why QVGA screens are a rarity in the Android world. The low resolution just doesn?t allow too fancy graphics that are an important part of the modern day smartphone experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 65K-color limitation inherent to Android versions prior to 2.0 could result in the occasional banding but it?s barely noticeable on a screen this size. We are not perfectly sure whether this will be resolved with an Android 2.1 update later this year, but hope dies last.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is passable as far as TFT displays go, with good brightness and above average contrast. The viewing angles are reasonable and, considering the hardware specs, the overall result is actually much better than we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility of the X10 mini display is hardly spectacular - but good enough. There is some loss of contrast but you are still able to operate the handset relatively trouble-free outdoors on a bright sunny day.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three hardware keys ? contextual menu, home and back button. Those are thin knobs but nicely raised and with good press feedback. A long press on the middle one brings up the task switcher in the Android tradition. There was no room for the Search button obviously but the search widget on the homescreen covers for that just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, we find a status LED, the earpiece and the proximity sensor. The proximity sensor is in charge of locking the display when you hold it next to your face during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro is where the microUSB port is located. The side-sliding QWERTY keyboard has caused the relocation of the microUSB connectivity port ? it used to be at the bottom of the regular XPERIA X10 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the X10 mini pro things have stayed the same: you get a volume rocker and a shutter key. Both of those controls are a on the slim side but you?ll get used to them eventually. The camera key has proper stroke and very distinct half pres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the handset is the screen lock key, which also acts as a power button. Being a bit too flat, it is hard to press but on the other hand, this helps avoid accidental presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the power/lock button is the peculiar audio jack of Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro. Designed to accommodate the Sony Ericsson MH810 headset and its unusual plug, the jack is still perfectly compatible with regular 3.5mm plugs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the X10 mini pro features the mouthpiece and the lanyard eyelet. It looks like left-handed users risk covering the mouthpiece with their fingers. We wouldn?t call it a design flaw, it?s just that the handset is so tiny that there aren?t too many ways to hold it comfortably during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro reveals the four-row QWERTY keyboard. If the size of the device made you worry that the keyboard won?t be too comfortable rest assured ? the X10 mini pro is a skillful texter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is enough space between the keys and the tactile feedback is good enough to provide for some fast typing. Of course there are quite a few mobiles out there that do even better in the QWERTY department but given its dimensions the X10 mini pro performs admirably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the XPERIA X10 mini pro features the 5 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash. The loudspeaker also goes in here, slightly to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the microSD card slot and the SIM compartment. The microSD slot is hot-swap enabled and, unlike the vanilla X10 mini, the pro-version has a removable battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This means that users can always carry a spare just in case and are also able to replace an expired or faulty battery without sending the handset to a Sony Ericsson service center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is said to last up to 285 hours of standby and 4 hours of talk time in a 2G network. In 3G mode, it?s up to 360 hours of standby and three and half hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those numbers are an exact match for the regular X10 mini battery specs so it?s hardly a surprise that the real-life performance of the two was quite similar as well. The X10 mini pro lasted just over three days of moderate use (about 15 minutes of telephony, 20 minutes of browsing over Wi-Fi, a dozen of photos and twenty minutes of fiddling with the other phone features a day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro is so small handling it feels somewhat strange ? unusual but by no means uncomfortable. It?s a tiny phone but the whole package just makes sense ? a cute little gadget that will do the job. And by the way, the QWERTY keyboard is surprisingly usable ? a great achievement considering the space they had to work with.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: going landscaping<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro currently runs Android 1.6 Cupcake, but Sony Ericsson is hard at work to bring 2.1 Eclair to it and the rest of the X10 lineup. To make up for the small screen, the interface has been duly scaled and the result is quite user-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>QVGA is as low as Android goes, but at 2.55? the pixel density isn?t that bad. It?s not the prettiest but Sony Ericsson have done a good job of customizing the interface and making the icons large enough, given the limited screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly, the UI on the X10 mini pro is identical to the one on X10 mini, save for one important difference ? some areas in the interface now work in landscape mode. This change was brought about by one of the key features of the X10 mini pro ? the QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have decided to spread things out rather than make them tiny ? the homescreen does widgets only (no shortcuts or folders) and you can only have one per screen. You can however have as many homescreen panes as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This setup is slower, but it's the optimal choice given the limited screen real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Large thumbable shortcuts at the four corners of the homescreen give instant access to the four most used features. By default those lead to the message composer, music player, phonebook and dial pad/call log but you can easily replace them if you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the notification area is still here ? we consider it to be one of the best features in Android. It's a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events. Sliding it down however reveals the whole story - you get a list of all recent notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X10 mini pro packs the Timescape UI plug-in but lacks the Mediascape that is only reserved for the full-grown X10 for now. Timescape is an application that brings all your communications together. It always displays an aggregated view of your SMS, MMS, email, missed calls, Facebook and Twitter updates all on one screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the task switcher on the X10 mini pro, you press and hold the Home key just like on any other Android phone. It gives you access to the six most recently used apps although, due to the specific behavior of the operating system, some of them might be hibernating rather than actually running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the actual performance is surely where the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro is nothing short of impressive. With a zippy 600MHz CPU and only a QVGA screen?s worth of pixels to push around, the thing is flying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can store quite a lot of information. It lets you input numbers for work and home, but this time there are no custom labels. There is of course an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add an IM nickname to the contact as well as a postal address, company and job title, several notes, you name it. Quite interesting is the option to redirect calls directly to voicemail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact, the various details are displayed in sections. Tapping on a given number dials the contact while opting for the envelope icon next to it launches the message editor. Those two buttons fill an entire horizontal row so that they are more thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is fine, but needs smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro had no issues with reception and in-call quality. The sound is loud and clear. There?s still a chance that you might cover the mic pinhole with your finger, so be careful with that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the XPERIA X10 mini pro, just like the rest of the Android crew (except for the likes of HTC Hero and Samsung Galaxy S) doesn?t feature smart dialing. Even when using the hardware keyboard, you can?t just type a name and dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the X10 mini pro the call log is a part of the dialer application. You can easily search the entries in it by flick scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro automatically switches off its touchscreen when you hold in next to your ear for a call. There is no chance of ever hitting an on-screen button with your cheek on this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro ? it scored a Good mark. It?s not the loudest we?ve heard, but we guess the small size of the phone limits the speaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: much better with QWERTY<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS department is quite straightforward - a new message button on top and a list of all your messages underneath, organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the newest message is placed at the bottom. At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key. There is a counter on the bottom right which is displayed once you have 16 or fewer characters remaining of the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can take a photo or record a video on the spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro has a virtual on-screen numpad, but for anything over three words you?d want to use the hardware QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding out the keyboard switches the UI orientation into landscape. A row at the bottom of the screen pops up ? it lets you switch the input language and shows the currently active keyboard modifier (lower/upper/auto case, alt key active or locked).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is slightly annoying as it wastes a row of the already limited screen space, but you can tap the X key to hide it. However, it shows up again when you continue typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For such a tiny phone, having 4 rows of decently spaced keys is a big thing. While texting, sending emails and IM messages was possible (if you really wanted) on the X10 mini, the X10 mini pro actually makes them a cinch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery does one-finger zoom, skimps on eye candy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro gallery automatically locates the images, no matter where they are stored. There is none of the cool new look of Android 2.1 Eclair ? you just get a plain grid with your images sorted by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just sweep to the left or right when looking at a photo fullscreen, and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch-zooming isn?t available but Sony Ericsson have come up with their own version of one-finger zoom that actually works great. You just hold your finger down and than sweep upwards for zooming in or downwards for zooming out. There?s also the double-tap zoom if that?s how you roll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there are no Bluetooth file transfers in the gallery or any other fancy functionality that more demanding users might expect. The X10 mini pro is a simple tool for previewing your images and it won?t do more than that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is pretty basic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is simple in looks and functionality. You get a list of all videos available on the phone and play/pause, skip controls, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MP4 files are as good as it gets. The petite Android cannot play DivX/XviD videos but even if you get a DivX player from the Market, it?s hardly worth the effort on the 2.55? screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is not very impressive either<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite a fresh redesign, the music player on the XPERIA X10 mini pro didn?t get much in terms of new features. It manages your audio files decently but there is very little extra functionality beyond that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best bit is the Infinite key that allows you to quickly look up a song or album on YouTube or Sony Ericsson?s own Play Now arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t even gradual typing for searching a specific song even with the QWERTY, so you will have to use the kinetic scrolling or opt for artist sorting. At least there are three smart playlists that automatically gather your Newly added, Most played and Never played tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still a lot of shortcomings of the music player that need addressing, though. For example there are still no equalizer presets, nor any alternative skins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station. Or you can mark some of them as favorite for easier scrolling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro performed pretty close but surprisingly not quite identical to its QWERTY-less sibling in our traditional audio quality test. It's either that Sony Ericsson had to use different hardware for some reason or they've tweaked the software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, the results are even better than the ones we saw from the the X10 mini with improved frequency response and intermodulation distortion. The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk have remained impressive too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The total harmonic distortion levels are pretty good and the volume levels are about average. In fact the X10 mini pro and the X10 mini are both louder in the headphones than the full-size XPERIA X10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixel camera is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the hardware side of things, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro has a 5 megapixel camera module for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels and a LED flash. It doesn?t sound like much but the size of the package says it all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is as simple as it gets with four buttons in total. There is a camera/camcorder switch, a gallery button, scene mode and flash settings. The four available scene presets include twilight, sports, landscape and, of course auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable geotagging, which is the most advanced feature available. You?ll have to go all the way to Settings / Sony Ericsson / Camera to find that option though, it?s not available in the camera app itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is certainly one of the most basic camera interfaces on the market but we guess Sony Ericsson thought users wouldn?t need much more and will prefer simplicity to functionality. In the end, it all comes down to the image quality, so let?s see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is pretty pleasing with a good (but not great) amount of resolved detail and the noise levels kept well under control, even in not so favorable lighting. The dynamic range on the other hand is somewhat low at times and the colors are a bit off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording on the X10 mini pro goes as high as VGA resolution which, needless to say, is far from impressive. At least the framerate is a good 30 fps and consistent enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the one on the still camera, except that there are even fewer settings. You can set the video quality, turn the video light on and off and that's that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are rendered in 3gp format suggesting lower bitrate, which in turn leads to some compression artifacts. Video also suffers from the lack of contrast so videos aren't too nice to watch on a computer screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is X10 mini pro sample video shot at VGA@30fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: all on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Mini does not refer to connectivity on the XPERIA X10 mini pro. For starters, you get quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for worldwide roaming and two versions with either dual-band (900/2100 MHz) or tri-band (850/1900/2100 MHz) 3G with HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to local connectivity, the X10 mini pro offers USB v2.0, Bluetooth v2.1 with A2DP support (no file transfer though) and Wi-Fi. The USB interface is standard microUSB and it can charge the phone over a USB connection to a computer. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card is accessible in mass storage mode or you can plug it into a card reader, which is the fastest way to do bulk data transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is let down by the small screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro is a very good one ? the major disadvantage is the lack of Flash support. This could change eventually, but the X10 mini pro will have to be updated to Android 2.2 Froyo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the limiting factor for web browsing here is the hardware, not the software ? the small, low-res screen doesn?t have much room for complex pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is rather minimalist ? all you get on the screen are the zoom controls. The address bar is hidden by default to save some space as the low resolution doesn?t allow too much content to fit on the screen anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Android browser on the X10 mini pro supports only a single zoom method ? the dedicated onscreen buttons. There is no double tap or one-finger zooming like in the Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the browser supports text reflow ? as soon as you zoom, columns of text adjust to fit the screen width. And there?s also the nice magnifying glass browsing mode, which let?s you browse the page quickly until you reach the part that you want to focus and then zoom in on to read it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and four keys pop up. You can open/switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, open bookmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash support is the other letdown of the X10 mini pro browser. There is of course a YouTube application onboard but Flash content doesn't start nor end with YouTube.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer does the job, no doc viewer isn?t a problem<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro came with no preinstalled document viewer so we had to snatch one off the Android Market. There is plenty of choice there so we don?t consider it too much of a disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you download an app it automatically integrates with the Gmail app as well, so you can view attachments. Unfortunately, you can?t save them in the phone memory (that only works for images). Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is to use the Preview option of Gmail, which renders the Office file (or PDF) into HTML which is then displayed on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has only two view modes - daily and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator, a timer and a stopwatch aboard. Those are all nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X10 mini pro features a decent alarm clock application, which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RoadSync applications, which also come preinstalled, use the Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync protocol to provide push synchronization of your emails, contacts and calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the YouTube app partially compensates for the web browser's lack of Flash support. Its interface is simple enough to let you find whatever you're looking for as quickly as possible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No surprise, the X10 mini pro comes with Google Maps out of the box. Multi-touch doesn't work so you?re stuck with the traditional zoom keys or double tapping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the screen activates a popup menu which ,among other things, can launch Street view. As usual, you can enjoy the 3D view of the area, which is controlled by sweep gestures with impressive fluidity. They can also make use of the built-in compass for an even better experience ? just hold the phone in your hand and turn around and Street view will follow you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re in one of the supported countries you could try Google Maps Navigation ? it should work on Android 1.6 Donut, even if some of the features from the Eclair version aren?t available (e.g. voice commands). Google Maps Navigation is the voice-prompt enabled version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other preinstalled map application is Wisepilot, which is found on other platforms. The thing about Wisepilot is that it requires a license for voice guided navigation and it downloads data over the Internet. That makes it unsuitable (or at least really expensive) for using abroad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are already several ways around that of course. The Android Market offers a dozen of applications (both free and paid) so it?s up to you to pick one that best suits you. The problem is that the screen and the phone itself seem too small to use for navigation but we guess everyone should judge that for themselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Shopping at the Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Market has grown a lot. It offers over 80,000 apps, the majority of which are free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some apps (like the official Twitter client) require Android 2.1, which leaves the XPERIA X10 mini pro out. For now, that is ? the Eclair update for the X10 family is coming up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Market organizes apps and games into two separate tabs, and each tab shows the best in the relevant category. The third tab keeps track of what you?ve already downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button, type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from pretty basic tools (such as the one that turns the display into a flashlight) to real must-have's (including file managers, navigation software and more), but that?s true for every other app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It sometimes makes sense to start big and go smaller. In all honesty, their top Android phone doesn?t quite stand up to the most recent competition. But since the original XPERIA X10, Sony Ericsson have been narrowing their focus ? trying to make a difference. And in the end, the X8 and the two mini droids may pay off better than the flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro is certainly not a phone without flaws, but it?s hard to stay mad at it for long. And that?s not just because we have a soft spot for it. It?s mostly because the handset does what it?s supposed to ? and does it well. No one promised you great movie watching, out-of-this-world imaging or a full office suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X10 mini pro is perhaps the smallest smartphone / QWERTY messenger ? but by no means a lesser smartphone package than most. If it wasn?t for the somewhat steep price it would be the easiest to recommend. Don?t forget though that the X10 mini pro has only been selling for a week or so. And the price will drop to more reasonable levels sooner rather than later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s now have a look around to see where possible competition might come from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course anyone who doesn?t do much texting should save themselves a few bucks and some pocket room and go for the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini. It?s the same package save for the physical keyboard. The X10 mini comes with a non-user-replaceable battery but that?s hardly a biggie. At the pace modern smartphones age, you are more likely to change your phone before you need to change its battery.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The FlipOut is Motorola?s take at a compact Android messenger. While we haven?t seen this one in flesh, the rest of the QWERTY-enabled Motorola droids have impressed us enough to be optimistic on this one.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you are willing to wander away from Android, the Nokia N97 mini is a larger but more capable QWERTY smartphone. However its usability is somewhat compromised by the unpolished S60 UI and it does take the mini tag far more lightly than the X10 mini pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N97 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vivaz Pro will give brand-loyal users a larger keyboard and a better camera for a few extra bucks. The thing is it comes with the pretty much the same S60 UI (though Sony Ericsson did get their own homescreen on top), which isn?t nowhere near as fluid as Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Vivaz Pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upcoming Nokia X5-01 merits an honorable mention. If a boxy smart messenger is an absolute must, do give it a look when it hits the shelves in the following months. You will get a 5 megapixel shooter and a QVGA screen but will have to live without a touch UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia X5-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So as you can see even if alternatives do exist, none of them is able to perfectly match the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro spec-by-spec. It?s always good to first make up your mind about what you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, we?ll say it again ? everyone needs a phone. Few people need a smartphone. Fewer yet need a smart messenger. Now, what does that leave pint-sized smart messengers? It doesn?t look good. But we know what does. A Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini pro.</paragraph>
