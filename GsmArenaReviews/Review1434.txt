			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia World 2010 has already started and we are reporting live from the event. We will be publishing the live photos and videos of the newly announced devices in this article along with our first impressions so make sure to keep an eye on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year's Nokia World 2010 started a few hours ago. Here's a video from the grand opening:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official announcements of the Nokia new business flagship - E7 and the mid-range touch-driven Nokia C7 and NokiaC6-01. All three new devices run on the Symbian^3 OS so unless we see another announcement tomorrow MeeGo fans will leave London disappointed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the Nokia Executive Vice President in charge of Nokia's Mobile Solutions Anssi Vanjoki put it the new OS keeps the familiar interface but performs a lot better and adds plenty of new features. Well we will see about that soon, after we spend some quality time with each of the new phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh and we'll have a chance to check out that N8 monster of a cameraphone so there's every reason for you to stay tuned. The first portion of live images follows after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E7 has a tilting 4" AMOLED touchscreen with nHD resolution and a four row slide-out QWERTY keyboard. It's got high-end connectivity - 10.2Mbps HSDPA, 2Mbps HSUPA, Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 3.0, A-GPS and Cell-ID positioning along with USB On-The-Go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E7 highlights list continue with an 8MP camera with dual-LED flash, 720p video capture, and 16GB of built-in storage. Unfortunately though, it turned out that the promising shooter is lacking autofocus, which takes some of the fun out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's HDMI port with Dolby Digital Plus surround sound support. The Nokia E7 weighs a hefty 176 grams - but that's because it's made of anodized aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E7 display uses the new ClearBlack technology, which promises darker blacks, better sunlight legibility and lower power usage. The E7 is expected to cost around 495 euro (637 USD) before taxes and subsidies.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E7 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having already spend some time with the E7 we can easily agree with the description of Anssi Vanjoki - this thing is BIG. But luckily those bits about its great build quality and sleek design turned out true, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, here's a hands-on video of the Nokia E7 that we shot at the event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E7 is certainly not easy to handle if you have smaller hands but it certainly is great to look at. The keyboard feels very comfortable as one would expect from a device that claims to succeed the omnipresent Nokia E90 communicator. Just how can the successor sport a resolution lower than its predecessor is a whole different question, which we can't answer at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolution aside, the Nokia E7 Clear Black display does look pretty good. Its viewing angles are comparable, although not quite as good as the ones on the iPhone 4. The typically high for AMOLED screen contrast makes everything go live on the screen and the display doesn't seem to have too many reflections, which suggests that it will be easily visible under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a quick thought about the user interface. It does seem to do everything they promised at the announcement - fix most Symbian^1 flaws, but retain the same structure. Now depending on how you look at it that second part could either be good news or bad news but we would rather stay positive at this stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all Symbian is still the most popular smartphone platform out there so people are quite used to it. And that means they will be able to find their way around the Symbian^3 OS quite easily too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next, we're moving on to the Nokia C7 - this stainless steel beauty is just 10.5 mm thin. It has an 8MP camera with dual-LED flash and 720p video, and the same excellent connectivity features as the E7, except the HDMI - it relies on the more traditional composite video-out instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 has a 3.5" AMOLED screen with nHD resolution and 8GB of built-in memory. But unlike the E7, the C7 memory is expandable through the microSD card slot. The Nokia C7 is expected to cost 335 euro (430 US dollars).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C7 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 may not be able to outdo the E7 but it is destined to sit on top of the Nokia most popular (in terms of sales at least) series. Symbian^3 and the larger screen alone should be enough to make C7 undisputed leader there but the top of the Cseries is already well above the entry-level territory so it will face tough competition from outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weather or not the Nokia C7 will be up for the challenge is a bit hard to say at this point. Sure the device is nicely slim and feels great to handle. Metal is used a lot for its body and that gives it the solid feel that we appreciate so much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is also there so it won't be annoying in normal day to day use and the connectivity options are more than adequate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet Symbian has earned itself quite bad reputation as a touch-driven OS so we are not sure that the pricing is properly chosen. People will need more persuasion to buy a Symbian device now than they did a couple of years ago and we somehow don't see the C7 as a package as attractive as the other two devices announced today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But then again it's way too early to judge now as we need to spend far more time with the device before we confirm or deny those speculations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a hands-on video of the Nokia C7:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to get our hands on several samples from the Nokia C7 camera. Unfortunately the photos are taken with a 16:9 aspect ratio, which may fit the screen perfectly but doesn't make use of all the sensors so they come in 6MP resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those photos have plenty of fine detail indicating that the Nokia C7 packs fine optics. The noise is also rather low so the potential seem to be all there. However, understandably at this stage of the development of the handset, the image processing still needs some tuning. Still even at this stage most of the images look pretty well and while we can't say anything about the shooting conditions this is still encouraging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the E7 however, Nokia C7 lacks autofocus and relies on the so-called full-focus (or extended depth of field) instead. Yet this doesn't allow photographing objects that a less than a meter away from the camera so it's by far not the real thing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C6-01<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last of the three newly announced phones is the Nokia C6-01 (not to be confused with the C6-00). It's shorter than the C7 - 103.8mm vs. 117.3 mm. The screen size has been reduced - 3.2" AMOLED touchscreen with nHD resolution using the same ClearBlack technology as the E7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 boasts the same camera and connectivity features as the C7 (sans TV-out) and its 8GB built-in memory is extended by a 2GB microSD card in the box. It too has a stainless steel body though it's quite a bit thicker than the C7 - 13.9 mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 is the cheapest of the bunch, it is expected to cost 260 euro (334 USD).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C6-01 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia C6-01 certainly isn't the most interesting of the bunch announced today but from where we stand it might be the one with the best prospects on the market. Bringing the nicely looking 3.2" ClearBlack AMOLED screen at a lower price is a feat that might make quite a lot of people consider it when picking their next phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the contrasty display (which is also smaller so the nHD resolution looks perfectly acceptable) isn't the only thing that C6-01 puts to the table. We are huge fans on the extensive usage of metal for its body, which is not something we often see in this price range. And the fact that recycled materials have been used will be music to the environmentalists' hearts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, and probably most important, the Nokia C6-01 brings a performance identical to the more expensive C7 and even the E7. Symbian might not be the flashiest OS out there but it is certainly one of the most functional and now that its latest ^3 reincarnation addresses most of the user-friendliness issues things start to look better and better for the C6-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out our Nokia C6-01 brief demo video:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N8 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the other handsets we met so far the Nokia N8 wasn't announced now. However it is still not available on the market so paying its corner a visit was the only chance to get to see it in flesh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metallic unibody of the handset grabs your attention straight away and it feels so good to touch that you wouldn't want to let go of it. Okay that might be taking things a little too far but the N8 is one sleek device indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are even willing to live with the fact that the Nokia N8 battery isn't user replaceable (as long as that 1200 mAh unit doesn't turn out completely inadequate) if that was what it took to achieve the excellent build quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the large image sensor that Nokia stuffed into the N8 took its toll on the device waistline and it isn't as slim as most of its competitors. Yet the camera is certainly the handset's key feature and seeing its output we cannot help but feel that the few millimeters of added thickness were well worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus the N8 brings the same S^3 goodies as the E7, C6-01 and C7. That means that both user friendliness and performance are better than in previous Nokia touch-driven Symbian smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again we are giving you a short demo video so you can see what the N8 real life performance is like.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N8 vs Samsung M8910 Pixon12 shootout<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We conducted a brief shootout between the Nokia N8 and the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 to see how far Nokia has gone with their N8 12 megapixel flagship cameraphone. The Samsung Pixon12 is currently on top of the cameraphone food chain so naturally we had one handy on site to do some comparative head-to-head shooting with the Nokia N8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turns out the two cameras had quite different approach to shooting in the low-light conditions we had to work in. The Pixon12 chose to keep the ISO low minimising noise levels, but that resulted in a massive speed drop to about 1/15. Normally that would make clear, blur-free hand-held shots almost impossible. We used a tripod for this test so that's a bit of an unfair advantage for the Pixon12.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even so the Nokia N8 produced sharper, more detailed images even though it has a wider viewing angle so it fits more stuff onto its 12 megapixel sensor. It's also got some livelier color output. It didn't however manage to impress with low noise levels as much as we hoped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also noticed that the Samsung M8910 Pixon12 images suffer from barrel distortion noticeably more than the Nokia N8 shots. Kudos to Nokia for achieving this, despite having to work with wider-angle lens (28mm vs 30mm on the Pixon12).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still this test is far from scientific and we will have to wait until we get to spend more time with an N8 before we pass a final judgment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N8 vs Apple iPhone 4 video shootout<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since the Pixon12 is unable to record HD video we installed the iPhone 4 as a Nokia N8 competitor in the video recording department. Check out how those two compare:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N8 camera samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia put a lot of eggs in the camera basket with the N8 and they are really keen to prove that all the hype is worth it (and hopefully generate even more hype). What we have for you here is a boatload of sample images that Nokia say come straight from the N8 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To call them impressive will be a vast understatement? you know what, we won't try to comment on each one of them. Just check them out for yourselves. It's quite obvious that a LOT of hard work and preparation has gone into making such nice shots and what we are looking here is the N8 at its best. In your regular day-to-day usage you will hardly achieve the same level of results but it's good to know that you could if you wanted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it's time for the show to begin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find even more samples in our blog.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>When we reviewed the Nokia 6700 classic we loved it - the smooth metal body gave the phone an amazing feel. That's why we were really excited when we got our hands on the new Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here's a hands-on video to give you a better feel for the Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has the same finish as the 6700 classic, the back cover is especially reminiscent of what we dubbed "Sirocco Lite". It's a whisker slimmer than 6700 classic too - just 11mm thick. And it's lighter too - 100 g - but it's just enough to give it a pleasant heft.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Series 40 devices rarely had exciting specs but the Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type chock full of them. It's not just the touchscreen, which will aid navigation quite a bit, but won't do much for the ease of text input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 has got dual-band 3G with HSPA for speeds up to 10.2Mbps and Wi-Fi b/g/n so it will be a while before the Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type gets outdated in terms of connectivity. The camera is the same as the one on the E5 - 5MP, fixed focus, with LED flash and VGA@15fps video recording. Fixed focus? Perhaps this is where they lost us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook and Twitter integration is welcome, but it may put a strain on the keypad.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3-02 Touch and Type which was unveiled a month ago is company's first handset to pack a touchscreen and a regular alphanumeric keypad simultaneously. It is also the first S40 touch-driven device to get a global release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite its low standing in the food chain, the Nokia X3-02 packs excellent connectivity with WLAN (including the new N standard), 3G with HSPA, Bluetooth and microUSB all on board. The music fans will also appreciate the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3-02 touchscreen measures 2.4" in diagonal and sports QVGA resolution. This is one of the smallest touchscreens on the market so we really hope that Nokia did a good job of optimizing the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final noteworthy feature of the 9.6mm slim device is its 5 megapixel fixed-focus camera that is also capable of recording video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia X3-02 should hit the shelves by the end of the month in White Silver, Dark Metal, Petrol Blue, Pink and Lilac color versions. Its estimated retail price is 125 euro before taxes or subsides.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia X3-02 Touch and Type hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After spending a few minutes with the X3-02 Touch and Type we can finally share with you our first impressions of the device. Before we go on, we should first note that the thing looks as nice in reality as on those official images posted above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing you'll notice once you touch the device is the missing navigation buttons. There is no D-pad, soft keys or whatsoever. And this is where the touchscreen comes in handy. With its help you can easily browse the menu, the image gallery, you name it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen feels responsive enough and the image quality is fine too. The interface is responsive too with rare occasional lags. It's well touch optimized, with large on-screen buttons and well thought menu structure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X3-02 Touch and Type feels nice when held in hand. You may need a little while to get used to it but once you're done with that there, should be no issues with the phone's ergonomics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thin body and the great built quality are just another plus.</paragraph>
