			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many thought the days of BlackBerry were numbered yet the company is still here, pushing new phones. The Canadians might not be the leading smartphone manufacturer that it once was, but it's still got a loyal fanbase that the BlackBerry Leap comes to cater to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a 5" HD display, dual-core processor, 2GB RAM, an 8MP shooter and a rich connectivity package - not the kind of specs to make a geek's pulse race, but adequate for the mid-range that the Leap is targeting. The design is instantly recognizable - square edges, plastic unibody and dotted rear panel with a huge BlackBerry logo. It's more of the classic kind, rather than modern or fresh, but that's a good thing to say for a business-oriented phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap is hardly a hero device set to lift the profile of the company - instead it's a workhorse that should bring in some extra sales and help keep the maker afloat until it figures out its next strategic move. And on paper it looks capable of handling the task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course we shouldn't forget that competition in the mid-range has never been this fierce. What was once a land of underperforming handsets trying to replicate flagships designs with cheaper materials and often failing spectacularly now hosts a bunch of very solid smartphones that can cater to the needs of many a power user. The Leap needs to convince us it's got what it takes to compete there, offering enough standout features to attract attention and a well-balanced experience to make customers reach for their wallets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's see how this one goes - we start with the unboxing and hardware inspection after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the BlackBerry Leap<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing out of the ordinary within the BlackBerry Leap retail box - there is a 1.3A charger, a microUSB cable and a pair of headphones. That's it - no additional accessories like travel adaptors or leather pouches, but we no longer expect to find such goodies anyway - even flagship go as basic as possible these days.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Leap 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Leap spreads at 144 x 72.8 x 9.5 mm and tips the scales at the rather heavy 170g. The bezels around the 5" display are slightly above average and you can definitely feel the heft of the phone that contributes to the solid in-hand feel but also makes it slightly uncomfortable in some pockets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison to the 4.2" BlackBerry Z10, the Leap is 14mm taller, 7mm wider and about 33g heavier. All notable differences, but not ones that couldn't be expected given the bump in screen size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap has a classic design that will certainly find its set of fans. It isn't going to be everyone's favorite due to its slightly conservative nature, but it won't completely disappoint many people either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Better yet, the industrial design with square edges, thick plastic and dotted matte finish is instantly recognizable in the crowd of mid-rangers and that's an achievement of its own. The Leap isn't going to be a conversation starter when you are with your friends, but it's classy enough to let you put on the table in front of your business partners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap's unibody shell is made out entirely of thick matte plastic - either black or white, depending on your preferences. Glossy plastic is there but it has been used sparingly - only for the four control keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a nice side effect to that, BlackBerry Leap isn't prone to fingerprints and smudges, no matter which color you opt for. The screen's protective glass is easier to mess up as is the norm, but it's very easy to clean, so that base is covered too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap feels great in the hand - it has excellent build and the body feels perfectly solid. The Leap is slightly too big to be operated with just one hand all the time, but it's still possible in many cases, once you get used to the cool gestures Blackberry's built in its operating system.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap has a rather standard placement of controls. Above the screen we find the earpiece flanked by the 2MP front snapper and a couple of sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Leap has three separate keys - the volume controls and the centered Voice Assistant hotkey.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a huge plastic cap on the right, which gives access to the hot-swappable microSD and microSIM slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the BlackBerry Leap houses the 3.5mm audio jack, the Power/Lock key and the secondary microphone. Note that the display can be unlocked by a gesture, so we can live with the uncomfortable placement of the power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the BlackBerry Leap is where the microUSB port and the primary microphone are. There are lots of regulatory inscriptions around as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera and the LED flash are at the back, placed on a thin piece of glass. The loudspeaker grille is in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Leap boasts a 5.0" LCD screen of 720p resolution (720 x 1280 pixels). It's a regular LCD unit, as the company obviously felt IPS was out of budget. The pixel density clocks in at 294 ppi, which is way below what this season's flagships offer - but, admittedly, crisp enough for comfortable reading and viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transition from AMOLED and IPS screens to regular LCD panels has cost the BlackBerry Leap somewhat in terms of contrast, but it manages to keep it over the high notes. The colors are still pretty great, but the viewing angles took a major hit - colors get washed and distorted once you start looking the screen at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is average, as testified by the BlackBerry Leap's performance in our dedicated test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Leap does auto-brightness correction all the time and there is no option to turn it off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap packs a non-removable 2,800 mAh battery of the Li-Ion kind. According to the official specs it should be enough for up to 25 hours of mixed use, 12 hours on talks or two weeks on standby. BlackBerry even promised it will be enough for 9.5 hours of video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did our traditional battery test and we found the BlackBerry Leap to be behind the curve. It achieved and endurance rating of 45 hours, which means you can rely on it for two full days if you use the Leap for an hour of 3G calls, video playback and web browsing each day. Its standby performance is really poor and that's affecting the total performance a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 10.3.1 introduces a Battery Saving Mode, which allows you to optimize your daily usage even better. You can configure it to limit the CPU performance, location and data services, notifications, and brightness, and advanced gestures. The Battery Saving mode can be either activated manually, or set to turn on automatically at certain battery level. Using the Battery Saving mode may boost your battery life so we recommend trying it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap has all your basic connectivity needs covered. It's an LTE-capable smartphone, with maximum speeds under Category 3 standard - up to 100Mbps for download and up to 50Mbps for upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone has Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n only in the 2.4GHz spectrum, but does have Miracast and hotspot support. Bluetooth is the 4.0 iteration, with A2DP enabled for audio streaming. There's no NFC, but there is an FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's GPS with A-GPS support, but no GLONASS positioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB syncing with a PC and data transfers, but no USB OTG. A standard 3.5mm jack completes the wired connectivity package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 10.3.1 is heavy on the gestures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry 10 has been around for quite some time now, having debuted on the Z10 and Q10 early last year. With the last major 10.3 update, the company further polished its design bringing more colorful menus and minimalist icons and added a digital personal assistant, dubbed BlackBerry Assistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the minor 10.3.1 release lets you create customized notification profiles and brings a battery saving mode. It brings the option to hide pictures and videos from the gallery, improves on the BlackBerry Assistant, notification LED management and overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The swipe-driven navigation makes the BB10 OS unique, featuring some niceties from WebOS and Meego, and quite different from the established platforms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That being said, BlackBerry 10.3.1 does have support for Android applications (API 18, Jelly Bean 4.3 compatibility), which is a plus. Unfortunately, there is no Google Play Store pre-installed, but you do get the Amazon AppStore and the option to manual side-load APK files. We even managed to side-load the Play Store itself, but it should be pointed out that some apps refused to install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Leap greets you with a standard swipe-to-unlock lockscreen. New messages and notifications will show up here, and you can expand them to see what they say directly on the homescreen. You can use the Power/Lock button to unlock the device. A swipe up from the bottom of the screen will unlock the phone even if the screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a shortcut to the camera in the bottom right, and you can pull down a bedside clock from the top. This latter feature will also disable notification alerts, and is useful for when you don't want to be disturbed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On to the BlackBerry 10.3.1 homescreens, which haven't changed from previous iterations of the OS. There are multiple panes, two of which have a special purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer takes up most of the homescreen panes - it's a paged grid of icons for all installed apps. A long press on an icon starts edit mode, which lets you rearrange icons and uninstall apps with a single tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To the left of your app drawer panes, there's a special "active frames" homescreen that shows thumbnails of all your open apps. To minimize an app, simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all active frames are a downsized screenshot of the app, some switch to something more informative. For example, the Phone app switches to a list of recent calls, which is big enough to read comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frames are arranged chronologically and have a small X button to exit when you don't need them any longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One more homescreen to the left and you're taken to BlackBerry Hub. Hub is where you see all of your notifications and messages. Whether it be BBM, text message, or email, you'll find it here. Here you'll also see notifications from applications, calendar alerts, and anything else the Leap has to tell you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also access the Hub from anywhere by simply swiping up from the bottom (like you would to minimize an app), and to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can quickly go back and forth between homescreens by swiping across the small indicator icons below the homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry has added an Android-like swipe-from-the-top gesture that'll let you access a variety of quick toggles. You can tap to toggle settings like WiFi, Bluetooth and Airplane mode. Holding down on a toggle will take you to the relevant settings option. Unlike Android, however, there are no notifications to be found in this menu - they're all on the Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're inside an app, however, a swipe-from-the-top gesture will bring out app options instead. To access the toggles menu, use a two finger swipe instead. This change of functionality of the swipes is rather confusing and definitely takes some getting used to, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not the only place where the BlackBerry OS offers gestures that aren't particularly intuitive. The good news is that the OS does a good job of popping up small tutorial dialogues that give you hints when you need them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hype around virtual assistants has certainly dropped over the past year, but they are still improving. You can ask BlackBerry's Assistant to call someone, send them an email, text or BBM, schedule an appointment or make a note. Other options include searching the phone or the Internet, posting updates to your social networking accounts - Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn are all supported.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Leap runs on the very dated but popular in its familiy Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Play MSM8960 chipset with a 1.5GHz dual-core Scorpion CPU, Adreno 225 GPU, and 2GB of RAM. Qualcomm took the wraps off the MSM8960 in the distant 2011 - the year BlackBerry Bold 9900 launched, so don't expect any miracles from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the BlackBerry Leap through the paces of several hardware benchmarks, compatible with the Android API. Unsurprisingly, the results came out pedestrian by today's standards. See for yourself below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing benchmarks test JavaScript and HTML5 performance. The scores of BlackBerry Leap were once again far from impressive. We tried installing Google Chrome, but it was incompatible with the Leap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see above, BlackBerry Classic is hardly a device to smash through benchmarks with. Its real life performance isn't perfect either. While the QNX-based BlackBerry OS 10.3.1 is smooth and responsive, we witnessed some lag and way too long loading times on some apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also worth pointing out that the smartphone slows down when running some of today's popular Android apps, so don't expect the same performance as when those run natively.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer has three tabs - Calls, Contacts and Dial pad. Unfortunately you can't swipe between those three (rather confusing, given that you can swipe between tabs elsewhere in the UI).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log features three shortcuts on top - Voice Mail plus three contact numbers. You can add more quick-dial numbers here, but the more you add, the further down the actual call log gets pushed. The call log itself can display either all calls or missed calls only (there's a toggle).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook looks a lot like the Contacts tab of the phone app, it also has a search field and it is also automatically activates when you start typing with the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Leap's single speaker provides stellar quality sound at high levels. It doesn't quite match the performance of the BlackBerry Passport and its stereo speakers, but it surely won't leave you disappointed either. The Leap got a Very Good score for loudness too, so you won't be missing important stuff even in the noisiest environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Hub is a great messaging tool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry phones were the gold standard for business users and the robust messaging support has carried over to BlackBerry 10. BlackBerry Hub is about as comprehensive a messaging platform as you'll find on a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hub is simple - a list of messages with an icon that indicates the service (SMS, BBM, email, Twitter or Facebook, but also calls and voicemails) and also flags messages read or unread (color icons are for unread messages, monochrome icons are for read messages). Messages are indexed by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the list of messages is too much of a mess, there's Search or you can swipe right to reveal a list of all services that feed messages into the Hub. You can then filter messages by service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe down (not from the top) to show your agenda, and sort the Hub via the left contextual menu. The right contextual menu gives you more options, including a settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Replying to a message is easy, and you don't have to use multiple apps for multiple messaging types. Simply start replying or composing and the Hub will take care of the rest, be it SMS, email or social network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also select multiple messages and there are handy quick actions that let you do a wide variety of things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message management skills of the Hub don't end there - a long press on a message brings out a long list of options on the right. You can "drag" a message to one of these options in the same gesture or lift your finger and tap the option you like, whatever seems easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Texting and BBM<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messaging is handled by the BlackBerry Hub. The Text Messages shortcut in the app drawer just leads to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is no different than on other OSes. Multimedia and other data (contact info, appointment even generic files) can be attached to the message, turning it into MMS. There's an option to attach a location (either your current location or point on a map) to the message, which is great for giving directions. More than one item can be attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Messenger is one of the hottest features on BB phones. At the base level, BBM can do text and voice chats (over your mobile data connection or Wi-Fi). BBM is now free and also supports users on iOS and Android, which boosts its usefulness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also BBM Video - video calling with a twist. Instead of being able to show footage only from the front-facing camera, the phone lets you screen-share. This way the other party sees just what you see - a great way to show someone how to do something, walk them through a document or anything else you can think of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Channels feature lets you browse through a wide range of channels to find other BBM users that share similar interests. As of the BlackBerry 10.3 update, there's also support for custom sticker purchases in BBM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email accounts are accessed through the BlackBerry Hub. You can add as many as you like, and emails received to each account will show up in the Hub.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery, dubbed Pictures, has a simple interface. You can sort by date or albums, and images will appear in a non-zoomable thumbnail interface. Using the slider on the right will pop up a small image preview in the center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple images can be selected for deleting and sharing. There are also options to edit the image, start a slideshow or use DLNA to push images to a compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing individual images gives you the same options. The Edit option in the gallery app is pretty powerful. The Transform tab in the editor can rotate and flip the image and there's a free transform tool as well if you want to crop out a specific part of the image. Then there's Enhance with the standard image tweaking options available (brightness, contrast, sharpness, noise reduction) as well as a selection of filters.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a very similar interface to that of the image gallery. It can sort by date, library, or favorites, and can display items either as a list or in a grid. You can search for a video, mass delete videos, share them or push them through DLNA to a compatible player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player handled all the popular file formats easily, with the often met exception of videos with AC3 audio. There was even support for MOV files, and subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that impressed us was the Edit option - it took a 1080p video and offered to trim its start and end points, rotate and crop the video, adjust its brightness, contrast color and sound too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an additional Story Maker app lets you pick multiple movies and photos and puts together a video slideshow with a soundtrack of your choice. There are several different preset styles, which add an effect over the entire video (vintage, bleach pass, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go back and add/remove items, rearrange them and put them through the image or video editor if they need to be tweaked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, Story Maker saves the resulting videos in 720p resolution. You can switch to 1080p if you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Music player has the FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player's UI is pretty similar to the image gallery and video player in how it handles files. The music library can sorted by Artist, Album or Genre and a dedicated tab displays all the playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface is pretty simple with prominent album art in the middle, surrounded by playback controls (including shuffle and repeat buttons). If you tap on the album art (or drag it down) you get the current playlist so you can easily jump between songs (swiping left and right to skip tracks doesn't work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no playback controls on the lockscreen or the shade on top of the screen, so you'll have to use the volume keys instead. The volume up and down buttons change the volume for short presses or act as skip buttons when long-pressed. The middle button is play/pause.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is DLNA-enabled, just like the gallery and video players. There is also equalizer support. But you'll have to use one of the available presets as there's no custom equalizer option available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can access the FM radio through the side menu of the Music player. It's pretty much standard affair - you can favorite stations, play through the loudspeaker and supports RDS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap delivers in the audio quality department. It?s not the loudest smartphone around, but the clarity of its output is near perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When hooked to an active external amplifier the Leap showed flawlessly clean output, posting great scores top to bottom. Volume levels were below average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones and you get a very small amount of extra stereo crosstalk, with the other readings remain just as good. Volume levels are still somewhat disappointing, but if you don't have very high-resistance headphones, you'll be perfectly pleased with this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap comes with an 8MP main camera and LED flash alongside a secondary 2MP camera. That's no longer an impressive number, but BlackBerry managed to squeeze quite a lot of performance out of its dated sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is straightforward and doesn't have too many options, but all the important stuff is there. There's a handful of scenes and four shooting modes: normal, Time Shift, Burst, and Panorama.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the Leap shoots 16:9 images. If you want to get the full resolution though you need to switch to 4:3 to get 3264 x 2448px images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's touch focus on board, and a digital zoom is available through pinch zooming. A nifty trick is swiping the gallery thumbnail in the lower left, which brings up a quick preview of your last shot taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap's camera resolves plenty of detail, making the photos sharp even at pixel level. Even with the relatively low resolution this easily captures more detail than some 13MP and 16MP snappers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are pretty goodtoo, if slightly oversaturated and going for a puinchier look. Dynamic range is wide, but contrast still remains decent, while noise is kept under control, making up for pretty good images overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR photos turn out okay but they take quite a while to process. BlackBerry Leap manages recover some lost highlights and shadows and while it does produce a somewhat unrealistic image it's nothing too drastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a panorama shooting mode that does very well too with no visible problems in stitching or combining the images. You'll want to shoot in Portrait mode for the maximum resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see how the camera stacks up to other 8MP shooters we've tested using out dedicated Photo Compare tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   BlackBerry Leap in our Photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera with 1080p@30fps recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Recording video is done from the same interface as the still camera. Video recording defaults to 1080p@30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During recording, you can move the focus point around (again by dragging not tapping) and you can toggle the video light on and off. There's no way to capture stills while video recording though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p videos are stored in MP4 files with 16Mbps total bitrate. The sound is recorded in stereo and uses a 192Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is support for 720p at 60 fps video recording. The bitrate is at about 12Mbps, while the audio is kept the same high quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, you the same result as the still images - great amount of details, unrealistic colors sometimes, accurate colors and exposure. The dynamic range could have been better sometimes, but we can't complain of the results. The low-light videos, as you can check over the comparison tools below, lose the "punchy colors" and provide spot on white balance and colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download a 9s 1080p @ 30fps video sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can watch a longer one over YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see how the BlackBerry Leaps shooter compares to other 1080p camcorders we've tested using our dedicated Video Compare tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Leap has a WebKit-based browser that is easy to operate thanks to the square screen and hardware buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is straightforward. The first thing you see is the New tab interface, which shows thumbnails of recently visited sites. You can remove any visited sites from this interface or from your history, of course. There is also an incognito mode, named Private browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering URLs is quick thanks to the autocomplete feature, which managed to guess correctly what we're trying to type most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the poor browsing benchmarks results, the browser is fast and elaborate - web sites are rendered without a hitch. Pinch zooming is smooth and there's double-tap to zoom too, but no text reflow. From the Menu button you get access to several more options, including Find on page and Share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool option has the browser remember which tabs were open, so the tabs will still be there even if you close the browser and open it again later (similar to recent desktop browsers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting option is Reader - it strips out the site's interface and leaves only the content, making it much easier to read on a phone's screen. It doesn't work very well with multi-page articles though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Leap comes with a full-blown Office document editor. It's called DocsToGo and can both view and create Word and Excel documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint presentations can be edited too, but only for small tweaks - you can't create new presentations from scratch or even add new slides. The Present option is pretty sweet though - it displays the slide through HDMI to the TV/projector, while showing you the notes for the slide on the phone's screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Word editor has all the text formatting features you'll need - everything from the standard bold, italic, underline through text justification, text and background color, font and text size, super and sub scripts, to list and paragraph styling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel editor works with multiple sheets, cell formatting and formulas, though we would have appreciated a formula wizard of some sort. We're no Excel experts so typing out the formulas by hand from memory was a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File Manager is here for more advanced file handling. It shows the internal and external storage as either a grid or list of files and folders. You can sort them by name, date, type and size in either ascending or descending order and if you still can't find what you need, there's the search feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files and folders can be moved, copied and deleted in bulk, renamed or even zipped up into a single file and then unzipped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is cloud-enabled too - you can add Box and Dropbox accounts. They are treated almost the same way as a microSD card, so copying files between phone and cloud storage is seamless. There's no search option here (but you can still sort folders).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar has an updated interface with daily, monthly, and weekly views. There's also an agenda view for viewing all your appointments in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple calendars are supported and they are color coded, so you can easily tell where which event comes from (e.g. your personal Gmail account or the work calendar).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app features the same clock as the Bedside mode on the lockscreen. You can switch to a digital watch face if you prefer. You also get alarm functionality, a world clock, stopwatch, and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a standard Calculator app with expandable advanced functions, as well as a very nifty tip calculating tool and a converter for all sorts of measurements. There's also an animated Compass that can tell you your exact coordinates via GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry 10 comes with its own Maps application which only features regular mapping - no satellite images or street view. It can show traffic information, but there's no public transport or pedestrian navigation support. The POI database isn't nearly as rich as that of Google Maps, but at least maps now load quicker than they did on previous BB 10 phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add favorite places (Home and Work get special treatment) to find your way faster. If a contact from your address book has location info, you can quickly navigate to them too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps application has voice-guided navigation for in-car use. It's online-only (that is you need an Internet connection for it to work). You can tweak the route finding algorithm by telling it to look for the Fastest, Simplest or Shortest routes and to avoid highways, toll roads, carpool lanes or ferries. Night mode can be enabled, disabled or set to activate automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry World is the place to get new apps for your BlackBerry Leap. While not as many apps as Android and iOS have (or even Windows Phone), many of the major names are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BB World is not too different from the Google Play Store. It shows featured apps on top of the screen, then vertical categories including utilities, trending apps, top grossing apps, and more. Before an app installs, you'll be prompted to allow the app's required permissions. It's a bit annoying that you only get to see those after the app has been downloaded (but before it's installed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned that in the beginning of the year the BlackBerry World opened business with a respectable number of apps for a new app store, but a good 40% of those apps are Android ports (BlackBerry handed $100 to developers who ported their Android app to World).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, as of BlackBerry OS 10.3, there's runtime support for Android 4.3 apps. This enables hardware acceleration, which in theory at least, boosts performance of ported Android apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all apps work as advertised, however. We've tried side-loading a few Android apps and we also downloaded a few from the Amazon Appstore, which was preinstalled on the device. Not all of the apps started and the ones we sideloaded didn't match the device's square screen. The ones we downloaded from the Amazon Appstore were all fine visually, but we have a feeling the Leap didn't access the full catalogue of apps, which is available on Android smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, just like Google Play, BlackBerry World offers more than just apps - you can buy music, movies and TV shows from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Amazon Appstore is where you can access compatible Android apps for the device. There is a paid app available for free every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also sideload the Play Store by installing first Google Account manager and BlackBerry Google ID. It supports auto app update.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Conceived as a more affordable alternative to the Z30, the BlackBerry Leap doesn't really manage to exceed the sum of its parts. On the other hand losing the AMOLED panel for a traditional LCD screen and employing the older Adreno 225, allowed the new handset to bring the price down and bring much of the same experience at a more attractive price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered the BlackBerry Leap is a capable chap, perfect for messaging, decent at snapping pictures and great at browsing and organizing tasks. It's also got the business appeal which is part of the BlackBerry DNA that will get the right kind of attention at a business meeting. Yet in this day and age, the ?230 that the Leap goes for can get you a lot of smartphone so mainstream appeal will likely be out of reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the promises made, the BlackBerry Leap is far from ideal mid-ranger when it comes to running Android apps - it's got both limited compatibility and sub-par performance for the class. So if you are of the app-crazed type that thinks this might be a great chance to get the best of both worlds you should move along - there's nothing for you to see here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>But as always the best way to illustrate a handset's strengths and weaknesses is to compare it to its peers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are after the BlackBerry brand and don't mind switching to a smaller screen, the pioneer BlackBerry Z10 matches the Leap spec-for-spec and can be found at far lower price. Availability for this one is limited at this point of its life cycle, but if you manage to find it, it's certainly a better place to start with BlackBerry 10 OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Z10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If BlackBerry isn't a must, you can have a look at the Android camp and the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact. Costing the same as the Leap this one offers a Snapdragon 800 chipset and 20.7MP camera in a waterproof body - far exceeding the value for money of the Leap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z1 Compact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto G (2014) is also is another interesting droid that costs about ?50 less than the Leap, while offering superior performance and full access to the Google Play catalog. It doesn't have the innovative gestures of the BlackBerry OS 10, but its near-vanilla Android experience is appreciated by many a fan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto G (2nd gen)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are willing to get another less popular platform a chance, you should check out the Lumia 830. Its price has settled at about ?240, which nets you 5" IPS 720p display, a quad-core processor, 16GB of storage, LTE connectivity and a premium 10MP ZEISS camera with optical image stabilization and some PureView tech. Choosing between that one and the Leap is about picking which platform you prefer and whether you value camera over messaging or the other way around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 830</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the BlackBerry Leap might not be the value-for money hit that will tempt thousands of Android users to switch, but it's not without its niche. Those that aren't installing too many apps and would appreciate a new experience then you might give it a second look. And if you are BlackBerry faithful that's yet to experience the full-touch version of BlackBerry 10, the Leap is a decent starting point.</paragraph>
