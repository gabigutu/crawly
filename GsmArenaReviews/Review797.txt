			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What if you stripped the HTC One (M8) of the metal armor it's so proud of. Imagine replacing it for plastic. Sounds like the worst thing that could happen to the top model of a struggling company. The HTC One (E8) will heartily disagree. If anything is lost, it's mostly weight, not dignity. For all we know, this edition feels like a refreshed version of the flagship complete with a new polycarbonate back, but with the same software package and even some extra processing power and a camera that's better by our books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (M8) is one of the most beautiful flagships of this generation. Perhaps not as feature-rich and inventive as most competitors, the One is still the one to beat for looks. The all-aluminum unibody is a pleasure to behold and has a matching feel in hand. The HTC One (E8) tunes in and offers and alternative reality version of what the second iteration of the One could have been.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ok, in practice, the One (E8) is expected to be targeted at price-conscious consumers who found the HTC One (M8) too cost-prohibitive. And it won't even be available everywhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The newcomer is nonetheless powered by a more recent, 3rd generation Snapdragon 801 chipset and HTC does well to replace a thoroughly disappointing 4MP Ultrapixel camera with a more standard 13MP sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it can be viewed as a step down in the design department, the One (E8) is an important weapon in HTC's arsenal - a more affordable flagship to help HTC regain some market share lost to competitors like Samsung, Sony, and even Apple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick look at what the HTC One (E8) is all about:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To keep costs down, we see that HTC has omitted a few other extras as well, mostly in the connectivity department. The centrally-located power button no long doubles as an IR-port for controlling TV's and other appliances, while the new 802.11ac wireless standard isn't supported either, nor does the microUSB port offer MHL TV-out connectivity or USB On-the-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC does make up for this by throwing in a 13MP camera, like you'd find on the likes of the HTC One mini 2 or Desire 816. We saw vastly improved imaging in those devices compared to the 4MP UltraPixel of the M8, and we're hoping to get the same here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equally important is the shift from the metal-clad unibody to polycarbonate. There are both poor- and well-built plastic phones, so we'll be taking a close look at the HTC One (E8) from a design standpoint to see where it sits in that regard. Join us on the next page where we'll do just that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) has virtually identical dimensions to its metal-clad counterpart. At 146.4 x 70.1 x 9.9mm, it has the same height as the M8, while being 0.1mm wider and 0.5mm thicker. More significantly, it weighs in at 145g - 15g lighter than the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By and large, the two devices feel very similar in-hand, the weight and finish being the most significant difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality, and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering its heritage, the defining characteristic of the One (E8) is its polycarbonate back panel. Previous HTC flagships relied heavily on metal to set them apart (the M8 being a whopping 90% aluminum alloy), so it's a serious change that HTC has undertaken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said before, polycarbonate construction depends heavily on execution, and in the case of the E8, HTC has done splendidly. The glossy white finish does get its fair share of fingerprint smudges, but that's well compensated for by the very snug fit of the back panel, which wraps around the top and bottom of the device. There are also red and black color options available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rounded corners and the rear curvature introduced with the HTC One (M7) are still here. On the sides, the polycarbonate back takes up about half the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a thickness just shy of 10mm it's a step down from the 9.4mm of the One (M8), but it's not a bulk that you'll necessarily notice or mind, despite competitors' thickness being closer to 8mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the M8, the height is a bit too much for our liking, but the device certainly still handles well, and one-handed operation is possible except on the very extreme ends of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In line with our high expectations, the HTC One (E8) deserves nothing but praise for its design and finish. The smartphone has retained the wonderful visual presence of the original, yet it looks fresh thanks to the new color scheme and updated design.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the front, you'll find the same 5-inch 1080p display with Gorilla Glass 3, dual BoomSound speakers, and a 5MP front-facer next to some sensors around the earpiece. Like on the One M8, the capacitive buttons are part of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nano-SIM card slot is located on the left side of the device. The volume rocker and the microSD card slot are on the right side of the smartphone. This is the same positioning as on the HTC One (M8), although the spacing is slightly altered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top houses a centrally-located power/lock button, although it does not double as an IR-port like on the M8. The positioning does take some getting used to, and is less reachable than a button that is off to either side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB/charging port and the 3.5mm audio jack are located at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The non-removable back panel is where the 13MP shooter sits. The dual-camera setup found on the M8 is gone, with the second camera being replaced by an LED flash on the E8. There is also a secondary microphone pinhole next to the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the smartphone will also be home to carrier branding.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) features a 5" Full HD IPS display with a pixel density of 441ppi, the same one that's found on the HTC One (M8). It's covered by Gorilla Glass 3 and accommodates almost permanently visible on-screen navigating buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a closer look at it under our digital microscope proves this, as the two panels show an identical RGB pattern and pixel size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Running our display test again provides very similar findings, with the E8 providing marginally better contrast at 50% brightness, and the M8 being more contrasty at 100%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) has a respectable sunlight contrast ratio as well, resulting in a score that places it in the upper half of our sunlight legibility charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Has the same 2,600mAh non-removable Lithium Polymer battery as the HTC One (M8). While the M8 was able to post a respectable 71 hour endurance rating, the E8 is able to do even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the E8 doesn't do as well when it comes to 3G talk time, it makes up for it with over 10 hours of web browsing, and over 11 hours of video playback time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, this results in a 77 hour endurance rating, which means that you can use the HTC One (E8) for over three days and do an hour each of calling, web browsing, and watching videos each day, and still have some left in the tank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Standby power draw is included in the calculations, though the exact number isn't listed in the scorecard above. You can find more about the HTC One (E8) battery life in our blog post. Details on the testing procedure can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) packs a solid set of connectivity features, with a few omissions compared to the M8. You still get quad-band GSM, 3G, and LTE support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and stereo Bluetooth 4.0 with the higher-quality aptX codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no Wi-Fi ac support however. The lack of an IR emitter is another glaring omission, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the One to a PC. The long list of options includes Portable Wi-Fi hotspot, settings, USB and Bluetooth tethering (the phone becomes a modem).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC connectivity with Android Beam is present too. We found it to work with no hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a microSD card slot too supporting up to 128GB of storage. In addition, the device also comes with 50GB of free Google Drive storage for two years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, compared to the One (M8), the microUSB port of the One (E8) lacks TV-out functionality and there is no support for USB host or USB On-the-go.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android KitKat with Sense 6 UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) comes powered with the latest Android 4.4.2 KitKat alongside HTC's Sense 6 overlay. Under Sense 6, the user interface has been improved and it's also better looking. The built-in apps each have a different accent color which spills out onto the status bar, changing its color to create a uniform effect - similar to what we've seen with Apple's iOS 7. Sense 6 looks and feels just like on the HTC One (M8) and there are very little changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a brief rundown of Sense 6 UI on the HTC One (E8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen hasn't really changed much since Sense 5 - there's a clock with weather information and four app shortcuts. Swiping up takes you to the last app you used, while swiping to the left or to the right will take you to the homescreen or BlinkFeed, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) offers Motion Launch features like on the HTC One (M8). You can unlock the device with a swipe on its screen or a double tap when the latter is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you unlock you're greeted by a practically identical homescreen as before and virtual on screen buttons. Having the buttons on-screen ensures better response time and less chance of operational deterioration but also means you're effectively giving up part of your screen estate in order to accommodate them there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background behind the buttons is transparent and they obediently move out the way when you're watching a video or image so it's not that bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leftmost homescreen pane of the One (E8) is reserved for HTC BlinkFeed. It aggregates content from your social networks, as well as from various news sources. You can pick what topics you're interested in and BlinkFeed will automatically pull fresh content for you. You can also search for specific content. You can also turn BlinkFeed off if you prefer or choose to not have it be the default homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get up to five homescreen panes to fill with shortcuts and widgets (the sixth is reserved for BlinkFeed). You can set any of the panes as default - including the BlinkFeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is business as usual - you get notifications in the right page and quick toggles in the left. You can access the quick toggles by a tap in the upper right corner or through a two finger swipe down from the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is vertically scrolled unlike stock Android or most current Android OSes like TouchWiz, Xperia or Optimus UI. Aside from the usual alphabetical and chronological order of apps you can also sort them in a way you see fit. The grid of apps can either be a 3 x 4 or the more sensible 4 x 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting to the recently-opened apps is done with the dedicated on-screen button. The interface shows a list of thumbnails for each app. You can swipe them away one by one as before or use the new close all option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also get to the task manager from the recent apps screen - it shows you the currently active apps and RAM usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wallpapers, lockscreen style, ringtones, notification sounds and alarms can be customized via a dedicated menu. This time around, the lockscreen styles cannot be changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) also has a built-in restricted access Kids mode. It is an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they can have access to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything runs buttery smooth on the HTC One (E8). The software is well optimized for the hardware within, Sense 6 looks and feels snappy and is very easy to use despite departing from the basic UI laws of Android at places (like the app drawer).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) comes with a quad-core 2.5GHz Krait 400 CPU and Adreno 330 GPU on a Qualcomm MSM8975AC Snapdragon 801 chipset. Including the 2GB of RAM, this is virtually the same configuration you'll find as on the HTC One (M8), except that the M8 sports the MSM8974AB chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 and AnTuTu 4 are benchmarks, which put to the test the hardware combo inside the smartphone. GeekBench 3 is more CPU-intensive, whereas AnTuTu 4 is a compound benchmark - testing CPU, GPU, memory performance, etc. The HTC One (E8) was able to pump out some excellent results in both tests. It managed to outdo the handily outclass its metal-clad counterpart in GeekBench, and was second only to the Oppo Find 7 in AnTuTu.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Next up we have GFXBench's 2.7 T-Rex and 3.0 Manhattan. In 1080p offscreen mode the GPU is tasked with performing graphical computations in 1920 x 1080px resolution, while the onscreen mode uses the screen's native resolution, which is also 1080p. Hence, the two onscreen and offscreen numbers are very close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In both the older T-Rex test and the more advanced Manhattan benchmark, the device posted some very impressive numbers - in fact outdoing or matching many top flagships.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>When it comes to browsing performance, the E8 again performed well. BrowserMark 2.1 looks after HTML 5 performance, while Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 is JavaScript-centric. The HTC One (E8) again managed to trounce its M8 sibling, falling behind only to the Galaxy S5 and Oppo Find 7 in these benchmarks.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single, multi-core performance, math performance and more. We focus on the overall and CPU scores. The HTC One (E8) got similar results in both the regular and anti-cheat, with the variation between results not being enough to indicate behind the scenes overclocking of the processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here, the E8 was able to able to again post impressive results, although generally closer to those posted by the M8. The most noticeable difference is in the multi-core figures, where variations tend to be larger regardless.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) has proven to be one of the best performing HTC devices to date, and goes a long way in compensating for its lack of metal. Whether it's subtle optimizations done to the software package, or improvements thrown in by the more robust Snapdragon 801 variant, the E8 handily outclasses the M8 when it comes to performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook via the People app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the People app, you get the dialer, contacts, groups (including favorite contacts), as well as a call log. You can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays a contact's social networking updates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony does great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC One (E8) combines your keypad, recent call list and contact list in one application accessible via a single icon. You switch between the view modes with side-swipes. There's smart dialing and it works as well as expected. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number. You can use a QWERTY keyboard for searching as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone packs a neat set of call-related tricks such as automatically silencing the ring of an incoming call just by putting the phone face down or raising the volume if the device senses it's in a pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the single loudspeakers remains in line the excellent-sounding HTC One mini from last year and compared to the HTC One (M7) and (M8). The sound comes out deep and well-accentuated. It's particularly nice to enjoy videos or games as the sound comes directly at you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BoomSound enhancement is constantly on when you are listening to something via the loudspeakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudness, on the other hand, isn't all that impressive. The HTC One (E8) didn't perform very well when it came to midtones or vocals. The only place where it was able to score a good volume is the high tones. We got an overall Average score when we measured its loudness with our digital loudness meter. Check out more about our tests and our loudness test in particular.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) is capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. There's also Google Hangouts, which can connect you to Google contacts via either texts or video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sense 6 intuitively lists all of your conversations in a single thread - whether you're texting the same person on a new number and then go back to the old one - it's all chronologically listed in a single thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single interface with a unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app uses a navy blue top bar and merges it with the status bar for a nice design accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for typing, the E8s on-screen keyboard offers well-spaced keys, but the overlay doesn't include any gaps between them. During use we found that this is only a cosmetic feature and poses no discomfort. The 4.5" display diagonal offers enough space for comfortable typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Trace keyboard is also available. You drag a finger over the desired keys and the phone predicts what you're trying to type. It works really well but language support is limited.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Zoe<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Zoe is a mini social network centered on sharing photos and videos. A landmark feature is the cool Highlights videos, which are created automatically for each album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense 6 features Zoe as a standalone multimedia app, which requires you to sign in with your HTC account the first time you open it. Captured photos and videos are automatically compiled into a Zoe video highlight reel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating a Zoe is easy. You simply choose from the available images and rearrange them in order you like. Themes and soundtracks are available in case you want to be extra creative. Once finished editing, you can easily share Zoes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe also allows you to collaborate with friends on the same project. You can send requests and combine your media content into the same Zoe. Keep in mind that the app doesn't work in all regions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slideshow-happy gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The regular image gallery stacks photos together in albums, which can be organized by the date they were captured or the source they come from. Location-based sorting is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there is an array of available options at your disposal. You can edit, share, highlight, and delete images. You can also set them as backgrounds, assign them to contacts, add them to a specific album, or print them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open an album, the first and biggest thumbnail is reserved for slideshows. Once you tap it you can customize if you want an effect added over the photos and what sort of music you would like to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports viewing your images in their full resolution. You can easily pinch-zoom to 1:1 magnification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display on the HTC One (E8) is more than adequate in both size and quality to allow for enjoyable image consumption.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player lacks subtitle support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the HTC One (E8) has a rather simple interface. There isn't a dedicated app - you just pick a video from the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to capture images from the video, volume slider, and sharing options. All of these hide automatically after a few seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) video player had somewhat spotty video codec support. It did not play DivX videos, but MKV files on the other hand weren't a problem all the way up to 1080p. WMV videos were trouble-free as well. For the most part, XVID played but had issues with the sound AAC and AC3 coded sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles were also not supported, with no options to enable them nor did they automatically playback if in the same folder as the video file.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense 6 music player features a similar layout as the one in the previous version. The flattened interface design however makes the setup look fresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is organized by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders (we don't see this last option very often). The phone will also easily stream songs over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can automatically look for and download Album art and artist photos (you can limit it to Wi-Fi connections only), and search for lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no equalizer on board. You have the option to toggle BoomSound audio on or off when you have the headphones plugged in. Like we mentioned already, you cannot adjust this feature when playing through the speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM Radio is aboard with RDS support. It automatically saves available stations and has one of the simplest interfaces we've seen. There are play controls - play, stop, skip and a loudspeaker option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality up there with the best<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) put in a stellar performance in our audio quality test. Just like most of its stablemates we've tested recently it had excellently high volume levels to go with a perfectly clean output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone produced some of the best scores we've seen in the test, while remaining louder than just about any non-HTC smartphone out there. The One (E8) is one of the easiest to recommend handsets if you are looking to get a proper audiophile experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No UltraPixels, no problem<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update August 4: We've updated the below section to reflect our latest findings with the HTC One (E8) camera. The new samples are much closer to what we saw on the HTC One mini 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) sees a departure from HTC's Ultrapixel sensor technology and comes with a standard 13 MP snapper on the back, sided by a single LED flash. The sensor has a native 4:3 aspect ratio as opposed to the 16:9 wider aspect of its predecessor - photos come out with a resolution of 4224 x 3136px - more than three times the pixel count of the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aperture sits at f/2.2, which isn't as wide as the one on the HTC One (M8) or even as wide as the f/2.0 of the 5 MP front-facing shooter, for that matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how it compares to the HTC One (M8). The M8 is upscaled to 13MP:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike other 13MP HTC offerings (like those on the Desire 816 and mini 2) in the aftermath of the UltraPixel camera days, the sensor found on the One (E8) comes with the company's proprietary ImageChip technology, so you do get Zoe mode, where the phone will capture a 3sec video along with every photo you make and can later auto create beautiful stories about particular events made out of stills and videos. It also has HDR, Panorama (with a digital horizon level), geo-tagging and image effects. The more advanced settings are hidden by default, but you can also control ISO, exposure compensation, white balance and a few other image adjustments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how it compares to the 13MP shooter on the HTC One mini 2:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on the screen will enable Auto Exposure and Auto Focus lock. You can set the volume rocker to act as a zoom lever or a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) has a 5MP front-facing camera with a BSI sensor and a dedicated selfie mode. From the settings you can enable smile shutter and adjust the Make-up level, which tries to digitally pretty you up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is very good across the frame, comparable to that of the HTC One mini 2. You get a good balance of fine detail and noise, and while there's no oil-canvas effect up close, there are certain situations where the resolved detail is not as high. White balance seemed to also be a hint better than what we saw on the mini 2, but it tends to lean towards blue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The E8 also had sharper edge performance than the mini 2 - while that 13MP sensor tended to compress the edges of the frame, the E8 was crisp throughout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Face detection on the HTC One (E8) is always on and cannot be turned off in the settings. It works really well and can recognize a face immediately and even track it well when it moves across the frame. The downside is that when face detection captures a face it will expose for it, which would sometimes ruin your overall exposure, which is a bummer. This can be fixed by manually locking exposure where you want it to be but then you risk losing focus of your subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's face it, when you're taking pictures of people you'd want face detection on so we're not taking points away from HTC here. We just wish there was a setting to turn it off at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR is short for High Dynamic Range and the HDR mode of the HTC One (E8) camera snaps a couple of photos with different exposures and then combines them into a single photo. The HDR mode on the E8 tends to expose for the highlights and then brightens up the shadows in the scene. This in turn produces images with nice and even exposure, and without a nasty overly-contrasted, exaggerated look.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) offers 1080p videos at 60fps, though there's also a 30fps mode for fullHD videos, and 120fps mode at 720p. The front-facing camera can also record 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p videos default at 30fps, and carry a bitrate of just under 20 Mbps. Framerate was a constant 30fps throughout the video. Audio bitrate sits high up with 192 Kbps and offers two channels (read stereo) and has a regular sampling rate of 48 kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the videos is on par with that of the still images. They come out with comparable sharpness, contrast and saturation that we saw in the still images, and the colors are also accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 60fps mode is very similar, having the same 20 Mbps bitrate and dual channel audio at 192 Kbps. In this mode there's a slightly wider field of view, however, which means that you'll capture more in the frame, but it won't be as detailed. There's also a yellowish tint to the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>60fps mode works just as advertised, however, and will result in videos that are much smoother than the standard 30fps ones, and are surprisingly not that much larger either. As YouTube does not yet support 60fps uploads, we've added a direct link to both videos below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download the 1080p@30fps (0:15s, 38MB) and 1080p@60fps (0:30s, 72MB) samples taken directly from the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the 720p slow motion mode has relatively poor video quality, and seems upscaled from an even lower resolution. We say relatively because we've seen even worse attempts at slow motion video. The E8s results are far from optimal in this regard, but they still manage a bitrate of 12 Mbps, so it's better than most.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) comes with a Sense-ified version of the stock Android browser and Chrome out of box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock browser packs the usual features: Incognito tabs, Find in page and Desktop view. GIF animation can be enabled from the settings, but there is no Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the usual bookmarks, you can keep a Reading list of pages to read later and a Watch list of videos. Pages are saved on-device so they can be read offline, but videos are not. The Watch list feature works on sites like YouTube and Vimeo. It detects multiple videos per page (so you can add them all) and when you're ready, you can check them out without any distractions from the page they were on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is becoming the most popular mobile browser and should be fairly familiar. It has some advantages over its vanilla-flavored buddy, including switching between tabs with a wide swipe from either the left or right of the top bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome has Incognito tabs, too. Speaking of tabs, it can sync what you have open on other devices (desktop, tablets) with the phone. This feature also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites and can remember passwords and login data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reduce data usage option sends web pages to be compressed on Google's web servers before loading them on the device to save data and speed up slow connections. This doesn't work for SSL-protected pages and Incognito tabs for privacy reasons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Tasks app is HTCs way of letting you organize your time. It can handle multiple separate lists of tasks and syncs with your Google account. Each task can have a due date and a location associated with it. Map view lets you easily find nearby tasks, though we would have loved a "Navigate to" button here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Drive comes preinstalled. It combines all of your documents, spreadsheets, images and more in one easy to use data vault app. You can also access more than a single Google Drive if you have multiple profiles on your smartphone, which is neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock application can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The stopwatch and timer are self-explanatory. There's also a Calculator, Calendar and a Flash app that sets the power of the back-placed LED to three strengths.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Backup can do manual or scheduled backups of your apps, messages (texts and emails), contacts and accounts (mail and social). The data is sent either to Google Drive or Dropbox and you can limit the app to transfer over Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice Google searches as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Weather app can give you weather information for your location and others. It looks great and gives you an animated representation of the weather conditions as well as a multiple-day forecast. Weather information is sourced from AccuWeather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Guide app is an excellent app for beginners. It contains tips and help, troubleshooting info and a display of the vital phone stats the support call center might ask you about. The Phone health option offers some self-help tools like running diagnostic on individual components (speakers, backlight, buttons).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app will also help you manage the storage with a handy option to clean unwanted files and trackers for call minutes, texts and data plan megabytes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the default navigation app, but it's most useful when you use it while you are online. It allows you to download offline maps of an area and even plan routes without a data connection but you can't search for addresses or POIs without an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, it can plan driving, public transport, cycling and walking routes. It can also display pretty accurate traffic alerts as well (though it doesn't always take them into account when routing you).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another great support tool is Android Device Manager. It's available for all Android devices linked to your Google account. It can help you find your misplaced HTC One (E8) by ringing it and if it's not at the house, by finding it on the map. If it's stolen, you also have the option to lock the device and delete all data (so make sure you have HTC Backup set up to work automatically so you don't lose your data). You have to enable the remote locking initially via the preinstalled Google Settings app on your smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, Google's Play store hardly needs any description. It the biggest catalog of apps and also features movies, TV, music and even devices but those services are dependent on your country. Opening the store brings you highlighted apps based on recommendations and your usage. There are categories, ranked apps and more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One series has at least one feature it can hang its hat on - premium design. This became absolutely critical with the M8, as the scorching hot flagship was outclassed by its competitors in many other areas - performance and camera being the most obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes the One (E8) - one that has to make do with its seemingly biggest advantage taken away, the aluminum unibody and its slick finish and chamfered edges replaced by polycarbonate. Now, isn't that a recipe for disaster? Especially for a company that's been struggling to regain lost market share, you'd think that moving away from your strongest suit would be a mistake. The HTC One (E8), however, has proven to be anything but.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the M8 is still quite a stunner whose only real rival in terms of design is the Sony Xperia Z2, it has proven to have several weaknesses that have since been taken advantage of by the competition. With the M8, HTC chose to stick to its 4MP UltraPixel guns second generation running, despite the lackluster performance. The Qualcomm MSM8974AB Snapdragon 801 chip that the M8 came with has also since been outperformed by competing flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) solves both of those problems, and solves them handily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One (E8) key test findings:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We said in the beginning of this review that polycarbonate smartphones depend highly on execution, and the snug fit of the E8s plastic back panel is an example of a well-executed design aesthetic. Of course, some of the premium feel is gone but HTC has the freedom to target a different price segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the E8 won't go for as little as half the price of an M8 - far from it. But with a superior battery life, slick Sense 6 interface, and vastly improved camera and processing speed, it has all the makings of a sleeper hit for a company that desperately needs one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On paper, the M8 is still the creme-de-la-creme of what HTC or any manufacturer for that matter, can offer from a design standpoint. Its premium build is arguably the top of the food chain when it comes to Android flagships, and it really is a marvel to behold - and hold. The M8 does have an inferior camera and performance though, and you will be paying a premium for all that sweet metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One (M8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M8s predecessor, the One M7, is also an interesting offering when compared to the E8. It has the premium looks and build on top of being more compact. Due to its 4.7-inch display (that's also 1080p and thus has a higher pixel density than the M8/E8), the M7 is able to shave almost 10mm off the height of the E8, which results in much better handling and single-handed usability. The M7 is over a year old, however, and although it's been updated to Sense 6, it has a much slower processor and lower battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google/LGs Nexus 5 is another worthy competitor to the E8. It's priced even more competitively, and also sports a 1080p display with Gorilla Glass 3. It comes in more compact and lighter than the HTC as well, and runs vanilla Android with all the latest updates directly from Google. Its 8MP shooter won't impress as much however, and neither will the lower performance, battery life, and lack of expandable storage or FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Nexus 5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola, now under Lenovo's wing, offered its compelling Moto X smartphone during the company's brief stint under Google. It offers an eye-catching design aesthetic and is more compact and lighter than the E8. It only has a dual-core performance, a 720p screen, and again lacks expandable storage, but you're looking at the usual updates from Google relatively quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One (E8) is a bit of a surprise move. A less sophisticated but more capable alternative of the incumbent flagship. And that's considering the M8 has already had a mini and a dual-SIM version. HTC limited the cost-cutting to the exterior and the E8 is set to offer a killer package with very few glaring drawbacks. Fewer than the actual flagship, at the very least. If excellent battery life, superb performance, and a robust software suite at a competitive price aren't enough to make you notice the HTC One (E8), it's hard to see what will. Provided HTC's idea of a discount isn't a shock to everyone. Again.</paragraph>
