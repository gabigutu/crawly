			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first attempts at a projector phone didn't quite work out for Samsung. For many that would be enough to call it a day, but not the Koreans. You don't become the world's number 1 phone manufacturer by giving up easily, so Samsung chose to take a step back, learn from mistakes and give it another go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I8530 Galaxy Beam takes a completely different approach to making a projector phone and a smartphone work together. Last time around, with the original Beam, Samsung took a high-end device and slapped a rather advanced projector on its back, effectively ending up with something very thick and expensive, which was nearly impossible to sell. Thicker devices lack the high-end vibe one normally associates with smartphones in that price range, so it never really managed to get going.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The I8530 Galaxy Beam on the other hand aims far lower - it's based on a mid-range phone and throws in a projector that's good enough for casual use. Serious, corporate use is out of the question here, but that was never in the requirements, and you get a more compact and reasonably priced package instead. Now add the NovaThor chipset and its dual-core CPU and you get a deal that's definitely worth a second look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Samsung I8530 Galaxy Beam is basically a Galaxy S Advance with an extra DLP projector and a different screen. The lack of character in the overcrowded mid-range was the main thing wrong with the Samsung mid-range flagship, and it seems like the Beam made easy work of adding some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, for all its sensible, down-to-earth approach, the Samsung I8530 Galaxy Beam still ends up priced notably higher than smartphones using the same screens and based on the same chipsets. So it will have to try and convince us that it's really offering something extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good build quality would be a nice start - follow us on the next page where the hardware checkup begins.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Rich retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package that the Samsung I8530 Galaxy Beam comes in had a couple of nice surprises in store. The first thing is a stand that lets you place the Beam on a table or bedside cabinet. Sadly, the angle it's propped up at makes it useless for video watching, unless the ceiling is your screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool side feature of the said stand though is that it's able to charge the spare battery, which is also supplied in the retail package. With the power-hungry projector at hand, the Galaxy Beam is likely to make good use of the extra juice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other items in the bundle are a pair of headphones with some spare earbuds, a charger and a microUSB data cable. Those last three items are usually all you get with mid-range and upper mid-range devices, so it's really great treatment you are getting here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've creating a brief unboxing and hardware tour of the Beam here:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I8530 Galaxy Beam 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The I8530 Samsung Galaxy Beam is genuinely trying to improve on the ergonomics its predecessor. Not that you should expect a phone with a built-in projector to be ultra-compact. At 124 x 64.2 x 12.5 the new Beam is slightly taller but a good 2.4 mm slimmer and more than 10g lighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The I8530 Galaxy Beam has a bigger screen than the original, but the resolution stays the same and it's a garden variety LCD and not a Super AMOLED.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Place the Samsung I8530 Galaxy Beam down on a table and you'll hardly be able to tell it apart from a Samsung Galaxy R or an S Advance. A side view exposes its thicker waistline which takes away some of the device's appeal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone has an all plastic construction but, considering the weight of 145g, other materials were probably never really an option. The plastic used is of pretty decent quality, so it's not really all bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a secondary camera above the display, as well as proximity and ambient light sensors. Moving below the display you'll find the usual hardware Home button with two capacitive controls on the sides: Menu and Back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The projector lens is placed at the top, deeply inset under a big piece of protective glass. It stays out of the way most of the time and only slightly protrudes at the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More than once during our test, it felt the lens would've made sense on one of the sides of the smartphone, given the projector's default orientation is landscape but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The projector can be used as a flashlight as well, and it's quite suited to the job too, if you don't mind the relatively small lit surface. Its placement certainly feels more natural than a LED on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the handset, closest to the top, is the dedicated projector key. A little further down is the usual power/lock button. We did mix those two up at first, hitting the projector button instead of the unlock button. However, it doesn't take too long to get used to the arrangement. The last thing to note on the right is a hot-swappable microSD card slot hidden under a small lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is on the left, where we were surprised to find an external SIM slot as well. It's quite out of the ordinary for the SIM compartment to be placed on the outside but the phone's inner body is almost entirely sealed. It's actually bolted to the front, making the smartphone more dust-resistant than usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Galaxy Beam features the mouthpiece and a microUSB port for charging and data connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover of the Galaxy Beam is entirely made of plastic but benefits from a nice anti-slip rubbery finish. There's a slight bulge at the top to accommodate the projector. The 5 MP camera lens is centrally placed right below that bulge, with a single LED flash at its side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the bottom left corner is the loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 2,000 mAh Li-Ion battery. It is said to last for up to 760h of stand-by or 9h 40 min of talk time on a 3G network . If you stick to 2G you get the same stand-by endurance but the maximum achievable talk time jumps to up to 20h.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the Beam through our traditional battery test and came up with a pretty impressive overall endurance rating of 52h. For more info on our battery testing process go here, while the full battery test on the Galaxy Beam can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the important differences between the two generations of projector phones by Samsung is the screen size and technology. The original Beam had a 3.7" Super AMOLED screen. The one we're reviewing has grown to 4 inches but is a regular LCD unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WVGA (480 x 800) resolution works out to a pixel density of around 233 ppi. It's a pretty good display, even if some way off the best on the market. Contrast is good and colors are OK for an LCD, while the viewing angles are surprisingly good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Samsung Galaxy Beam through our usual display tests and we are now giving you its results. You can find more about the testing procedures here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is the Galaxy Beam's screen Achilles? heel. As you can see from our measurements the Galaxy Beam is one of the worse performers we have subjected to this test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We zoomed into the display using our digital microscope so you can get a better idea of how the pixels are arranged, and how big they are. As you can see the pixels are slightly larger than those on the Ace 2, which suggests slightly lower perceived sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Galaxy Beam display pixels compared to those of the Galaxy Ace 2</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam is not the slimmest phone out there, not by a long shot, but it's extremely well put together and reasonably ergonomic. It's comfortable and secure to hold, and fairly easy to operate with one hand. It seems that a stable stand will be most welcome in projector mode, and the one that comes in the box isn't the best solution. It does well to charge the extra battery though and that's a great option to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Projector<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We'll start off our usual interface tour with the Galaxy Beam's key feature and main selling point: the projector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The projector interface has changed slightly since we previewed the Beam a few months back. Here's a demo video of the device in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once on, a menu appears on the display, allowing you to quickly adjust the focal length, rotation, and access the Quick pad. You can bring up this quick menu at any time by just tapping the projector button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Quick Pad mode you can use a pointer or a pen to highlight specific bits. You can set the color and thickness of the underline, and there's an eraser as well. Once activated, the Quick Pad integrates with the Notification area, so you can enable and disable the various options as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolution is enough for videos and even presentations (as long as the font size isn't too small). Samsung claims that at a 2 meter distance, the image size is 50". At 15 lumens, the projector isn't very bright even with the maximum brightness setting, so to get good results at that distance you'll need a very dark room. In brighter lighting, you'll need to keep much closer to the wall in order to produce easily visible image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When using the projector in portrait mode you are essentially getting a crop, as landscape mode is when the projector uses its entire nHD resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device also comes with a dedicated projector app, which features all of the options above as well as a few new ones. Here's where you'll find settings for brightness and screen orientation. You can also configure when the Beam display turns off, which can be useful when watching video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Visual presenter turns on both the rear-facing camera and projector simultaneously, and lets you use the beam as an overhead projector. Fortunately, this mode is automatically displayed in landscape mode, and is much more convenient than trying to type on display directly using the Quick Pad. You do need some sort of mount in order to use this effectively, however, as using your other hand to hold it above whatever you're trying to write is not too comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is Ambience mode - you can use it to create a customizable mood light, which can display images, videos and sounds from your gallery and music player. Briefing mode is an alarm app of sorts, which automatically turns on the projector at a given time, complete with snooze time, fade time and a tone to go with it. You can also choose what sort of information to display, such as the weather or your daily schedule. The Torch light app lets you use the projector as a flashlight to project one of four solid colors (white, red, green, blue).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A white wall works well enough for a projection surface if you don't have a special projection screen. This means all you need is a Galaxy Beam in your pocket and you can share your photos with a large group of people (it's way more comfortable than everyone huddled over a small mobile phone screen), watch a movie or do a presentation in any office you walk into.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2,000 mAh battery is rated at 3 hours of projection time, which should be good enough for either of those activities. If you make a habit of carrying the spare one with you, you can get double the endurance, which would be enough for watching two or even three movies in a row.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz up front<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most of the Samsung's current lineup, the Galaxy Beam (still) finds itself firmly in the land of Gingerbread, accompanied by the ever-familiar, but, by now, rather dated TouchWiz 4.0 UX.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen of the Galaxy Beam has the usual integration of missed events but doesn't go any further. It's the "drag your finger outside of the circle" type of lockscreen but no shortcuts like on the Galaxy S III. You do get music player controls though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen accommodates plenty of widgets with lots of functionality. You can have up to 7 homescreen panes. A pinch zoom provides an aggregate view of all homescreen panes, which can be rearranged, deleted or added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In typical TouchWiz fashion, there are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the screen that are visible both on the homescreen and in the app drawer. The first three are user-configurable (Phone, Contacts, Messaging), the fourth one being locked. It's the app drawer/home shortcut so it makes sense to always keep it in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding widgets, shortcuts, folders or changing wallpapers is via a context menu that pops up on demand at the bottom of the screen. The list of available widgets can be swipe-scrolled while providing a smooth animation throughout. You can also swipe each of the homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is very similar to the homescreen - you can create folders and pages by dragging them to the appropriate icon at the bottom of the screen. You can also rearrange pages from the same aggregate view as the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>List view can be enabled in the app drawer instead of the regular grid view. There's also a preview of all your app drawer screens for quicker browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has toggles that give you easy access from anywhere in the interface to the following functions: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, silent mode and screen auto-rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Galaxy Beam I8530 you get a standard Android task switcher with the traditional Samsung modification - it has a button to launch a task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom task manager offers a lot of functionality, such as seeing what sort of RAM footprint your apps have, or how much storage is available. It also comes with a handy widget, which shows you the number of active applications right on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the time, Android does really well when it comes to managing apps by itself (in fact, some claim that using a task manager is detrimental to the performance of a phone), so you would only need the task manager to occasionally kill a buggy app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam I8530 is powered by a NovaThor U8500 chipset with a dual-core 1GHz processor. With 768MB of RAM and Mali-400 GPU, the overall performance should be enough to hold its own amongst midrange smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the projector not only adds a few millimeters around the waist, but it also swells the price a bit. That's why in this test we've included some devices which can easily be defined as being in a higher-end category than the Galaxy Beam specs-wise, but fall within the same price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similarly, you'll see devices here which have a lower retail cost than the Galaxy Beam, but are included because they are very similar in terms of specifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've included both of these classes of devices to illustrate both what sort of value you can expect from other devices at this price point, as well as what sort of offerings are available if you're willing to forego the Beam's main selling point - the projector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Benchmark Pi measures processor performance, and has the Samsung Galaxy Beam sitting firmly in midrange territory. It handily managed to beat out the Galaxy Ace 2, which shares its chipset and GPU, but is clocked at 200 MHz lower. Unsurprisingly, the similarly-priced HTC One series phones and the Galaxy S III are a step ahead here due to their superior hardware specifications and updated Android builds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same trend continues in the Linpack test, where only slight differences in RAM amounts differentiate the Beam from the two Xperia phones. The Galaxy S Advance is also on par with these devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were pleasantly surprised by how well the Galaxy Beam performed in our 3D graphics benchmark, NenaMark 2. It handily outperformed the other U8500-based droids, and the over-30fps rating is certainly adequate for 3D gaming applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A more drastic division can be seen in the GLBenchmark offscreen performance test, as a huge jump can be seen between the NovaThor Gingerbread devices and the competition. Some solace can be taken in the fact that these tests emulate 720p resolution - something the Galaxy Beam will never have to run.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark Egypt (offscreen 720p)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the SunSpider and BrowserMark tests, the Galaxy Beam performs the best out of the other Gingerbread devices, although results were fairly close amongst these devices, with the exception of the slower Galaxy Ace 2. ICS web optimizations and superior hardware specs account for the advantages the HTC devices and the Galaxy S III hold over the competition.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you've created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The TouchWiz-specific swiping gesture is here too - swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right to add another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign next to it deletes the redundant field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign into your Facebook or LinkedIn account. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge your contacts from those networks (you can do it manually too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard - one displays the person's contact information, while the other stores call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff - status updates and the contact's online galleries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weirdly, only the Facebook and LinkedIn SNS contacts can be synced with the phonebook - we usually see Twitter contacts in here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart dialing and video calling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam had no issues with reception even in areas with poor coverage. Sound in the earpiece was crisp and fairly loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and call log have been integrated into the phonebook, each in its own tab. Smart Dial is enabled for both names and numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only one contact (with photo) is shown at a time in the Smart Dial suggestions. You can tap the down arrow to view the rest (a digit above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also has a key for making a video call and another for sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting or holding the call, or adding another call to the conversation. There's turn-to-mute too, thanks to the accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list, while sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam earned a score of Below Average in our traditional loudspeaker test. Here's how it stacks up against the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging interface is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a New Message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an application-specific search that lets you quickly locate a message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it automatically turns it into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers a combined inbox option, which color-codes emails from different accounts for easier sorting and viewing. Conversation layout is also available - it groups related emails into single entries with a number in parenthesis showing the number of emails grouped. A tap on that entry expands it to show a list of the individual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts, and video chat support is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text entry goes, you have the standard Samsung keyboard at your disposal, with an XT9 option. Text input is quite comfortable for the range thanks to the bigger screen, and the buttons are spaced adequately enough apart so as to hit the one you want easily. Swype comes preinstalled too, and you can switch to it in the Language and Keyboard submenu of the general Settings, although it would've been more convenient to have that option in the dedicated settings of the keyboard itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gingerbread gallery and My Files<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam uses the standard Android gallery. It automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you. It displays full resolution images and supports double tap and pinch zoom. Sharing images over Bluetooth, email and MMS is enabled, and so is uploading to Picasa or using DLNA to push the image to a compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also gives you the ability to edit photos as well, allowing you to add various photo effects, as well as crop, rotate, zoom and adjust the brightness/contrast and saturation levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but efficient file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, and even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My Files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Beam uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung have enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, tracks are sorted into four categories - All, Playlists, Albums and Artists. From the settings, you can add or remove categories to set up the music player just the way you like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art has a central place in the Now Playing interface, but you can replace it with an equalizer. You can also skip songs with a sideways swipe. There's an onscreen scrubber, as well as a volume slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice feature allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search by tapping on the track title. The handset will prompt you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album and whether you want to do an Internet search, search your music library or YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music player offers quick shortcuts to play the audio over Bluetooth or DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this screen we also found a "Tag" button, which tries to identify the song and automatically fill in any missing ID3 tags (that's info about album, artist, etc.), but in our experience that came back with a negative result all too often. The "Lyrics" option in the settings didn't seem to do anything either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 8 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset still needs to be plugged in to serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player performs well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The player on the Beam can handle the most common video files - MP4, AVI (DivX, XviD) and MKV. The most notable drawback is that it does not have support for 1080p video files, as well as no DTS and AC3 audio support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the video player interface itself is fairly simple, it covers the basics. You can adjust the brightness independently of the global setting and you can stream the audio over Bluetooth or use DLNA to play the video on another device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles in various languages are supported, but you can't load them manually - the video and subtitle files must have the same name. Once loaded, you are able to adjust the text size and subtitle sync.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam fared well in our audio quality test. The smartphone was nearly perfect with an active external amplifier and quite decent when a pair of headphones was plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An active external amplifier lets the Galaxy Beam show its full potential and achieve some excellent scores. It's loudness is just above average too, so we have a very solid performance here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when headphones come into play consists of a rather big increase in stereo crosstalk, and some extra distortion. We've seen smartphones do better in this scenario, but the Beam isn't too bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam comes with a 5MP camera alongside a single LED flash. It captures photos at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. There's also a front VGA camera for video calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the same as on previous Gingerbread Galaxy devices, with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, a virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left there's the front-back camera toggle, the LED flash options and the Settings shortcut. You can replace the top two buttons, as well as add two more, for a total of four shortcuts to anything found in the Settings menu - any four, in any order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Beam has rich camera functionality - touch focus, scenes, geotagging, panoramas, smile and blink detection, effects and manual settings for things like ISO, exposure compensation and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Beam produces good quality images for a 5MP shooter. The level of detail and was satisfactory, and the noise was kept at a reasonable level. On the other hand the color reproduction is usually slightly off and there are some artifacts caused by oversharpening.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Beam joins our image quality comparison tool and will face off with the likes of the Xperia U and the LG Optimus L7. The tool's page will give you all the information you'll need on what to look for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p video recording is uninspiring<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam can capture 720p videos at 30 fps with its main camera and VGA videos with the secondary camera. The camcorder uses the exact same interface as the still camera. You can use effects in the videos, but there's no touch focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded into MP4 files with a bitrate of 12Mbps, which is pretty good for 720p resolution. The accompanying sound uses the AAC audio codec, but is mono only (64 Kbps bitrate, 44.1 kHz sampling rate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The framerate hits the 30 fps target easily and the videos are very smooth. Colors are decent, too, but the amount of resolved detail is rather low and videos look pixelated at times. This means that the Galaxy Beam is hardly the best video shooter out there, but it will do for the occasional YouTube upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample shot that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Streamlined and feature-rich connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam has quad-band support for both 3G and GSM/GPRS/EDGE networks, with HSPA (14.4 Mbps downlink and 5.76 Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's stereo Bluetooth 3.0 for fast local file transfers. Then there's Wi-Fi b/g/n support, DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and a Wi-Fi hotspot option. The AllShare app allows you to stream content to and from various devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For charging and file transfers there's a MicroUSB port and a microSD card extension.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gingerbread browser is still one of the best<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed. Its user experience is, as always, flawless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, and find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another neat trick is the browser-specific brightness setting. You can, for example, boost the brightness in the browser to comfortably view your web pages but keep the general brightness low to conserve battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Flash 11 support, but only if you download the Flash 11 app from the Play Store. Once you do this, though, you can watch YouTube videos right in the browser (videos up to 720p worked smoothly) and play Flash games too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Hubs - games, Facebook and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we've seen before - it combines your email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) and email accounts and shows all incoming messages on one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There's filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Hub lets you browse music online (with search tools, charts, lists of new releases and so on). You can preview songs (30 seconds each) and buy tracks or whole albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the Game Hub, which will quickly become your go-to place for finding new games. The titles break down into Social and Premium, and there's a news section, too. You also get to try before you buy. The nice thing about that Hub is it includes the titles by Gameloft, which are otherwise not available on the Android Market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Impressive office suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam comes with Polaris Office preinstalled - one of the most feature-rich mobile editors we've seen. You can view, edit and create Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents (Office 2003 and Office 2007 are supported) and there's a PDF viewer as well. The app enables searching through your office files just like in a file explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a large number of editing options - from font size and style, justification and bulleting options, to table styles. You can easily pick Excel functions from a list too (a feature commonly missing in mobile editors).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual organizational tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of views: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view (often referred to as Agenda view) shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It's a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. Turning the phone landscape reveals more advanced calculator functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Beam features a decent alarm clock application with a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo and Mini Diary are self-explanatory. The first app works with text only, while the Diary lets you also attach pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a To-Do app called Task and a Voice recorder for the times when you need the Beam to remind you of something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of voice, the Samsung Galaxy Beam comes with a wide array of voice-activated features. Voice command lets you tell the Beam to perform all sorts of actions, from setting alarms and reminders to calling contacts and writing emails. It is activated by a double-press on the home button.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The latest Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam managed to get a GPS lock in just under a minute without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always-cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection. Google have also recently implemented the ability to download certain sections of the map to your device, eliminating the need for an active data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Google Play app store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Beam has the latest version of Google Play. Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the end of our review, it's perhaps fitting to return to the highlight of the Samsung Galaxy Beam - the projector. We found its performance pretty good for the casual media sharing, though the low brightness and the uninspiring resolution hardly make it a great work tool. It's pretty clear that the I8530 Beam was aimed at youngsters rather than professionals and that seems like the more reasonable approach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The projector alone is enough to put the new Galaxy Beam in a niche of its own and it's really hard to compare it to any other devices on the market. So what we need to find instead is how much does the projector cost you and if it's worth it. Fortunately, we have a very fitting device that we can use for comparison: the Samsung Galaxy S Advance released this past April.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Advance has specs which are virtually identical to the Samsung Galaxy Beam - from the 480 x 800 4-inch screen though the 5MP camera all the way down to the dual-core CPU and GPU. Besides the projector, the only thing that the Beam offers which is superior is the 2000 mAh battery, compared to the 1500 mAh one found on the S Advance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, the Samsung Galaxy Beam retails for about ?425, while the S Advance can be had for about ?300, and offers a Super AMOLED screen to sweeten up the deal even further. Even the 16GB S Advance version with NFC connectivity still costs significantly cheaper than the Beam. So, it seems that the projector will currently run a little under ?100, after you subtract the cost of the extra accessories Samsung has thrown in the Beam retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9070 Galaxy S Advance</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether or not you should pay the premium depends on how often you plan to use the projector. It seems that you need to be really addicted to sharing multimedia with your buddies or need something to replace your TV to justify the difference. You shouldn't also forget that you only use the projector from time to time, but you carry a heavier and thicker device all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've come to this review simply because the Galaxy Beam is one of the smartphones that fits your "next smartphone" budget and the projector is not a must-have, then you should know that there are plenty of devices with more firepower that cost about the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, the HTC One S retails for around ?420, and offers a far more interesting specs sheet. The larger, 4.3 inch screen has a resolution of 540 x 960 pixels, and is covered with Gorilla Glass to boot. There's also a far better chipset inside, twice the internal storage of the Beam, a higher-res camera and...well, you probably get the picture by now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively you may opt to get the same performance as the Galaxy Beam at a much lower price point and choose to spend the difference on apps or accessories. Sony offers a few devices which can provide the same (projector-less) functionality as the Beam, and will go easy on your wallet as well. The Xperia P's screen size matches that of the Beam, and boasts a higher resolution. There's a metal body, a higher-res 8MP camera capable of 1080p recording, and 13 GB of user-available storage space as well (although there's no microSD). Most importantly, the Xperia P is available for only about ?320.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia P</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of our above recommendations show that there are much better buys out there than the Samsung Galaxy Beam, but there's a catch: you have to be willing to live without the projector. And if aren't you really don't have much choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is targeting a niche market with the release of the Beam, and as such faces no real competition. That being said, should you buy the Galaxy Beam for its projection capabilities? Given that purchasing a separate projector will be even more expensive than getting the Beam we'd probably say yes. But if you can, you might want to hold off a bit. Odds are the price will fall to more reasonable levels once the Galaxy Beam has been on the market for a few months and you might be able to get a much sweeter deal.</paragraph>
