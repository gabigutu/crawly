			<paragraph>N85 is the latest Nseries signing and a bulletproof spec sheet sets it right in the thick of all-in-one action. Full-house connectivity and multimedia prowess topped with a massive OLED screen to die for, Nokia N85 gives the lineup a great edge and comes out as the definitive brand-loyal upgrade. No, it will never rule the Nseries but sure has what it takes to make them tick. With the echo of the not so glorious N96 entry still lingering, we are about to see what Nokia N85 can do for the Nseries morale.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With N85 the free slots between N70 and N96 seem to be quickly running up. But that will be a minor issue for Nokia - the much bigger challenge after N85 will be finding some new tricks to upgrade the lineup with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've been over and over the Nokia N85 spec sheet and we can hardly find something the phone lacks. The stunning 2.6" OLED screen is of course the first thing to note and, what's more, it brings us directly to pretty much the closest competitor N85 will be dealing with. But more on competition a little later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All-in-one Symbian devices with a high stake on imaging (5MP and above) are not so many. That, and the N-gage flavor, more or less set the N85 against its own. One thing we need to give Nokia N85 is that on paper it delivers nearly the same as the Nseries top dog, and beats it on looks. The pricing seems less extreme this time, so we may as well call it a nice start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best thing about the N85 though is its undoubted appeal as an upgrader's choice. It seems to be the direct successor of N81 - and does a great job at that - with definitely improved handling and looks, and boosted up specs. Nokia N78 owners might also cheer the N85 for topping pretty much everything there is to top, and keeping the FM transmitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia N78 ? Nokia N81</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smaller brother - Nokia N79 - might snatch some customers with distinct styling and more affordable price. The 50 euro saving implies a smaller and inferior display. Other than that, the differences between are minor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N79</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly the true rival will be Samsung i7110. Despite coming in a different form factor, the i7110 has basically the same spec sheet and uses the very same edition of the UI. While the price of the i7110 is yet unknown, we don't believe it will be much different from the N85. However the Finn has a head start on release. In addition, having already previewed Samsung i7110, we have to admit that the Nokia ergonomics are a whole lot better. And Nokia has worked hard on not only delivering a mere handset, but a whole suite of services, that you can enjoy given that you have one of theirs - Nokia Maps, Ovi or N-gage are some of the things that come to mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i7110</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well that is the market as it stands now. Luckily we have reviews of most of the mentioned models so if you have questions about them, feel free to pay them a visit. But first stay tuned for the actual test of Nokia N85. Join us on the next page to see what the retail box hold in store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing - 8GB card inside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were delighted with Nokia N85 keeping the promise of an 8GB microSD card in the retail package. A decent two-piece handsfree set is also supplied. The keys on the remote are large and tactile enough, so you can quickly get used to operating it without even looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A TV-out and a data cable can also be found in the medium-sized box, as well as the essential DC charger. The paper load this time is as big as it gets to help Symbian newcomers. The final item in the retail package is a DVD with the required software for PC synchronization (nothing you can't download off the internet anyway).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N85 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 measures 103 x 50 x 16 mm, which adds up to a volume of 76 cc. Now, all those numbers translate into actual handling quite nicely. With the other Nokia dual-sliders in mind, the N85 is rather compact. N85 is of course a hefty piece of gear but we do appreciate the notably improved palm-friendliness over N95.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 128 g is identical to Nokia N95 8GB, which definitely is heavy but so is the feature load.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like it or not, we have to face it again. Before anyone starts worrying about our state of mind, it's good old us. And no, we didn't suddenly awake to the mind blowing aesthetics of the Nseries. But&#x2026; (Did we almost hear a collective sigh?)&#x2026; it feels like the N85 has absolutely got the point. So much so that if N81 was more like N85 we wouldn't have started it in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N81 is still all over BUT: the crammed flimsy membrane of a navigation pad is now way more refined and user-friendly, the disastrous backlighting has immensely improved and - most importantly - the offensively cheap looks are gone. Nokia N85 will hardly turn heads but it ain't a complete disaster either. Sadly, the fingerprint issue of N81 is an unfortunate heritage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill is at the top of the front panel, flanked by the N85 signature and the ambient light sensor video-call camera combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.6" OLED screen takes most of what is left of the front panel. It sure is one of the most prominent features of Nokia N85 which, as the tradition goes, will be covered in more detail towards the end of this hardware chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, seven keys encircle the Navi-wheel-enabled D-pad. The two soft keys, Symbian and clear keys are just backlit symbols in the four corners of a flat pad, much like what we got in N81 and N96.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu and clear keys lack some in terms of adequate press feedback but nothing you can't live with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is notably smaller than that of N81. Not the most comfortable we've tried, it still does look and handle better than in N81. The dedicated music keys around the D-pad are gone and we don't think they'd be badly missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only does the dual slide design render them redundant, but they were the worst bit in N81 and N96 alike, for both looks and press. The Call and End keys, and the Multimedia key are actual knobs - no flat pad - and that's by far the better approach. The red and green buttons are too thin and somewhat rigid by still better than the flat controls on the sloping edges of N81.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Navi-wheel functionality was rather badly implemented on our unit even though it is a retail version. It might have some software issues to be fixed later trough a firmware upgrade but we are quite skeptical about that. As it is now, the Navi-wheel feature is unusable and, on the rare occasions when it actually works, it's confusing rather than helpful. No wonder we kept it off for most of the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is placed on the left side of Nokia N85. Hidden under a plastic cap to keep off dust and dirt, it can easily handle the largest memory capacities available on the market. And with the 8GB card that ships with the handset you get plenty of storage right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other element of interest on the left side is the lanyard eyelet in the top corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of Nokia N85 is quite crowded with the microUSB port, 3.5mm audio jack and power key all jostling for breathing space. No, forget that, the layout is perfectly usable, except on the fairly rare occasions when you'll need both the charger cable and the headset plugged all at once. Both the power switch and the audio jack feel right at home on the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only minor issue is that none of the apertures has a protective cap, which could cause some trouble when they start filling up with dust. And you have our word this will happen sooner than later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone hosts the stereo loudspeakers on the two extreme ends, the volume rocker, the keylock switch and the dedicated camera key. We have no complaints with any of the buttons, all of which are rather comfortable to use. Due credit to the shutter key, which makes the &#x2026;hmm&#x2026; top dog N96 blush with embarrassment. The fact that there are so many controls on this side might cause some confusion but you will get over it in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the handset is completely bereft of plugs and controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone over we come upon the 5 megapixel autofocus camera lens tucked under a neat sliding cover. Next to the lens is the dual-LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A gentle press of the latch at the bottom of the rear releases the battery cover. Below it hides the 1200 mAh BL-5K Li-Ion battery. It's quoted at up to 360 hours of stand-by and 6 hours and 50 minutes of talk time, which sounds quite a promise to us. In reality it kept the phone going for about 2 days of quite a strain (about 50 photos, an hour and a half of web browsing over Wi-Fi, 20 minutes of video playback, an hour of GPS navigation, several calls and 20 minutes of music playback).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a nice new feature in recent Nokia phones that automatically enables power-saving mode once the battery starts running low. This should usually give you a bit of extra time to get a charger before your battery is completely drained.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of Nokia N85 is commendable. The fingerprint issues were duly noted and that's pretty much our only grudge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling - and finish - is a definite step up from the N81. What's more, the N85 looks way better than the Nseries top device N96, and is not nearly as steep on the price. How's that for an asset?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You know, if the facelift for the new Nseries was a charity project we'd be the first to donate. But N85 will do without our dime.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Killer display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N85 screen sure is amazing. The 2.6" QVGA OLED unit has incredible contrast that can't be matched by any TFT display. The pitch black color the N85 renders is way beyond the reach of even Apple's iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness levels are quite good though not as spectacular. This is probably one reason why the display has relatively low sunlight legibility. On the other hand the subdued brightness makes the colors even deeper and more vibrant indoors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Adequate keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sliding the Nokia N85 up reveals the alphanumeric keypad. It isn't the very definition of user-friendliness but isn't too bad either. The typing experience is by no means inferior to N96, and looks - like with all the plastic bits - are better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The subtle ridges between rows are the better approach compared to N96. Press feedback is good. There are virtually no borders between keys on the same row. That's not such big a deal given the decently sized keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone in the other direction reveals the dedicated music player/gallery/gaming keys. In fact all four keys are usable in the music player mode and the gallery. In the latter case the top and the bottom are for zooming in and out, while the middle couple controls the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two middle keys are also the only ones used for gaming. Have in mind that people with larger fingers might have some problems with the size of those keys. N96 makes better use of the upper slide, all the space available to the actual keys. On N85 the controls are ridged by a frame and squeezed into the top part of the upper slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of Nokia N85 is fairly strong, but solid enough and looking nice in the dark. Combined with the amazing display the phone is a joy to look at.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Cool looking Symbian<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 runs on the Symbian 9.3 OS with Series60 3rd Edition user interface. Feature Pack 2 comes preinstalled, bringing some visual and performance improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout is quite familiar with status icons displayed at the top of the screen and the soft key labels taking the bottom. Quite naturally, Nokia N85 also supports Active standby with two optional layouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active standby screen is a nice and convenient way of bringing shortcuts to all favorite applications to your home screen. You can even assign shortcuts to websites of your choice for quicker access. The screen can either be organized in vertical or horizontal tabs which can then be scrolled with the D-pad. If active standby is disabled the direction keys of the D-pad can also be assigned a shortcut of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby or not, you can always change the shortcuts assigned to the two soft keys to best suit your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 can automatically rotate the user interface thanks to the built-in accelerometer. In addition the UI automatically goes landscape if you slide to reveal the music player/gallery keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 also features the new and improved task manager that comes with the new FP. It is also now somewhat better looking and is appearing on top of every pop-up menu. The shortcut used in previous versions of the OS by pressing and holding the menu key still works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the S60 UI Feature Pack 2 brings some nice transition effects. The Symbian OS has been all too well known for offering little eye-candy but now it seems to be trying to catch up. It is still far from, say Apple iPhone standards, but those are too different devices for such a comparison to be fair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multimedia menu is another of the Nseries phones important features. It is launched via the dedicated key and provides quick access to the multimedia features of the handset with thematically sorted shortcuts. They appear as drop-down lists when the respective tab is selected. Those can also be freely reordered if the layout isn't your cup of tea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being one of the most important things to performance, let's have a look at the CPU unit of the N85. The handset uses a single ARM 11 369 MHz CPU with no dedicated graphic accelerator. This still fares quite well in Symbian terms, as far as UI responsiveness is concerned. The phone reacts quickly, if not instantly, to most commands across menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery however is an entirely different story. It takes about a minute to zoom in on a photo taken with the N85 very camera and that's simply ridiculous. The video playback issues are also somewhat more frequent than we would've liked. Having dealt with other Nokia phones with similar CPUs, we've those tasks handled much better. We are therefore wondering whether some software issues are troubling the N85.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N85 user-available memory extends to a little less than 85MB topped with the 8GB card that ships along. That should get you pretty much covered (not to say spoiled) for installing any software you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Customizations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The choice of menu view modes with Nokia N85 is quite extensive. You get to pick between four different options, which should have a little something for everybody. The first two are the well known 4 x 3 grid and a simple list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two available modes are the 3D V-shape and Horseshoe layouts. They do look a lot better but working with them does take time getting used to. The font sizes throughout the menus are also configurable depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your final option for customizing the UI is changing the currently active theme. There are four preinstalled themes on Nokia N85, but you are by no means limited to them only. Downloading additional ones from the internet and installing them on your N85 is quick and easy and the choices offered are endless.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has no issues<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any problems with the in-call performance of Nokia N85. Reception levels are good and there were no interferences whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, there is no preinstalled smart-dialing feature on the Nokia N85. At least the built-in voice recognition system is doing quite a good job recognizing most of the commands. It is also fully speaker independent and doesn't require prerecording of the commands. Bear in mind though, that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a name, you should set one as default or otherwise the first entry will be dialed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results from our loudspeaker test. Nokia N85 didn't quite manage to impress us here, producing only an average score. So don't put the phone too far away in a noisy environment or you might end up missing quite a lot of calls. Here is the table comparing the N85 to some of the its Nseries siblings we've put to the same test. In case you want to find out more about the test itself or a complete list of tested devices, hit the link.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Symbian devices (Nokia N85 included) have phonebooks that can basically do anything you can think of with your contacts. Storage space can potentially extend to the whole phone memory, which is impossible to deplete even if you tried intentionally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one. Personal ringtones and videos are also available for assigning. If you prefer you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors - accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers (even WLAN connections are included).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is great too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. The first two share the all too familiar intuitive editor. It has a counter of characters left to the limit of 160. An indicator in brackets is showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching from SMS to MMS is as simple as inserting some multimedia content. The phone prompts scaling down photos that are too large for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 also features the dedicated audio message editor for instant recording of audio. You can either record the message on the spot or use a sound clip from the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Delivery reports pop up on the standby screen and are then saved in a separate folder in the messaging sub-menu. When you are exiting the message editor without having sent the message, the editor prompts saving it to the Drafts folder or discarding it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, able to meet almost any emailing needs. The best part is that Nokia N85 is yet another handset that sports the ultra easy email setup we came to know in recent Nokia phones. If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your username and password to start enjoying email on the go. The phone downloads all the needed settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service (be it POP or IMAP) is set to run on the N85.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available. There is also support for attachments, signatures and generally, you can hardly think of something important that the Nokia N85 is missing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player flying high<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Barely surprising for a multimedia device, the music player of Nokia N85 is quite capable. With the huge number of supported formats you will hardly ever come across an audio file that the phone won't handle. Album art is also supported but unluckily there are no alternative skins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is automatically sorted by artist, album, genre and composer and searching tracks by gradual typing is also available. You can also create your own playlists in no time. The process of adding tracks to the library is as simple as choosing the refresh option. You can avoid that if you upload the music via the proprietary PC Suite application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets and if they seem insufficient you can create new ones in a matter of seconds. Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case a tab appears on the stand-by screen indicating the currently running track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally having dedicated music keys also helps the sonic experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality goes in the right direction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of recent Nokia handsets has quite notably improved over the previous generation. Nokia N85 makes no exception boasting the best noise and dynamic range levels among the Finns so far. The frequency response also shows improvement drawing near the best in business. The commendable stereo crosstalk reading is also worth noting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem with audio quality of Nokia N85 is the rather high distortion levels. We've seen a few worse performers than that but most of the competition blows the N85 away on this one. There go the results so you get an idea of what Nokia N85 is all about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N85 frequency response graph</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 video player can work in both portrait and landscape mode and can be switched to fullscreen. When in full screen, the soft key labels are hidden so that they don't spoil the viewing and only pop up when a key is pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you might have guessed, watching a video clip on a screen with this kind of picture quality is nothing short of great. The ample size is also more than welcome for truly enjoying your videos. Finally, the dedicated keys also contribute to the nice video handling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia N85 has a neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support and Visual radio. The latter requires internet connection and WLAN won't do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With RDS and automatic scanning however you're less likely to resort to network data transfers with Visual Radio. In addition Nokia N85 offers a direct shortcut to the online radio directory where hundreds of stations are available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM transmitter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An interesting feature of the Nokia N85 is the built-in FM transmitter. It allows you to broadcast your favorite tracks over a predefined radio frequency. Those can then be picked up by any device with an FM radio receiver in the vicinity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The signal strength of the N85 is decent, making it quite usable in a car for example. The FM transmitter application itself has a really nice and simple user interface so the handset has every chance of replacing a CD changer in your car for example.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery - n-series of extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of Nokia N85 looks simply great in 3D rotating view. The speed of photo browsing increases if you press and hold the direction buttons on the D-pad. This allows quick skipping of tons of files if you're not in the habit of cleaning up your memory every now and then. And the photos do look amazing on the OLED display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the Nseries gallery brings no changes in terms of features - pictures can be viewed in both portrait and landscape mode and zoomed in up to 8x. The zooming however as we mentioned is a real disaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have never seen a phone take so long to zoom in on a photo as this one. And you have our word, we have seen some pretty bad cases. At a speed like that, you are highly unlikely to use zoom too often. Panning is okay though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery offers a nice slide show with customizable effects and delay between slides. You can also choose the direction of the slideshow - forward or backward from the currently selected photo and the track to go with it. Music can also be switched off if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also has a very good picture tagging system. In addition to geotagging, which is automatically handled by the camera, you can add as many tags as you like to each photo and then use them as filters.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager can do it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If the gallery file-management options (which even includes sending multiple files at a time) is insufficient you can use the file manager. It allows you to do almost anything you can think of with your files. Copying, moving, creating new folders - you name it and it's a safe bet that Nokia N85 can do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new version of the useful "Search" application is also aboard Nokia N85. It has a reserved line in the active standby menu, which is hardly a surprise given how useful it is. The application itself finds almost every item in your handset containing a given keyword. From messages to settings, every bit of data is checked and then all results are displayed on the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5mp camera somewhat under par<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 2592x1944 pixels. It sports autofocus and a dual-LED flash, as well as an active lens cover. It automatically activates the camera application once you slide it open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice camera feature is geotagging, which by the way, works with videos too. GPS locks are comparatively fast so you might want to wait about a minute before your first shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key is quite nice and has nothing to do with the disastrous knob we struggled with on Nokia N96. Unlike the "multimedia flagship" (quotes quite intended), you can actually take a picture with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI of Nokia N85 is rather nice. Using our favorite tab layout, it offers extensive settings - from manual white balance and ISO sensitivity to exposure compensation, sharpness and contrast settings. Various effects are also at hand, labeled color tones. This time around it gets even better, letting you choose which settings get displayed on the toolbar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of Nokia N85 is decent but clearly not the best among them 5 mp shooters. The image processing algorithm has some issues which obviously affect picture quality. Noise is certainly excessive and there are slight traces of oversharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also tends to oversaturate colors to make them more visually appealing. While this actually looks good in some photos, in others highlight clipping is obvious, and impossible to fix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general level of resolved detail is good but not the best in the 5MP class. Quite interestingly, the noise reduction algorithm seems to be more aggressive on the fine detail than on noise itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the general results aren't as bad as the above chapter suggests. The photos do have some issues but they are quite usable. Well, not all of them, but the largest portion is just slightly below average. Here go the sample photos so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have also conducted an impromptu shootout between the Nokia N85 and its little brother - the Nokia N79. Both phones seem to have the same camera module but their image processing algorithm differs slightly. The N79 photos have somewhat more precise colors but that is almost all the difference there is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having seen that it is a close contest we threw in a third contender - the Nokia N95 8GB. The old hand took on the task with style and outclassed both the N85 and N79. Color accuracy and contrast are obviously better in N95 and so is - though not to the same extent - resolved detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, this is where we stand - if camera performance is your top priority you might be better off looking elsewhere. But again, the Nokia N85 camera isn't bad enough to ruin the whole package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And just to prove that here are a few sample photos downsized to 1024 x 768 pixels.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording on the better side<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for video recording, the N85 camera shoots in VGA resolution at the sweet 30fps. Sounds like really good quality and it very well is. There is more than enough res and the frame rate makes sure it isn't a nuisance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in MPEG-4 format and can have automatic or manual white balance. The other available settings are night mode, exposure and color effects. You can also choose whether the dual-led flash should be turned on to act as a video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connecting people<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is surely one of the elements of the Nokia Nseries models and the N85 is hardly an exception to the rule. In fact the phone supports all contemporary data transfer means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 are a nice start of the lengthy list. All kinds of network connectivity are also on board - from ageing GPRS, through EDGE to 3G with HSDPA - the N85 has it all covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100Mhz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should definitely check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To complete the wireless communication tally, Wi-Fi with UPnP support is also at hand. A nice improvement coming with the FP 2 now allows for adding hidden wireless networks with the nice WLAN scanner right on the stand-by screen. This was also available in previous Nokia handsets but took a lot more time, as the WLAN wizard had to be used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia N85 has a memory card slot, which can at times provide the fastest data transfer rates. And with an 8GB card in the retail package all you need is a card reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser good as always<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 comes complete with an elaborate browser to make use of the great connectivity set. The browser has excellent page rendering and works in both portrait and landscape mode. The zoom level is easily controlled and the font size can be modified to fit as much content as possible on a single page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual mouse cursor earns the browser another point. It is easy to control and generally works great. A mini-map can be activated to help finding your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the optical joystick in Samsung i7110 and i8510 INNOV8 is the highest we have seen a Symbian browser go, the Nokia N85 isn't too far from that standard.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Limitless organizing capabilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones can hardly be accused of lacking time-management skills. Even if you do happen to miss an application you need on your Nokia N85 - there is plenty of third party software out there. However for most everyday use you will hardly need anything more than the package you get straight out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has the typical three different view modes - monthly, weekly and daily, and four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word and Excel, PDF and PowerPoint files seamlessly. Unluckily, editing documents is not supported by the included Quickoffice version. If you would like editing enabled you will have to get the complete application from the Nokia Download center for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other office application is ZIP manager, which allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other included organizing and time-management applications are a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go. This is quite convenient for, say, setting up your wake-up alarm. In addition, the number of alarms is not limited.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ngage gaming: cash is king<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We still look at Nseries handsets as smartphones but they are probably more important to Nokia as N-gage phones. It's all about mobile content sales and trial-to-purchase-conversion counts big time. No wonder our N85 unit was quite loaded. You also get one full-featured game as a taster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can of course download some free games at the Nokia download center but those aren't as good as the N-gage titles. There are also plenty of third-party games out there, so Nokia N85 users can easily download both native and java titles.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS does OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 has a built-in GPS receiver and comes with three months of free voice guided navigation. Sounds like a serious premise for reasonable use as a dedicated navigation unit. The chip sensitivity might be an issue here as it isn't the best we have seen on a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It took the phone about two and a half minutes to get satellite lock upon cold start and that is way off Nokia N78 or even Nokia N96. However, on most occasions, this kind of speed might seem perfectly adequate to use. In addition A-GPS might take down this time to a more acceptable level. After all, if a couple of minutes are so important you might as well spend a few extra cents on data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in GPS receiver works with Nokia Maps, which is one of the navigation applications to offer the most detailed maps. Furthermore, it is free and relatively easy to use. You will have to buy the voice-guided navigation license once your three-month free trial expires. At least the actual purchase itself is quite simple directly via the phone interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Maps application itself is doing pretty well in terms of features too. It has four different view modes including satellite and hybrid maps. Those however do need an internet connection to be available. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Route selection can be set to either fastest or shortest. The app is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional features like traffic information and city guides can also be activated but they come for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in case you are still unhappy with Nokia Maps you can go for a third-party application and there are quite a lot of those available. User reports indicate the internal GPS has no problem working with any of the more popular third-party navigation apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall impression with GPS navigation on Nokia N85 is rather positive but not as good as most other recent Nokia GPS-enabled models. The quick initial lock of the Nokia N78 really impressed us but if you can live without it the rest is basically the same. The large screen is also a benefit but still not up to standalone navigator standards.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The good thing Nokia N85 does is take (almost) all the Nseries have delivered to date and put it in a neat and tasteful package. There are no groundbreaking novelties but what you get is quite worth it. And the display? well you do need to see it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N85 didn't hit the market so bitterly overpriced as the N96. Nor was the wait so hyped - instead it almost instantly felt right where it belongs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the N85 certainly doesn't have the best 5MP camera on the market or the best styling there is, it is certainly one of the best all-rounders we've encountered. There is virtually no aspect of its performance where it totally fails (okay, zooming in the gallery is not that important).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And - having said all that - the best thing about Nokia N85 is it can tempt both Symbian newcomers and upgraders. It's quite a list of phones that can lose their owners' favor to N85.</paragraph>
