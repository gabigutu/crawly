			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>But while flagship phones are the attention-grabbers, the midrange is the bread and butter, in both old and emerging markets. ZTE doesn't have to be reminded of that, having long tapped markets such as China and India. And we're not talking Android One level of competition either. More and more compelling offers are now available below the $200 mark that are known to deliver reasonably high build quality, adequate performance and up-to-date software features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 is aiming even higher - in terms of both price bracket and level of equipment. A clear attempt to cater to cost-conscious but advanced users who need above-average specs and capable hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blade S90 is powered by a Snapdragon 615, the same chipset that's ticking inside the likes of the HTC Desire 820, the Oppo R5 and even half of the Samsung Galaxy A7's. Four of eight Cortex A53 cores are clocked at 1.7GHz, the rest at 1GHz. The GPU is Adreno 405 and the whole thing makes use of 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera setup on the Blade S6 also looks quite impressive. A 13MP primary unit with LED flash is backed by a 5MP front-facer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of connectivity the ZTE Blade S6 is a dual-SIM LTE-enabled smartphone. It also offers Wi-Fi ac and Bluetooth v4.0 connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the Blade S6 comes with Android 5.0 out of the box, placing it among a select few devices, especially the ones coming from China.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Designwise, the ZTE Blade S6 has iPhone 6 written all across, including a cheeky "Designed by ZTE in California" inscription on the gray-painted, curvy body. The camera placement is also borrowed from Apple - it is impossible to not notice the similarities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 is entering a market niche with tough competition. The Apple-inspired design could be anything between a key selling point and a major turn off. There may be a market for Android-powered iPhone 6 replicas but these are coming by the dozen from shady brands anyway and ZTE should be better than that. The Blade S6 can always point to the Lenovo Sisley for an excuse but we won't take it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note, ZTE has secured capable internals to make the Blade S6 a tempting package. If the price is right and they deliver speed, performance and image quality, to go with the pleasantly surprising Lollipop, they'll manage to put some pressure on the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll know soon enough. Coming up next is the usual unboxing and hardware checkup. Let's do this.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 comes in a simple but stylish rectangular white box. What's inside is nothing out of the ordinary - the thing to note is the missing headset, but we've seen it omitted in even more expensive bundles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compact packaging is nicely organized and has two separate smaller compartments under the phone holder. One contains a 1000 milliamp A/C adapter, while the other has a data cable, a short user manual and an ejector pin for the SIM and microSD compartments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 is stylishly simple - which is nice - but the design may look to be blatantly copied. Don't worry, from a distance, it might fool an untrained eye but upon closer inspection, the Blade S6 bears little actual similarity to the high-end iPhone 6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera lens is sitting flush on the back without protruding in any way. The 7.7mm thick ZTE Blade S6 had just enough room to do what a 6.9mm iPhone 6 couldn't. Another thing that becomes quickly apparent is that ZTE has decided to go with an all plastic body. This may not be nearly as premium as an alloy unibody, but it does help the 144 x 70.7 x 7.7mm phone tip the scales at a pretty lightweight 134g. There was no need for additional plastic accents either to aid signal reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides being a little heavier, the Blade S6 is also bigger than the iPhone in every dimension, but it does also offer a slightly larger screen at 5 inches, compared to Apple's 4.7" diagonal. All and all, the Blade S6 feels very comfortable in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall shape and curved slides are pretty much the same as the ones on the iPhone and so is the matte finish. The front of the ZTE is pure white and very subtly curved around the edges of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device currently comes in two colors - the "white" or platinum we currently have and a matte pink version which, by the looks of it, is rather glossy. A bit like a shiny version of the iPhone 5c.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 feels quite good in the hand and also pretty sturdy. There are no apparent build quality blunders, everything is nicely put together with no cracks or rough edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as materials go, the plastic in question feels good to the touch, but does bend slightly in when pressed. It might be that it is too thin or just quite flexible, but it does give in if you press near the ZTE logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this line of thought, there seem to be a few hollow areas at the back of the Blade S6, but this is no big deal and was perhaps necessary to accommodate the camera sensor, without anything protruding.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Blade S6 boasts a 5" 16M-color display with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels. It is an IPS LCD panel and colors are a little bit washed away, but it is by no means horrible and gets the job done. The bezels around it are quite thin and the Blade offers a pretty good screen-to-body ratio of 67.7%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, the earpiece is flanked by the proximity and ambient light sensors, and the front-facing camera. Right underneath it we find three capacitive buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The center one is essentially a blue ring, which flashes a nice blue light to indicate notifications, charging or to simply respond to taps. The other couple of buttons are denoted by simple small dots of the same color. The absence of specific icons suggests the default setting (the left one serves as a menu button, while the right one is back) can easily be changed, which is a nice little touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going round the device we find two very similar slots on the left side. They are both nicely rounded to fit the shape of the curved side. The top one holds the two nanoSIM cards, while the bottom is for the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is where the volume rocker and Power/Lock button are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is placed on the top of the device near the left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone only features a microUSB port and a microphone. No speakers or screws are to be seen like on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going round the back, we find the 13MP camera lens in the top left corner with a single LED flash right next to it. It seems ZTE has opted to move as much stuff as possible away from the sides and on to the back panel. On the right side of the camera lens, keeping with the aforementioned vertical alignment there is a very tiny hole, which houses the second noise-cancelling mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Near the bottom, right beneath the inscription, we find a small speaker grille. A rear-mounted speaker can get easily muffled and the one on the ZTE Blade S6 has a microscopic leg, which should be enough to give the speaker some breathing air when the phone is laying on its back on a flat surface.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 is equipped with a 5-inch LCD IPS display with 720 x 1280px resolution. Not impressively sharp but perfectly alright at 294ppi. Colors are a little washed out and could definitely be more vivid, but the display is still pretty nice although a little bit too reflective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen itself is slightly curved towards the edges, like the one on the Moto X (2014), which you can actually feel in end-to-end horizontal swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 uses a standard RGB matrix in its LCD panel. With a pixel density of 294 there is nothing really too impressive with the panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as contrast goes numbers are adequate, but equally unimpressive. It is not particularly bright and seeing how it is a simple LCD, blacks are not very deep either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is rather disappointing and not on par with current devices, mainly due to the low maximum brightness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery Life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 packs a 2,400mAh battery. Due to the unibody design it is non-removable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone did okay in our traditional battery test, scoring an overall endurance rating of 51 hours, which is adequate, though hardly impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A talk time of 15 hours is perfectly ok. The Blade S6 really falls behind in terms of web-browsing endurance and multimedia playback, hence the low overall score. Standby is also rather battery-draining.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes the standby battery draw, but it is not featured in our battery scorecard even though it is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of power management, the Blade S6 can reap the benefits of having the Android 5.0 battery manager. It offers a far better overview on usage and very detailed statistics to pinpoint power-hungry and misbehaving processes. ZTE has opted not to deviate from the stock behavior and has only a basic power-saving mode available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is pretty standard and reduces performance a bit by limiting background data and turning off various features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Blade S6 comes equipped with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band 3G with HSPA (up to 42Mbps of downlink and 5.7Mbps of uplink). The Cat. 4 LTE band support in the Snapdragon 615 (up to 150Mbps download, and up to 50Mbps uploads) is not the best around, but it was probably the LTE multimode (multi-SIM) that was of utmost importance to ZTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone offers dual SIM support and has a dedicated SIM manager in the settings menu. It lets you choose which SIM card is active and the default SIM to use for placing voice calls, data traffic or messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by a single-stream Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac as well as Bluetooth 4.0. GPS and GLONASS support is enabled. There's an FM radio, but no NFC or Infrared on board.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface - Slightly skinned Lollipop<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 runs the latest Android 5.0 out of the box, which is a definite rarity among Chinese devices. ZTE has slapped its own launcher on top of the OS, but thankfully, it preserves most of the Lollipop feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The launcher itself is very clean and simplistic. It goes for a nice flat design UI, complete with modern-looking flat icons with nicely rounded corners. The whole User experience is very straight forward and unobtrusive. Menus are not overly stuffed and well organized with almost everything where you would expect it to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few ZTE additions to stock Android functionality, but everything is well executed with no extra clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a quick walkthrough of ZTE's custom android work in the video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the lockscreen, ZTE has opted for a slide-up unlock approach, which moves notifications upwards over the rest of the interface. It also features a time and date widget and two shortcuts to the dialer and camera on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen, we find a fairly standard Android homescreen with up to 18 homescreen panes available at your disposal. That's a lot of space, but since ZTE has opted out of using a conventional app drawer, it might just come in handy. With no app drawer, anything you install pops up on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can group the apps in folders, which look a lot like stock Lollipop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, a long press on the homescreen gets you to the management screen - from there, you can rearrange, delete and add panes. There are no dedicated add or delete buttons in the menu. Instead, there is always an extra empty screen that appears in the management area and if something is placed on it, it becomes active as a new screen. Removing it is the reverse procedure. This is kind of a chore and it definitely could use some remodeling from ZTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Menu button on the homescreen gives you quick access to color schemes, wallpapers, effects and launcher settings. The Blade S6 comes preloaded with a few wallpapers as well as a lot of nice solid-color options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough, there is an online library for additional colors to be downloaded. It may sound kinda odd, but it does double as a link to more wallpapers. Speaking of, you can add a blur filter if varying intensity to any wallpaper, which is definitely a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu also contains an effects tab that lets you choose between a few nice transition animations between screens. Subtle and yet excellent to keep the experience fresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab contains a link to the main phone setting as well as what appears to be a settings menu for the launcher itself, with options for backing up and restoring. This is also the home of one of three rather confusing update features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we are on the subject of updating ZTE has created a rather confusing mess of the whole process. As already mentioned, there are three separate places within the menu structure where an update option is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, there is the standard System updates located under "About phone". This option, however does not connect to a remote server but instead is intended for manual updates off the SD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This placement is a little bit strange, but things get even weirder. ZTE offers a separate System update application which is where you want to go for OTA packages. However, it also has a backup and restore feature that works with the external storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but not least, there is the aforementioned update in the Launcher options. We can't really figure out if this is a separate feature, which is responsible solely for keeping the UI up to date or whether it's a shortcut to the OTA center. Either way, the Blade S6's update system is a hassle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area on the Blade S6 is what you would normally expect from Android 5.0. Pulling it down once reveals the notifications, which are nicely animated in a list fashion. Right above them there is the standard time and date widget along with a battery indicator and what is supposed to be Android Lollipop's new profile manager and selector. However, it does not seem to do anything on the S6 for some reason. Perhaps it's just our review unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pulling down a second time reveals the quick toggles, eight to be precise, selected dynamically according to usage patterns, as well as a brightness slider, as well as a battery percentage indicator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Blade S6 has no trouble with responsiveness whatsoever and the Snapdragon 615 breezes through menus with ease, save for one notable exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For whatever reason adjusting the brightness is a very laggy process, which seems to stutter the whole UI. Perhaps it is a software issue or the hardware controller responsible for adjusting light levels is just too slow and freezes the device for a split second. Whatever the reason the bug is a fact, but definitely nothing more than a minor nuisance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blade S6 also borrows the interesting Lollipop notification management and prioritizing system, which enables you to adjust limit certain types of notifications based on their source or all of them together, instead of simply turning off the volume all together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long tap on the Menu capacitive key reveals the app switcher. It is also stock Android all over and has a neat card interface that allows you to select the app you need by swiping up or down. You can close apps by swiping left or right, or by hitting the dedicated button on the top right corner of each card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard navigation scheme and Android shortcuts, ZTE has thrown in some additional Gestures in the Blade S6. They are managed through a dedicated "Gestures and Motion" app and cove a wide array of use cases. Some of these make a lot of sense and work well, while others are just plain silly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Covering or flipping the phone can silence a notification or incoming call, which is definitely useful to have and so is the dedicated pocket mode, that ramps up vibration and ringer volume. There are however a few motion gestures that use the volume rockers and are kind of hit and miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding the volume up and bringing the phone horizontally in front of your face should fire the main camera, while doing the same while holding the device vertically should bring up the selfie camera, or at least in theory. We couldn't get either to work properly. The same applies for auto answer and auto call, which are intended to do the respective actions when you bring the device up to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a shake gesture that can launch apps quickly from locked state. A nice idea which also works reliably enough, but the app selection is limited to the flashlight and calculator and we can already imagine the battery drain from accidental misfires in the pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding the home button brings up Google Now. Google Now has brand new material design, but its functionality hasn't changed much. You can manage your daily routine and all your interests by using the service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It knows your upcoming flights and hotel reservations. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the best part about the Android 5.0 Lollipop-based user interface of the Blade S6 is that it truly feels new, well-polished and very clean. The new ART runtime is a huge deal too - it's supposedly responsible for the excellent performance and makes interaction with the device feel a lot more immediate. Getting the latest Android experience out-of-the box is a huge deal especially for a Chinese manufacturer and ZTE definitely deserves admiration for the extra effort.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 sports the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 chipset equipped with four Cortex-A53 cores, clocked at 1.7 GHz and another four at 1.0 GHz. It is backed up by 2GB of RAM and comes with 16 GB of onboard storage, which is extendible through a microSD card. The accompanying GPU is the modest Adreno 405.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This particular hardware setup is quite good, especially for a sub $300 phone. It does not seems to be particularly popular, with only a few other adopters, like the Oppo R5, HTC Desire 820 and soon the Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro. It does, however offer an impressive price to performance ration and brings current technologies and standards in a budget package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 615 offers a quite capable octa-core CPU setup which might not be up to par with the advanced features of the recent 800 series Qualcomm chips, but is nonetheless, the top offering from the 600 series. It has 64-bit support, which is a must, given Android's recent move towards the generally better-performing architecture, so it is pretty much an investment in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 405 will also happily handle most current graphics-intense game you can throw at it and comes fully equipped to handle LTE ant Cat. 4 speeds of up to 150 Mbps. Few budget-friendly devices can boast such an impressive package, but let's look at benchmark scores and let the numbers speak about the internals of the Blade S6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, we have the raw CPU performance test with GeekBench 3, so things should be pretty straight-forward in this department. Unsurprisingly, the Xiaomi Mi 4, the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Huawei Honor 5 steal the show with their Snapdragon 801 and HiSilicon Kirin 920, respectively. Interestingly enough, the HTC Desire 820 outperforms the Blade significantly, despite having much the same hardware and so does the Oppo R5. This might be due to some optimization issues with Android Lollipop, but overall, it seems ZTE could have done a better job optimizing the otherwise capable hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This however does not meant that the Blade S6 is not doing well, especially in its own price gap, where the Sony Xperia C3 and Motorola Moto G (2014) are lacking behind in number-crunching capabilities.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Antutu 5, however is a whole different story. In it the Blade S6 shows a significantly higher score and takes its rightful place among the Oppo R5 and HTC Desire 820.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keeping this in mind, the previous underwhelming GeekBench results might be an app-specific issue as all other benchmarks do the Snapdragon 615 justice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Advancing further to the slightly broader Basemark OS II test, we see much the same. The overall score places the ZTE Blade S6 around the middle of the table with only slight deviations from its direct competitors. Interestingly enough, its single-core performance is quite impressive, even surpassing the Oppo R5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blade S6 did get rather hot during testing and a lot of the performance drops might be due to throttling, which might explain the slightly lower-than-expected scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single core performance on the other hand king of disproves this hypothesis, as the phone did a lot better, so the only culprit seems to be Android 5.0. After all, it is only natural that the new ART virtual machine and the enormous amount of changes in APIs and behavior result in some difference in benchmarking applications. This might be the reason behind some of the odd scores.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As already mentioned, the ZTE Blade S6 comes equipped with an Adreno 405 GPU which delivers decent performance at a budget price. Looking at the graphics tests, everything looks nice and straightforward. The device puts out almost identical frame rates to the Desire 820 and Oppo R5, which share its GPU, just as expected. Onscreen performance on the Oppo is around half of the other two, which is also absolutely in line with the fact that it has a Full HD screen, whereas the others offer only HD resolutions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, the Galaxy S5 and Xiaomi Mi4 dwarf the Blade with their Adreno 330 GPU, but interestingly enough, looking at other offers from the sub $300 range it seems that the ZTE easily surpasses the competition in both onscreen and offscreen performance. All and all, the Adreno 405 is a rare find on a sub-$300 device, which deserves an honorable mention.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 punches well above its league in terms of browser performance. It pretty much towers above the competition, with the notable exception of the Oppo R5. It however has Chrome as its default browser, which might just give it the extra edge. The Blade S6 also has Google's browser preloaded, but uses the Android one by default, so testing was done using it.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Performance-wise the ZTE Blade S6 is definitely a neck above its competition. It packs quite the punch for a $250 phone and is almost without competition as far as price to performance is concerned. While the device has its shortcomings, performance is definitely not one of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equipped with a 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 615 CPU and 2GB of RAM, it is more than safe for any android update in the foreseeable future. And if having Lollipop out-of-the box is any representation of ZTE's Future support plans, then it should be able to stay relevant on the market for quite some time.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook application on the ZTE Blade S6, just like many others, is lifted straight from stock Android Lollipop with little change. The app features a clean tabbed interface, which displays all contacts and the favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a Multi-select option it the app menu on the Blade S6 that seems to be missing from Nexus devices, but everything else is identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts including Google and Exchange. A button to add a new contact is constantly present in the bottom right corner - you can choose which account to sync the new addition with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing contacts is equally intuitive and fluent. It is achieved in a stylish material manner. Missing profile pictures are replaced by solid color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the interface is really pleasant to work with and using stock apps really fits well with the whole clean, solid-color flat style of the whole ZTE launcher.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default phone application of the Blade S6 is again borrowed from the Nexus family. It definitely looks great with its metro design and abundance of transitions and animations. Its functionality however, is still a familiar affair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Launching the app brings you to the speed dial section, combined with a shot log of recent calls right above it. You can open the dialer at any time - it is readily available via a button at the bottom of the screen. You can also browse contacts without firing up the dedicated app from the third tab in the navigation bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have three tabs to choose from - speed dial, recent calls, and you phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-call screen features solid color and sleek animation. Its layout is easy to read and operate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Call quality on the ZTE Blade S6 is excellent. We had no trouble during testing and everything came out nice and clear. The noise cancelation system is also pulling its own weight ensuring pretty good background noise suppression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blade S6 has quite an impressive speaker. Despite its small size and rather odd positioning it is quite loud and very clear. You shouldn't have any problems hearing it ring.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You have two options to handle you texts out of the box - Google Hangouts and the stock messenger app. This is a relatively new feature for Hangouts which allows you to handle all messaging through a single app that is if you are an avid Hangouts user. ZTE has also included a more traditional messaging solution set by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't help but notice that unlike the rest of the GUI it was not executed in the flashy material design style. The app might have been lifted from a previous OS version, as it is HOLO through and through. This is not a bad thing, but it does stand out as a patch on the otherwise fluent user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. The application kindly allows you to attach different media files, automatically switching to MMS format to handle the delivery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To handle emails the ZTE Blade S6 offers Gmail preloaded as well as a dedicated email app. This is kind of redundant, seeing how the latest version of Google's mail client can now work with any mail account, Google or not and is now the only email client you will need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A button to start a new message sits at the top right bottom of the app. The composition screen holds no surprises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alternative ZTE email application looks and behaves extremely similar to the Gmail app. It does however lack one important feature - Google support - so we really don't see the point in the doppelganger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as keyboards go, the Blade S6 comes preloaded with TouchPal. It is rather interesting and offers some advanced features like clipboard management and a wide array of emoji art and mood icons. If you are not into the whole emoticon thing there is also the stock Android keyboard available. It stretches nicely on the 5" display and allows for a really quick typing. You can enhance it even further by turning on the Gesture typing.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The gallery app on the ZTE Blade S6 looks plain and straightforward enough, but underneath its simple black exterior, there are a multitude of quite interesting features that definitely deserve to be mentioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Launching the app brings you to a simple tiled interface of the various albums on your device. Images can, however, be sorted according to a multitude of criteria. Location, time and even custom tags can be used for sorting or everything can simply be placed in a long list, if that is your preference. The app also handles videos, but filters them out of the view by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open up an album, images are displayed in a tiled fashion four in each column with horizontal scrolling. This grid view can be changed to what ZTE calls "Film". It place a single larger image thumb in the frame and again enables horizontal scrolling. Pinch zooming can both exit this preview and focus on a single image and also bring you back to it if you zoom out enough, which definitely makes for a straightforward and intuitive experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also comes with two additional features to spice-up you photo collection. First up, we have a Collage maker, which is exactly what it sounds like. The option comes with nice interface that allows you to choose templates, borders, shadings and even freely rearrange images to get the desired effect. Perfect for summing up a trip in a few shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other feature of interest is the bundled GIF maker. It allows you to quickly stitch together photos into an animated sequence with adjustable speed and save it as a .gif file. Another nice little touch from ZTE and actually quite amusing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but not least, the Blade S6 allows you to edit photos straight from the gallery. The editor itself is surprisingly packed with features, ranging from trivial cropping and effects all the way up to fine-tuning colors and applying different blurs. It is definitely more than accurate for quickly fixing up a photo before uploading it online.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 comes with a dedicated video application. It offers a quite basic interface and few advanced features, but definitely gets the job done. One apparent nuisance is that the app tries to index all of the videos on the device and does not do a particularly good job when it comes to finding files on the SD card. Swapping out the card only exacerbates the problem. The player itself does offer Hi-Fi support as well as a very interesting pop-out mode which spawns a small draggable video window on top of the UI. And it actually works pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as format support goes, the Blade S6 didn't have any issues with playing every video we threw at it, regardless of the video encoder used. It refused to play a videos with AC3 audio, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio on board, but sadly no RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a built-in radio in the Blade. It is fairly straight-forward with nothing too flashy or advanced in terms of looks and functionality. There is a favorites function, of course, but sadly no RDS support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Feature rich audio player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ZTE has apparently put a lot of work into the multimedia experience on the Blade S6. Just like the gallery, the default music player is packed to the brim with features and offers and experience that even the most-picky audiophile should find pleasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting the app brings up a straight-forward interface that looks simple enough, but again there is a lot more to it than meets the eye. We can clearly see a pattern developing here and we do like it. Most of the aforementioned apps are really designed with user experience in mind. With practically no learning curve beginners can easily find their way around, while there is a lot more hidden away under the hood for those willing to tinker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the right takes you to the current playlist and swiping left brings out the lyrics to what is currently playing. It does, of course, require an active network connection, but no more searching for the words to that one song you particularly like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the main interface gives you a list of even more interesting options like reading the ID3 info, assigning the track as a ringtone or to a particular contact and even cutting a particular part out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few more goodies hidden away in the music app. Browsing through your audio library is complimented by an extra tab that allows you to purchase music online. Last, but not least there is something ZTE calls "Music hunter" inside the app menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it essentially does is recognize songs through audio analysis in much the same way Shazam does, for example. Having it easily accessible and baked right inside the audio player is definitely yet another nice touch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 may be a mere mid-ranger, but its audio quality is flagship material. Loud and clear, the smartphone can handle some pretty powerful headsets and still deliver crisp audio output making sure all tracks will sound the way they are meant to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone did perfectly in the first part of our audio quality. When connected to an active external amplifier, the Blade S6 delivers perfectly clean output at high volume levels - up there with the best in the mobile world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Better yet, when you plug in a pair of headphones the only distortion is a minor amount of extra stereo crosstalk. Overall the output is still about as smooth as they come and volume remains ever so high - a really impressive overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see the details for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good camera with weird software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 features a 13MP camera with a single LED flash and a maximum resolution of 4128 x 3096 pixels in 4:3 mode. It can also shoot in 16:9, but photos are cropped to 4096 x 2304 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing shooter is nothing really impressive at 5MP, but gets the job done. It does go all the way up to 1080p in terms of video resolution and pictures come out fairly clear. The Blade S6 is rather surprisingly poor on selfie features and gesture controls that have become so popular lately. The front camera only has two options to pick from. Beauty face, which smooths out colors and, but not in a particularly natural way and also smile detection, which was hit and miss for most of the time during or tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the S6's camera app is confusing to say the least. It seems ZTE has decided to apply its simple basic features with more options hidden away ideology here too, but might have taken things a bit too far. If you are content with just aiming the phone and shooting on auto, with an occasional panorama or HDR, then the so called "simple mode" will be all you even need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If, however, you wish to tinker with some more advanced settings, they are all there, but hidden away in the expert mode. Switching to it definitely requires an inside tip. Honestly, we almost missed it during our testing and it was completely by chance that we decided to press an ambiguous red circle positioned on the left hand side of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once tapped, it goes blue and spawns a toast notification informing you that you are among the select few who have stumbled upon the secret. Expert mode changes almost every app menu completely. Most notably, it displays toggles for the level meter, screen guidelines and allows for fine tuning of ISO, exposure and white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also swaps out the settings menu with one that actually lets you adjust the resolution of your photos and features like geotagging. A nasty consequence is that in expert mode you can no longer reach the special shooting modes or the image filters, so it's definitely a tradeoff. On the plus side camera options are plentiful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blade S6 comes with a few special shooting modes. There are, of course, Normal and Auto, but also Panorama, Beauty, Smile, Photo clear, Group and Straighten. Most are self-explanatory. Photo clear is used for fast-moving objects and Group takes a few quick snaps and stiches them together for the best possible group shots. Straighten allows you to straighten images horizontally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blade S6 does come with an HDR option, bet there appears to be a significant software bug with it, as despite our best effort, the phone failed to shoot a nice-looking HDR image, but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Capture quality on the ZTE Blade S6 is far from spectacular. Most photos came out quite noisy. Even worse, quite often the exposure and the colors were off, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many of our test samples came out with a part of the image blurry, which suggests a lens-specific issue on our review unit. Surprisingly, the rest of the samples were just fine with excellent edge-to-edge sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At times, the camera app froze on us when attempting to capture consecutive shots quickly. We guess, you would be better off using a third-party camera app. Coincidentally or not, ZTE has preloaded the phone with Camera360, which is definitely a solid alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP front-facing camera produced a nice looking photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Blade S6 managed to get close to subjects and offers detailed macro images. Quality is pretty good but manual focus seems to be playing a trick or two to the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each manufacturer has their own way of dealing with HDR photography. High dynamic range shots aim to expose both the highlights and the shadows of a scene correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE snaps multiple images with different exposures and merges them to create its HDR shots - but that's on paper. As already mentioned, the Blade S6 suffers from what we presume is a software bug which renders HDR all but useless. When shooting outside, it was only able to produce extremely over-exposed all-white snaps. We had better luck indoors, but the HDR effect is too extreme for our liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried out other camera applications, hoping that the default camera app was to blame, but it seems that the low-level software of the camera is the culprit. In any case it should be fixable fairly easy, so ZTE just needs to act on the problem and while they're at it, perhaps give the camera UI a much-needed reorganizing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 can shoot panoramas in both portrait and landscape mode. Shooting one is easy and straightfoward. Results are also very pleasant with almost no noticeable stitching or any other artifacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, we shot our test posters with the Blade S6 and here's how it fared, compared against the Samsung Galaxy A5 and the HTC Desire 820. Of course, our tool allows you to compare it against any other smartphone that we've shot with.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video is fine, but nothing spectacular<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 can record 1080p videos at around 30fps. There is also a High Frame Rate option as well as Time lapse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not a whole lot you can adjust in terms of video settings. Actually the options only go as far as resolution and toggling the two aforementioned special modes. The Blade S6 also offers the option to shoot video in HDR mode, but the final result is indistinguishable from a normal video so perhaps it's again the camera software to blame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos taken with the ZTE look good, but are not spectacular in any way. The level of resolved detail is ok, the white balance and colors are fine too. The videos look smooth with a framerate of about 29-30fps. Edge-to-edge sharpness is good, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have a bitrate of 20Mbps and their stereo audio track in encoded in 96Kbps 2 channel AAC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera auto focus kept hunting which got annoying at times. High framerate videos are captured at 720p resolution, which is fine, but despite our best efforts, we could not get the Blade S6 to focus properly in this mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below you can find the 1080p video sample along with a video sample shot with HFR enabled.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 comes with its own version of the stock Android browser, as well as Google's Chrome browser and the relatively popular UC Mini browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock browser packs the usual features: Incognito tabs, Bookmarks, Find in page and Desktop view. There is no Flash support. Pages can be saved locally to read offline, but videos cannot. There is nothing really extraordinary to see here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is becoming the most popular mobile browser and should be fairly familiar. It has some advantages over its vanilla-flavored buddy, including switching between tabs from the Lollipop's Task Switcher interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to your Google account, Chrome can sync the tabs you have open on other devices (desktops, tablets) with the phone. This feature also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites and can remember passwords and login data across different platforms.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ZTE has crammed a lot of software into the Blade S6 out of the box. A lot of it, as already mentioned, is stock Android, like the dialer, contacts, calendar, alarm and others, but there are a few third-party apps on board. Some even appear to be designed specifically for the S6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An example of this is the ZTE-exclusive AliveShare social networking app. Once launched, it presents a simple and tidy interface, which allows you to connect to other app users and partake in all sorts of mutual activities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is quite an interesting concept actually. You can create groups of users both locally, if you are on the same network, or over an internet connection. Once gathered in a group, users can easily share files with each other, chat, and even play supported multiplayer games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting feature within the app is the ability to easily migrate your things from one phone to another with a single click. All and all, the AliveShare application offers an intriguing array of features, especially if you know a lot of people who use ZTE Android smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rather oddly, ZTE has also included another dedicated Backup and Restore app with mostly the same features as mentioned above. It can migrate your contacts and application data across phones quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another quite interesting app found on the Blade S6 is Mi-POP. Launching it places a bubble with quick access controls, which stays present hovering on the screen across the entire phone's interface. It is quite convenient for one-handed operation and offers a lot of customization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default clicking the bubble once acts like a Back button, but it can also be set to mimic a press on a home button. Holding it down reveals a few buttons for quick access to stuff like locking the screen, muting and powering off the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding and swiping the bubble brings out three more controls for even quicker access to the navigation controls without having to reach for the physical buttons at the bottom of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 comes with a fairly advanced task manager. It allows you to easily manage active processes as well as get a comprehensive view of system resources and their current usage. There is a shortcut to close all active apps for quickly clearing up the memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app is taken straight from stock Android Lollipop and definitely looks nice. The clean flat design with nice solid colors really creates a classy, refined feeling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator also looks nice with big round buttons. So do other productivity apps, like the Calendar and NotePad. They even share most of their color scheme, but again their look and feel is more retro, HOLO-style, than modern Material Lollipop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of handling documents the ZTE Blade S6 comes equipped with WPS Office. It is not the most popular office application out there, but is fairly capable and can easily handle Word, Excel, PowerPoint as well as PDF's, so it's an all-in-one solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a very intuitive file manager. It automatically groups things according to type, but also allows traditional folder browsing, as well as searching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the default navigation app, but it's most useful when used while you are online. It allows you to download offline maps of an area and even plan routes without a data connection but you can't search for addresses or POIs without an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once online, it can plan driving, public transport, cycling and walking routes. It can also display pretty accurate traffic alerts as well (though it doesn't always take them into account when routing you).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another great support tool available on all Android smartphones is the Android Device Manager. It's available for all Android devices linked to your Google account. It can help you find your misplaced ZTE by making it ring or showing you its location on a map. If it's stolen, you also have the option to lock the device and even wipe all data. You need to enable this option on the device however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, Google's Play Store hardly needs any description. It the biggest catalog of apps and also features movies, TV, music and even devices but device availability is region-dependent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the store brings you highlighted apps based on recommendations and your usage. Different categories and app rankings will make app discovery easier.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Blade S6 is definitely an eye-catcher but the iPhone looks may be doing it more harm than favors at some markets. Apple is a natural target for replicas - there are blatant copycats and then there are phones like the Blade S6, which manage to retain an identity if their own. Still, brands like ZTE and Lenovo don't have to go there to get noticed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exterior may be inspired by Apple, but using the phone is a genuine Android experience and that appears to be ZTE's intention. With bright blue buttons and a slick and colorful Android Lollipop interface, ZTE has created a reasonably-priced phone that looks good and also breezes through every-day tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing really too fancy about the device, but that is definitely not a bad thing, as a true assistant really needs to blend in rather than stand out and the Blade S6 fits the bill perfectly. Well, if you don't mind it declaring it was "designed in California".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not to say that the phone is free of fault. Despite being based on upper-midrange hardware it seems to be outperformed by a couple of equally equipped rivals. ZTE might have skipped on some optimization and development time and we can't help but feel the phone could have performed even better with a few tweaks here and there. A few applications also need a total overhaul, especially the camera to make for a more unified and fluent user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, the ZTE Blade S6 has a lot of potential and offers an impressive package for a price tag of $250, but it leaves the impression that there is still a lot to be refined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The midrange market is becoming extremely competitive with major players doing all they can to offer as much screen estate, resolution and processing power in a budget-friendly package. The ZTE Blade S6 does have one of the attractive spec sheets in its price bracket. Android 5.0 Lollipop is the definite highlight and it comes with reasonable performance and solid imaging and connectivity credentials. But as we already said, it doesn't always live up to them. Let's check out some of the closest rivals in term of hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 820 is powered by the same Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 SoC only with a lower clock speed on four of its A53 cores, 1.5GHz as opposed to the Blade's 1.7GHz. GPU and RAM are the same. Yet the Desire managed to outperform the Blade S6 in a lot of our tests. The screen couldn't be the culprit, as the HTC also has a 720p HD screen, just a little bit bigger at 5.5-inches. Maybe the Blade S6's chipset and Android 5.0 are just not a perfect match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is important that the Desire 820 is a good $100 more expensive than the ZTE. For the extra cash you get a better front-facing camera at 8MP as well as a pair of front-facing speakers. Another important note is that LTE coverage is way better on the HTC. The Blade can potentially be having trouble with certain US networks, while the Desire 820 should be perfectly OK on any LTE network in the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire 820</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another notable device with the same basic hardware is the super-slim Oppo R5. We are way out of the price bracket with this one, but it is powered by the same Qualcomm silicon. It offers a much more premium experience, including build quality and finish as well as an improved Full HD AMOLED display. It is by no means an economical choice and you can probably find better hardware at its price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo has and equally spec'd device coming out soon as well, but again it should be in an entirely different league, pricewise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Oppo R5 &#x2022; Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's take a look at what else there is in ZTE's price range. First up is the Motorola Moto G (2014). It costs about as much as the Blade S6 (can even be found for as little as $200), with a dual-SIM version, available as well. Despite its humble appearance and less impressive spec sheet (based around an S400 chipset), the small Moto packs quite a punch (save for the camera) and is a solid performer. The Moto G also offers a stock Android experience, second only to that offered by the Nexus devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto G (2014)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new contender in the budget price bracket is the Acer Liquid Jade S. It costs roughly the same as the Blade S6, perhaps even $10 to $15 less and offers a Mediatek MT6572M SoC with eight Cortex A53 cores, clocked at 1.5 GHz. This might be a little slower that the Snapdragon 615 in multi-core performance, but single-core all but balances things out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Liquid Jade S is equipped with a Mali-T760MP2 GPU, which is arguably a little better than the Adreno 405. Other specs are mostly the same: 2GB of RAM, a 13MP main and a 5MP front-facing camera and both are LTE-enabled Dual-SIM handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer Liquid Jade S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 is Sony's first attempt at a selfie-centered phone. Its hardware is very similar to Moto G's (2014), but it comes with a slightly bigger 5.5-inch 720p display. This, coupled with a spectacular endurance rating of 91 hours, makes the C3 a formidable rival to the ZTE Blade S6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia C3 Dual</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo S90 Sisley is a natural pick here, powered by a less powerful but equally new Snapdragon 410 chipset. The second-biggest difference is a higher-res selfie cam on the Sisley. The rest is pretty much on par - an LTE-enabled Dual-SIM 720p five-incher. iPhone 6 clones, both of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Lenovo S90 Sisley</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going by specs alone, the ZTE Bade S6 is more than a solid choice in the price range. The Dual-SIM support combined with LTE and Lollipop do work in its favor and ZTE seems to think there can't be right and wrong reasons to get the Blade S6. They are certainly aware that brand recognition isn't their strongest asset and they tried to do something about it. They just could've done better than simply copying Apple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't mind that, the ZTE Blade S6 has the potential to make it quite far given proper backing from your carrier. So keep an eye out for it.</paragraph>
