			<paragraph>This sure looks like a pair of ducks but a good player can play it as an ace. And it's got nothing to do with luck. You cannot always hold the best cards but you can try and make the best of the cards you're dealt. And they may as well be SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the popularity and practicality of dual-SIM devices can vary, there are certain markets where single-carrier coverage is incomplete, making the use of two SIM cards almost a necessity. Not to mention the money that can be saved by combining different plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ever-popular Galaxy line from Samsung is one of the most versatile ever, offering devices which range across all sorts of specs and sizes. It offers more and more dual-SIM handsets too, keeping with the Samsung strategy to cover every segment of the market. In the past few years the Koreans have cooked up a dual-SIM solution for almost every taste but it's dual-SIM smartphones that have shown big potential for growth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are now looking at the dual-SIM version of the Galaxy Ace, while the entry level Galaxy Y line has two of those already. Even the premium Galaxy S series will soon enlist a dual-SIM, so Samsung must be serious about two-in-one smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos builds on the Galaxy Y Duos but tries to keep within budget. Here it is at a glance:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A look at the spec sheet tells us that the Ace Duos is marketed towards a budget-minded crowd. It looks to convert yet more of those die-hard featurephone enthusiasts into the smartphone game, with a device that provides the functionality they're used to (in this case, two SIM cards simultaneously), without the monetary burden of a premium device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's take a look at how this lower-midrange dual-SIM smartphone from Samsung handles. The unboxing and hardware inspection start on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package: as basic as it gets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package revealed nothing extraordinary in terms of accessories to the Galaxy Ace Duos. While you'll find the standard A/C adapter and USB cable combo, there are no other extras to further entice buyers - not even headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ace Duos comes with 3GB of internal storage, which is enough to start with, but the omission of a microSD card is still not good news. If you have a large music library you might need to get one separately .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do appreciate the charger being a single piece, instead of having to use it with the data cable, but still the feeling remains that Samsung could have done a little more to sweeten the retail pot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos S6802 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos comes in at 112.7 x 61.5 x 11.5 mm. With a weight of 122 g, the device feels solid in-hand, and compact enough to fit comfortably in-hand or in-pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ever since the Wave Y, ruggedly-textured, beveled back panels have been a common sight on most of Samsung's basic smartphones, instead of slick, glossy surfaces which are a fingerprint nightmare and not too secure to hold. The Ace Duos' back panel is nice to the touch, and makes holding the phone a pleasant experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our main grudge is the front panel, where things are a bit boring. We've seen Samsung use the same design over and over and we really wished we were treated to something fresh here. That being said, the Ace Duos is targeted at newcomers to the smartphone game, who are unlikely to be bored with the design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Ace Duos is a design mix of the two generations of the Galaxy Ace. Up front, it's almost impossible to tell apart from the original Ace, while the back has the fine texture and the subtle chin of the Ace 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos S6802 is mostly composed of the 3.5 inch display. Below it we find the usual three-button combo. There's the traditional Home key in the middle, with capacitive Menu and Back buttons on either side. All three controls have the usual functionality on a long press we've become used to in Gingerbread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking above the display, we're not greeted by the usual sensors found on most smartphones. An ambient light sensor is missing, so you'll have to adjust the brightness of your screen manually, and there's no front-facing camera either. In fact, there isn't even a proximity sensor. The screen locks instead a couple of seconds into a call and unlocks upon a double tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The edges of the Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos S6802 are notably absent of the usual array of slots and buttons we're used to from Samsung. This is not necessarily a bad thing, particularly for fans of more minimalist designs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side hosts only the volume rocker, as well as a small lanyard eyelet. At the other end we have only the power key. A dedicated camera key would've been nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy Ace Duos is where the 3.5mm audio jack is located, while the microUSB port can be found at the bottom, alongside the microphone. Both the audio jack and the microUSB port are unprotected. There's also a small slot on the top for opening the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the Galaxy Ace Duos over we find the 5 megapixel auto-focus camera and the loudspeaker grille. There's a distinct lack of an LED flash, which could make low-light shooting with the Ace Duos problematic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the back panel is done easily with the nail tab located on the top, and reveals the 1300 mAh Li-Ion battery that powers the Ace Duos. The panel must be removed to access the microSD card slot, while the two SIM card slots are located underneath the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We concluded our battery tests and the Galaxy Ace Duos S6802 showed average performance. We squeezed out all of the official 7 hours of talk time on a 3G network, almost to the minute. You should consider switching to 2G if that seems like not enough time. You can read more about the Ace Duos battery life in our blog. More info on our testing routine can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned the Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos S6802 comes with a 3.5" LCD of HVGA resolution. It has a pixel density of about 165 ppi, which puts it squarely in the average range for devices in its class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Half a year ago this would have been a very good screen for the price range, but by today's standards the resolution is unimpressive and while the poor viewing angles and sunlight legibility are to be expected, we can only go as far as to say that the display gets the job done - no more, no less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's how the Galaxy Ace Duos screen fared in our traditional display tests. You can learn more about the testing procedures here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We zoomed into the display using our digital microscope so you can get a better idea of how the pixels are arranged, and how big they are. As you can see, the pixel size is similar to that found on the Samsung Galaxy mini 2, which suggests a display inferior to what than is typical for the Ace family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Galaxy Ace Duos display pixels compared to those of the Galaxy mini 2</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The general handling of the Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos S6802 is pretty good, due in large part to the pleasantly textured back panel and compact, minimalist design. It is a bit of a hassle to have to remove the back panel to get access to the SIM and microSD card slot, but having fewer buttons along the side makes it a bit more pleasing from an aesthetic standpoint - although ultimately it boils down to personal preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next, we take a look at the Android Gingerbread interface powering the Samsung Ace Duos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gingerbread with TouchWiz topping<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace Duos S6802 runs on the rather outdated Android Gingerbread 2.3.6 and has Samsung's custom TouchWiz launcher. The Broadcom processor is clocked at 832 MHz, and there's 512 MB of RAM onboard. While this is a common range among most Samsung droids in the lower end of the spectrum, Samsung usually opt for a CPU of the Scorpion variety. And with ample reason - the Broadcom BCM21553 has a noticeably difficult time keeping up with what you're trying to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps this is due to the extra manufacturing costs imposed by the additional SIM card, but it seems that Samsung have opted for a cheaper processor to keep the price low, and this has cost them in terms of performance. You can see for yourself in our brief video of the device in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen of the Ace Duos has the usual integration of missed events with shortcuts to the relevant apps. Missed calls and incoming texts are displayed but not emails. The lockscreen can be removed by swiping in any direction. Pressing the power/lock button brings up the lockscreen in about 2-3 seconds, taking so long as to make you unsure of whether or not you've pressed it, which can get aggravating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen accommodates tons of widgets with lots of functionality. You can have up to 7 homescreen panes, each identified by numbered dots which appear when side-scrolling. A pinch on the homescreen zooms out to an aggregate view of all active panes, which can then be rearranged, deleted or added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets, shortcuts or folders are added by a press and hold on an empty spot on the homescreen, or by hitting on the contextual menu key and selecting the Add option. Here, you can select which of the above categories to add via onscreen menus. No widget previews are given, and you cannot resize widgets either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher lets you rearrange apps however you like, but you cannot filter by downloaded apps or favorites, and there's no list view. You cannot create additional folders or pages either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the screen that are visible from both the homescreen and the app launcher. From left to right they are Phone, Contacts, Messaging and Applications. A press and hold lets you drag any of them to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher on the Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos is launched by a long press of the Home key. It has a shortcut to a custom task manager, which not only lets you kill apps one-by-one and in bulk, but offers plenty of stats on installations, RAM usage and storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Task Manager comes with a handy Program Monitor widget, which shows you the number of active applications right on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the time, Android does really well when it comes to managing apps by itself (in fact, some claim that using a task manager is detrimental to the performance of a phone), so you should only need the task manager to occasionally kill a buggy app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos runs on a single-core 832 MHz Broadcom BCM21553 processor with integrated GPU and has 512 MB worth of RAM. The device itself performs most touch-based tasks with a delay of about a second, which can be annoying, particularly if you're used to a faster smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack tests pure processing speed and, as expected, the Ace Duos struggled to match, let alone outperform devices in its class. The two devices it did beat, the Galaxy Y Duos and Galaxy Ace, both came out in 2011.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a class where poor 3D performance is almost a given, the Galaxy Ace Duos hits rock bottom. NenaMark 2 tests the GPU speed, and 11 frames per second means that apps and games with intensive 3D graphics are going run terribly on the Ace Duos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In SunSpider and BrowserMark, our two browser tests, the Ace Duos again managed a poor score. Browsing is noticeably laggy while webpages are loading, and Flash content is a no-go, due to the outdated ARMv6 CPU.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance of the Ace Duos leaves much to be desired, and we attribute much of this to the Broadcom BCM21553 processor. The Galaxy Pocket and Galaxy Y Duos also share the BCM21553, and their poor showing backs up our theory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has a wide range of features and practically unlimited storage capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you've created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has the Quick contacts feature, which lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The TouchWiz-specific swiping gesture is here too - swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right to add another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign in to your Facebook or LinkedIn account. After syncing, the phonebook will automatically merge your contacts (you can do it manually too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact info screen is tabbed. The first two tabs are pretty standard - one displays the person's contact information, while the other stores call and message history. The third and fourth tabs handle the social stuff - status updates and the contact's online galleries.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM calling and dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S6802 Ace Duos has a dedicated SIM Manager to configure how calls and data are handled on both cards. SIM cards on the Ace Duos are not hot-swappable, both slots located underneath the battery, so you have to turn the device off in order to add or remove them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whenever you add a new SIM card and power the device on, an interface pops up allowing you to rename and even change the icon of any SIM card to more easily identify them. This interface can be accessed at any time from the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ace Duos remembers the settings for any SIM you customize, which is great if you've got more than two SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ace Duos allows for both SIM cards to be active simultaneously, meaning that you can receive a call on one SIM even while you are on a call with the other. What happens is that calls from your other SIM are forwarded to your currently active SIM's network, which you can put on hold to answer (this might incur additional network charges). You can put the two calls on and off hold as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can toggle the Dual SIM Always On option on or off for either SIM card. Effectively, this enables call waiting and call forwarding so you can switch each SIM card on and off individually (which can help save battery).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pick which SIM is to be used for mobile data - only one can be used at a time. Another option is whether or not the phone should be able to receive calls on the other SIM while using mobile data on one SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is involved in SIM management too. Underneath the quick system toggles, there are big buttons labeled SIM 1 and SIM 2, for quick switching between cards before dialing a number. During a call, the active SIM gets displayed at the top of the call interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos had no issues with reception even in areas with poor coverage. Sound in the earpiece was crisp and fairly loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and whenever you tap a digit and both contact numbers and names containing it are displayed. The catch is that name searching works with only the initial letter. On the other hand, number searching looks up recent calls too. If more than one contact is found, a button with a number and an arrow will display the rest of the matches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no proximity sensor on the Ace Duos, the screen locks itself a couple of seconds into a call and unlocks upon a double tap so you can access the onscreen options. The available options during a call include using the keypad, muting the call, or adding another call to the conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list. A tiny icon identifies the SIM that made or received the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos has one of the quietest loudspeakers we've tested, scoring Below Average in our traditional loudspeaker test. Here's how it stacks up against the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging interface is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly locate a message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers a combined inbox option, which color-codes emails from different accounts for easier sorting and viewing. Conversation layout is also available - it groups related emails into single entries with a number in parenthesis showing the number of emails grouped. A tap on that entry expands it to show a list of the individual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text entry goes, you have the standard Samsung keyboard at your disposal, as well as XT9. Both are fairly comfortable, although the keys might feel a little cramped in portrait. The landscape keyboard should be good enough. There's handwriting recognition and Swype support as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Slick gallery and file browser, but no real image editing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos S8602 uses a slightly dumbed-down version of the standard Android gallery, as it does not include an edit feature. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It can even import the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you. It displays full resolution images and supports double tap and pinch zoom. Sharing images over Bluetooth, email and MMS are enabled, and so is uploading to Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but efficient file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My Files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung have enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, tracks are sorted into four categories - All, Playlists, Albums and Artists. From the settings, you can add or remove categories to set up the music player just the way you like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art has a central place in the Now Playing interface, but you can replace it with an equalizer. You can skip songs by sideways swipes, and there's an onscreen scrubber and volume slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice feature allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 4 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset still needs to be plugged in to act as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Abysmal video codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playback is another area where the Broadcom processor lets us down. The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos does not come with a dedicated video player application. Instead, to play video files, you have to browse them either from the My Files app or the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player can handle pretty much only MP4 files, and not all types, either. There's no DivX/XviD support and HD video is, of course, out of the question. Sadly though, so are WVGA videos so you might need to do quite a lot of converting on your computer if you are to watch videos on your Ace Duos .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player seemed to only work with AAC audio and refused to play files containing audio in other formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface itself is as simple and as it could possibly be - there almost isn't one. The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons as well as a scrollable progress bar. Oddly enough, there's a video trimmer that is surprisingly functional. We only wish Samsung had added some codec support to go along with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos S6802 did really well in our audio quality test. The smartphone was nearly perfect with an active external amplifier and quite good when a pair of headphones was plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An active external amplifier lets the Galaxy Ace Duos show its full potential and achieve some excellent scores. It's only averagely loud, but that's just the only bad thing we can say about it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The degradation when headphones come into play consists of a minor hike in stereo crosstalk, and some extra intermodulation distortion. We'd call this a solid performance on far more expensive smartphones, but here it's even more imrpessive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos comes with a 5MP camera and is able to capture photos at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. The lack of an actual shutter key is a clear sign that photography isn't taken too seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface looks familiar with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the scene and shooting mode buttons, as well as the exposure slider and the settings button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sample photos we took are well above average in quality. Images have impressively low noise levels, and while the dynamic range wasn't great, colors come out good (if a little faded) and there's plenty of detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In certain situations where there was movement at medium range the image would get skewed slightly, but for the most part that was a rare occurrence.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos can be measured against other 5MP cameraphones in our Photo Compare Tool. The tool's page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording is better than nothing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera. You get the same customizable panel on the left with four shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to Samsung, the Galaxy Ace Duos can shoot 640 x 480 video at 30fps in MP4 format. Our camera samples revealed that it hovers around 25fps. Either way, VGA quality is far from impressive these days, with more and more devices able to do 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are smooth but the level of detail isn't impressive. Colors are okay and so is the focus in the video. The Ace Duos records mono sound with a bitrate of 96Kbps, and we found it to be a little quiet. Check out the sample we uploaded to YouTube:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched VGA@25fps sample (5.7MB) taken straight from the phone.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid web browser, questionable speed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, and find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browser performance on the Ace Duos is not a very smooth ride. There's significant slowdown when loading pages, meaning that you have to wait until the entire page loads before you can effectively browse it. Flash content does not work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SNS integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Social hub we've seen before - it combines your email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) and shows all incoming messages in one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There's filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ace Duos also comes with the Google+ and Messenger preloaded, which can take care of all your Google+ needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard organizational tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S6802 Galaxy Ace Duos comes with Quickoffice - a document viewer that can handle Word and Excel files, as well as PDFs and PowerPoint. Unfortunately, the version preinstalled is not the Pro version and document editing is disabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: list, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view (often referred to as Agenda view) shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It's a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. Turning the phone landscape reveals more advanced calculator functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos' Clock application can turn your device into a desk clock, from where you can set various alarms, each with their own start and repeat time. There is also a quick shortcut to the music player, as well as a slide show option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app is pretty self-explanatory - it lets you create text memos, complete with SNS integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a Voice recorder to round off the organizer functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos managed to get a GPS lock in just under a minute without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always-cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store and Samsung Apps market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Duos has the latest version of the Google Play app store. The new name and icon aside there aren't major changes to the look and feel. In select countries, aside from apps you'll also find music, movies and books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Apps works in much the same way; there's a featured interface which shows the more popular app highlights, as well as pages which display the newest and most downloaded applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the option to browse through app categories, and installing an app is done in exactly the same way as in the Play Store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Dual-SIM solutions have always been popular - especially in markets with incomplete carrier coverage, where they're almost mandatory. They will be in even greater demand it seems, as emerging markets are ready to embrace affordable smartphones. Samsung are one of the few big name companies that cater to crowds looking for a budget dual-SIM solution with a proper smartphone platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while the Galaxy S6802 Ace Duos bears the Ace name, the dual-SIM capabilities mean a more fitting comparison will be that to the Galaxy Y Duos, rather than the original Galaxy Ace which was released over a year and a half ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ace Duos has nonetheless very similar specs to the original Ace, but the less capable chipset takes a heavy toll on performance. With the Galaxy Y, Samsung compensated for the low speed by reducing the display resolution and screen size. With the Ace Duos, Samsung have again upped the resolution to HVGA, but the Broadcom BCM2155 processor from the Galaxy Y family clearly struggles to keep up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While HVGA certainly looks better than the display of the Galaxy Y Duos, the sub-par performance is what it took to achieve it. Despite increasing the amount of RAM over the original Samsung Galaxy Ace, the Ace Duos actually performs worse in some of our benchmarks. And we're talking about a phone released in February of 2011 and even then only considered mid-range!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Which brings us to price. Currently, the Samsung Ace Duos retails around &#x20ac;180, while the Y Duos can be had for about &#x20ac;120. But are the somewhat higher specs worth paying an extra &#x20ac;60? Perhaps the most notable difference, besides screen quality, is the camera. The 5MP shooter on the Ace Duos handily beats out the 3MP one found on the Y Duos, and we won't even go into how terrible the QVGA video quality on the Y Duos is. One other important difference between the two is the more elaborate dual SIM management on the Ace Duos.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>LG has just released a budget dual-SIM solution of its own, which looks to rival the ones from Samsung. The dual-SIM variant of the Optimus L3 has a smaller screen of QVGA resolution, less storage and RAM, and a smaller 3MP camera. It's powered by the Qualcomm MSM7225A and will most likely be priced lower as well, perhaps around the &#x20ac;120 mark to compete with the Y Duos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus L3 E405</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also more advanced dual-SIM solutions in the works from Samsung, such as the Galaxy S Duos. It boasts a 4" WVGA screen alongside a full range of sensors and a front-facing VGA camera. It runs on a 1 GHz Qualcomm processor, and will even feature Android ICS. Unfortunately, with this kind of specs, the former flagship variant will most likely find itself in a higher price bracket than the Ace Duos.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>So, should you get a Samsung S6802 Galaxy Ace Duos? If you're looking for a device that offers dual-SIM capabilities and Android alongside a good camera, there aren't that many options. The thing to consider is worse performance in benchmarks than its predecessor from over a year ago. On the plus side, the Ace Duos offers an advanced dual-SM solution, complete with fast data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Duos isn't the fastest device around but it's targeting users with no basis for comparison. Anyone coming from a featurephone will be happy to keep discovering what their new smartphone can do for them. And it will already be time for you to upgrade by the time you discover that things can get done a lot faster, too.</paragraph>
