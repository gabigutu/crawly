			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The freshly announced Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is the first tablet from Samsung to sport the highly-revered S moniker. Ultra-slim and sexy, the device has the internals too to merit the special letter. The eponymous bunch of handsets propelled Samsung to the top of the smartphone high-end, so seeing the S letter on the back of a tablet carries a great deal of expectation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you haven't noticed, Samsung is on a mission to take over the tablet marketplace this year - starting as early as January, the Korean giant has been churning out tablets at blistering pace. However, the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is not just another market entry by the manufacturer. Thanks to its gorgeous 8.4" Super AMOLED display with 2560 x 1600 pixels, sleek body, and powerful hardware, the newcomer has its eyes set on taking the compact tablet crown from the iPad mini 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest highlight of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is undoubtedly its display. The high-resolution Super AMOLED unit is simply a joy to look at and a perfect place to gobbling up any content. Having plenty of the latter come for free out of the box is not too shabby either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is more to the slate than its display though. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is thinner and lighter than the iPad mini 2 without skimping on hardware or functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The split-screen multitasking on the other hand, ensures that the slate is not simply a toy for leisure, but a serious productivity tool as well. It also gives the Tab S 8.4 an edge over its Cupertino rival in this regard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is an unboxing, followed by design and build quality inspection. Read on to find out how that Super AMOLED display looks and feels like in the flesh.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 ships in a box with the same design as its smartphone relatives. Inside it you will find the tablet, a charger and a microUSB cable, as well as some booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the stature of the tablet in Samsung's product range, a pair of bundled headphones would have been highly appreciated. Unfortunately, the Tab S 8.4 does not follow the example set by its smartphone siblings in this regard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Additional accessories<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like most of its Galaxy smartphones and phablets, Samsung will be offering flip covers for the Galaxy Tab S series. The original cover for the Tab S 8.4, once attached, leaves almost the entire back exposed but would protect the entire front. It doubles as a stand too. Another version of the cover folds around the entire slate and doubles as a kickstand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 unsurprisingly features the same design as the rest of the company's tablet lineup, save for the rear finish. The latter features the same faux perforated leather-like look as the Samsung Galaxy S5, thus bringing yet another reason to justify the presence of the letter S in the tablet's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A rather controversial part of the tablet's design has to do with the available Dazzling White and Titanium Bronze color schemes. The former features a back cover with pearl effect with gold bezel, while Titanium Bronze in real life sports a back cover in grey/brown which changes its hue under different light with, once again, gold bezel. The two colors look a tad gaudy in person - plain black with the usual chrome bezel would have been the safer, better choice it seems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is up to the company's usually high standards. The slate is superbly put together and is certain to handle heavy use without hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The physical measures of Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 are 212.8 x 125.6 x 6.6mm, for a weight of 294 grams. The newcomer is notably lighter and thinner than the already slender Apple iPad mini 2 (331 grams and 7.5 mm respectively).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is a pleasure. The perforated faux leather back, despite being ridiculed by the competition, is extremely grippy. It allows users to handle the ultra-slim device without worrying much about accidental drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The light weight of the tablet allows it to be held with one hand without causing any unnecessary strain.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 features a gorgeous 8.4" WQXGA display with a resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels. Its pixel density of 359ppi handily beats that of the iPad mini 2's 324ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung took three years before fitting another Super AMOLED display in a tablet, but we are happy to tell you that the wait was well worth it. The screen of the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is the best we've seen in a tablet by quite a margin. It is beautiful to look at with its deep blacks and saturated (if you choose that) colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the numbers. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 has a practically unlimited contrast ratio, as individual pixels don't get lit up - AMOLEDs light up only the parts of the screen that display a different color beside black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 diamond-pattern PenTile matrix vs Samsung Galaxy S5 diamond-pattern PenTile matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED panel on the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 isn't the brightest we've seen, it's actually inferior to the Galaxy Tab Pro slates, the Xperia Z2 Tablet and the latest iPads. However in most cases you won't notice this in practice unless you put the Tab S side by side with an iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The outdoor visibility is great, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is still providing several screen color modes to match the particular needs of different user groups. They include Adaptive display, AMOLED cinema, AMOLED photo, and Basic mode. No matter which mode you choose, it's really hard to describe how impressive the 8.4" screen actually is before you see it in real life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a video comparing the newcomer's screen with the iPad Mini with Retina display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Super AMOLED display alone makes the tablet one of the best compact offerings on the market. It really is that good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will find the ambient light sensor, as well as the front-facing camera. A Samsung logo keeps them company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen (portrait) is where the usual trio of Samsung buttons for Android navigation are. The fingerprint sensor it there too - its implementation is the same as in the Samsung Galaxy S5. You can use it for unlocking the slate, authorizing PayPal transactions and even protecting individual images and messages on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing on the left side of the tablet. The right side is home to the power/lock key and volume rocker, the IR port, as well as the microSD card slot. The SIM card slot of the LTE version is also located there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port are located on the bottom of the device. One of the stereo speakers is there too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other stereo speaker and a microphone are located on top of the device. That's the proper placement for landscape mode, which is how you're going to watch videos. The minor niggle is the speakers are facing sideways, not front as on the second Galaxy Tab generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The perforated faux leather back of the tablet is home to the 8MP main camera and its single LED flash. Two prominent circles on the right side is where the proprietary flip covers are attached. A Samsung logo completes the picture.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung rates the 4,900mAh battery of the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 to be capable of providing up to ten hours of web usage. The Ultra Power Saving Mode which debuted on the Samsung Galaxy S5 is present too - it can extend the quoted life even further, although we are not sure it makes as much sense on a tablet which is rarely away from a charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we tested the battery performance of the tablet during web browsing and video playback. It performed admirably on both occasions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ultra power saving mode which made a debut on the Samsung Galaxy S5 is on board too. It drastically prolongs the tablet?s battery life by allowing only a handful essential apps to function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feature also utilizes the energy efficiency of the Super AMOLED display via a black background. As you probably know, AMOLED displays turn off their individual pixels while showing black color.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 comes in two flavors - Wi-Fi only and LTE. The LTE model features quad-band GSM and 3G support with HSPDA up to 42Mbps. The LTE support covers six bands and is category 4, which means you get up to 150Mbps downlink and up to 50Mbps uplink speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both tablet versions feature Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac support, with 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA support are also available as well as GPS and GLONASS receivers. Bluetooth 4.0 is also available for local data transfer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 also supports USB-on-the-go, but you will need to buy an additional adapter for that. The tablet can work with USB storage, USB mice and keyboards. Of course, you can always hook up a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard to the slate without relying on the cable connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also buy a MHL HDMI adapter and use it to pair with HDTV via a regular HDMI cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An IR blaster on the right of the tablet allows it to remotely control TV's and other devices using the Samsung WatchON app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last piece of the connectivity puzzle, NFC, is missing though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SideSync 3.0 allows you to pair your tablet with your Galaxy S5 smartphone. The latter shows up virtually on the tablet's display; you can control its functions, make calls, and answer messages while it is in your bag or pocket. It really works very well and can come in handy if you use your tablet at home, while the phone is charging somewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Remote PC client is also preinstalled on the device. It seriously boosts its productivity credentials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung AllShare feature is integrated with the Samsung's default apps - the Video Player app, the Gallery, and the Music Player - and it allows you wirelessly stream all sorts of multimedia content to your connected stereo or HDTV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Link (previously known as AllShare Play) is another proprietary service offered by Samsung. Once you download the dedicated app, it automatically syncs all the multimedia content on your device to Samsung servers so it's backed up and also available for instant play on your other Samsung devices, including your Samsung SmartTV.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 runs on the latest available Android 4.4.2 KitKat version, but Samsung's customizations run so deep, you'll barely recognize Google's platform underneath it. The slate doesn't come only with TouchWiz UI, but also with Magazine UI for its homescreens. The latter is a fully functional replacement for you homescreen that does way more than just feed you news and social updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video of the tablet in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab S 8.4 features the same homescreen layout as the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4, but with flat-looking icons a la Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slate has a familiar lockscreen that supports multiple widgets. There is also the app drawer that can stack your apps in folders or even hide apps that you don't use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two type of homescreens - Magazine and TouchWiz. Having at least one Magazine pane is obligatory, while the TouchWiz panes are optional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Magazine pane would hold up to six widgets, but those widgets always occupy the whole screen - there is no background or docked shortcuts as you are used to seeing on all other Androids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Magazine's widgets use flat interface and can be easily resized. They also resize automatically in portrait and landscape orientation of the slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Magazine widgets are a mixture between various content aggregators, powerful mini versions of system apps, and nicely designed shortcuts. The content aggregators support news from a lot of categories (business, design, movies, food, music, sports, politics, travel, tech, etc.) and social services (500px, Facebook, Twitter). You can choose the specific topics for each Magazine widget. The widgets are flappable just like the Flipboard UI and you don't need to leave your Magazine homescreen pane to check out several stories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aggregators aside, the rest of the widgets give you quick access to the most used apps - gallery, office, hubs, calendar, weather, and multimedia players. Finally, you have two different widgets that hold your favorite and frequently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have standard homescreens as well. You can add app shortcuts there plus the standard Android widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling between the content-laden homescreens is still quick - first, you go through the Magazine panes and then through the TouchWiz ones. It's a looped scrolling process, so once you reach the last homescreen you'll go back to the first. You can choose whichever homescreen you prefer to be the tablet's default one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has Volume scrubber and Volume shortcut next to the brightness slider. All icons have been refreshed, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switching interface utilizes the high resolution and doesn't occupy the whole screen. The powerful task manager is also onboard and allows you to kill apps, clean RAM, or uninstall downloaded apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi Window multi-tasking is here as well. To access this feature you must enable it from settings. Then you can open its menu from anywhere in the UI by a left swipe from the right edge of the screen where you would find all the apps supported by the Multi Window UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can minimize such an app to just a floating icon, go full screen or just close it. You can open as many floating apps as you like, though you can have only a single app instance running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Multi Window supports combinations - you can assign a shortcut that opens any two apps of your choice side-by-side with just one tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Finger Scanner which first appeared in the Samsung Galaxy S5 is on board too. Its functionality hasn?t changed ? it can only be utilized for unlocking the device, making PayPal payments, and logging into your Samsung account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is only a matter of time before Samsung unlocks the full potential of the fingerprint scanner by allowing developers to utilize it in their apps. We hope that we won?t have to wait long before this happens.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benhcmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi-only version of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 features Exynos Octa 5422 chipset with 1.9GHz quad-core Cortex-A15 CPU and 1.3 GHz quad-core Cortex-A7 CPU. The GPU is Mali-T628 GPU, while 3GB of RAM make sure everything runs smoothly on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 and AnTuTu 4 are benchmarks which put to the test the hardware combo inside the tablet. GeekBench 3 is more CPU-intensive, whereas AnTuTu 4 is a compound benchmark - testing CPU, GPU, memory performance among others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single-core, multi-core, and math performance. The tablet didn't blow us away on this occasion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up we have GFXBench's 2.7 T-Rex and 3.0 Manhattan. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 performed in an underwhelming fashion here - its GPU simply couldn't manage all the pixels the way a flagship device should during the on-screen tests. The off-screen results were slightly better, yet still far from the top of the charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark 2.1 looks at HTML 5 performance, while Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 is JavaScript-centric. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 set both benchmarks on fire - it posted the best results we've seen to date on both occasions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Overall, the processing performance of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is quite good although its GPU could have been better, especially considering the high pressure that the high-res screen puts on it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab S 8.4 comes in Wi-Fi-only and LTE flavors. The latter is capable of voice telephony and will come with a pre-installed Phone app. The Wi-Fi model that we got for reviewing only has the Contacts app, which serves the other methods of communicating - IM and email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the Contacts app syncs automatically with Google and your social networks, while you can choose which contacts to display. You can do everything a phone book should be capable of - edit a contact, import/export, join contacts, send or print name cards, get friends via social services, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two email clients we are used to see on Samsung devices are onboard - the Gmail app provided by Google and the Email client courtesy of Samsung. Both have a split-screen interface, support multiple accounts, bulk actions and folder view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Samsung Email app supports POP3, IMAP and Microsoft Exchange. It also offers a useful Magazine widget, which will probably see lots of use if you are into email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Hangouts is the default IM client out of the box. Naturally, you can install Samsung ChatON as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung QWERTY keyboard occupies about half of the screen in landscape and about a third of screen in portrait view. There are two additional keyboard layouts to try out. You can opt for the small floating keyboard and a split keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, the manufacturer has added a Del button which sits right on top of the usual backspace. The newcomer is quite useful while editing text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Choosing the split keyboard allows you to quickly thumb-type while holding the tablet with both hands. It also leaves much more room for text, especially in the email client where the compose interface is in a popup that fits right between the two halves of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several other options are available to make text input easier, including various options for predictive text and auto correction. Swipe input is also supported or if you disable it, you can swipe left and right across the keyboard to move the cursor. The large keyboard does have arrow keys though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>My Files app organizes your files into categories - Images, Videos, Music, Documents, downloaded apps, recent files and even Dropbox files. Those categories are always visible on the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split between folders and their content (with a complete tree view, similar to Windows Explorer).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager app is easily accessible at all times - there is a shortcut located at the bottom left of all homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>My Files app can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. It will browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive). More advanced functions include handling ZIP files and connecting to FTP servers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 offers various sorting and viewing options. Pinch zooming in or out will increase or reduce the size of the thumbnails. The album view shows a stack of photos with a navigational bar on the left with all the albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app supports bulk actions and photo notes. There are lots of sharing options as well, as well as a powerful embedded image editor. It supports highly customizable slideshows, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player relies on a customizable tabbed interface rather than the previous split-screen UI. Playlists are supported as well. The bottom of the screen has the basic music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options - a timeline scrubber for the track, playback controls, and an AllShare shortcut. A coverflow-like list of album art lets you know what the next song will be and is an easy way to skip to it. The music player will also try to find the lyrics for the song you're listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has implemented several audio-enhancement features. The equalizer presets (called SoundAlive) are cleverly organized into a square similar to the Music Square. The presets balance between Treble and Bass, Vocals and Instrumental. You can also just tap the Auto toggle or enable a Tube amp effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has three tabs - Personal, Downloads and Nearby devices - complete with a search field. The available videos show up as a grid of animated thumbnails, but list and folder view are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the video codec support is quite subpar. Most videos we tried resulted in an "audio codec not supported" message and even some basic video codecs don't work (i.e. DivX). MKV, AVI (XviD) and MP4 videos do play, but anything beyond MP3 or AAC sound is no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting feature of the video player is the ability to have a video running in a pop-up, which is visible throughout the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology from the music player is available here too. There are additional settings for the brightness, playback speed and feeding the audio through Bluetooth (if you have wireless speakers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If subtitles are available, the video player will automatically find and load them. You can also manually load subtitles, if the video and subtitle file names don't match. You can change the zoom mode (100% or fit to screen with and without affecting the videos aspect ratio) and there's a pinch zoom too, in case you want to get close to a specific part of the action.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 performance in our audio quality test is very much in line with the recent high-end tablets and smartphones by the company. When docked to an active external amplifier, it produced stellar audio, scoring greatly in every part of the test. Its volume levels were above average too, rounding up an excellent overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo crosstalk degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones is rather big, but the good news is none of the other readings are affected. It?s not a perfect performance here, but one that should please the vast majority of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While our Galaxy Tab S 8.4 doesn't have telephony features, we still tested the stereo speakers performance as the slate will be used for music and videos. It scored a Good score and we can confirm the stereo speakers are indeed loud enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on the testing procedure here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 features 8MP f/2.4 main camera, capable of capturing still images with a resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels in 4:3 aspect ratio. Users who opt for 16:9 images will have to make do with a resolution of 3264 x 1836 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is similar to that of the Samsung Galaxy S5. There's a column of shortcuts on the left, the middle two of which are customizable (you can add up to three shortcuts). All settings are collected into a grid of shortcuts so you can access everything easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mode button is a scrollable list at the bottom. Several options have been combined into Shot &amp; more - Best photo, Best face, Drama shot, Eraser and Panning shot. You can download additional modes too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 camera produces the same high-quality photos as unit found in the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4. The amount of detail is high, the noise is low and the photos have good color rendering. There are some issues, like the noticeable oversharpening halos, but those are minor overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The snapper's HDR mode does an excellent job of adding more detail in the highlights and keeping the real-life look of the photos without going overboard with the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a quick look at the performance of the single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also took some time to snap some samples from our traditional shooting scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an HDR test, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab S 8.4 offers 180-degree pano shots and can snap those in both portrait and landscape modes. If you opt for the portrait orientation you'll get bigger field of view and higher resolution - about 10,000 x 2,000 compared to 10,000 x 1,000 px in landscape. The quality is great, and the stitching is near perfect.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab S 8.4 has an 8MP camera and its performance is pretty much on par with some of the best 8MP cameraphones out there .</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is capable of capturing 1080p videos. The video recorder is placed in the same interface as the still image capture. It is activated via a button which sits right above the one for the regular camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 have a good deal of resolved detail, steady framerate and little noise. Colors and white balance are similar to those in still images. The tablet can certainly give many cameraphones a run for their money.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 comes with the stock Android browser customized by Samsung and Google Chrome. Both support Multi-window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interfaces of both browsers are virtually identical. Tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser, and the address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field (with a voice input shortcut).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both browsers feature incognito tabs and request desktop view. Chrome has a Google-powered feature that sync open tabs between devices that run Chrome, but Samsung has integrated a similar feature into the stock browser it goes through your Samsung account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new tab section for each browser is dominated by thumbnails of the sites you visit most often. Bookmarks are also viewed as thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Additional apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android calendar has been replaced with S Planner (as usual). It offers great and user friendly interface and does an excellent job of keeping your events organized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual suspects - Flipboard, Dropbox (with 50GB for two years bonus), and Evernote are on board too. Samsung has neatly arranged all the premium bundled content into a section dubbed Galaxy Gifts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung WatchOn is on board too. It utilizes the built-in remote control in a superb fashion and seamlessly pairs with you TV and cable box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The productivity apps are from Hancom Office - Hword, Hcell and Hshow. They feature interfaces similar to the desktop Microsoft Office apps, meaning they are busy with tons of buttons. While they can be operated with a finger, we get the feeling it would be more comfortable to use a mouse with those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cisco WebEx handles conferencing and cam even share what's on your screen. It is one of the commonly used conferencing clients in the corporate world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bundled subscriptions with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 include Bloomberg Businessweek, The Wall Street Journal, The Economics, and The New York Times. Marvel Unlimited on the other hand, supplies you with free comics during your spare time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Paper Garden is an app which debuts with the Galaxy Tab S family. It is a product of a partnership between Samsung and the publishing powerhouse Cond?© Nast. The app features a storefront with access to the all publisher's titles which have been specially optimized for the Super AMOLED display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're going to connect a keyboard and mouse to the Galaxy Tab S 8.4, you can just as well launch the Remote PC app, which does just what it says on the tin. It gives you remote access to your home or office PC, which works rather well on the tablet's high-resolution screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other apps are included as well, like Bitcasa, which offers a lot more storage than Dropbox - a whopping 1TB - but the subscription is for three months only. Note that the RemotePC service is also subscription based (you get 2 years) and so are Evernote (3-12 month subscription, market dependent).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 could very well be the most capable compact tablet money can buy, regardless of the OS. The ultra-slim slate is certainly worthy of the S badge thanks to its gorgeous Super AMOLED display, powerful hardware, almost overwhelming set of features, as well as a great deal of bundled content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 key test findings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2560 x 1600 Super AMOLED screen is simply stunning in the flesh. Spending enough quality time with it is a pleasure regardless of the occasion. Speaking of occasions, the display can rise to any thanks to its different color modes - it can cater to both saturated color junkies and those who care to look at accurate hues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the hardware and the battery performance of the slate came out really stellar. This hardly caught us by surprise though - after all, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is a flagship tablet through and through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's latest TouchWiz iteration is user-friendly and suits the tablet quite well. The bundled premium subscription content will be particularly useful and money-saving, especially to the business crowd. The Kids Mode on the other hand will be helpful on other, more casual occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our biggest gripe with the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 has to do with the available color schemes at launch. Dazzling White and Titanium Bronze both feature a good deal of gold and are certain to be perceived as over the top by many, including us. We reckon that a black color scheme at launch would have done wonders for the tablet's prospects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of prospects, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is priced at $399.99 for a Wi-Fi-only version with 16GB of built-in memory. Over the first month of availability, the manufacturer will also throw in a flip cover to further sweeten the deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, here are some alternatives to the newcomer worth considering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the biggest rival to the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is the Apple iPad mini 2 with Retina display. Cupertino's offering loses out on display, internals, and additional hardware features, but looks more enticing with its all-metal body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad mini 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 runs iOS 7 (soon to be iOS 8), which is rich in tablet-friendly apps, particularly when it comes to entertainment. It is not as productive as the Samsung offering though - one thing it lacks split-screen multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is undeniably the closest thing to the Galaxy Tab S 8.4. Announced this January during CES, the Tab Pro 8.4 packs an LCD display of the same resolution as the newcomer, a bit less of RAM, no fingerprint scanner, and (unsurprisingly) similar design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is $70 cheaper than the Galaxy Tab S 8.4. The Super AMOLED display of the latter, as well as its thinner and lighter body however, should prompt you to fork out the extra cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE-capable version of the LG G Pad 8.3 is another, this time considerably more affordable option, but it's only available in the US by Verizon. That's probably the only other Android tablet in this size that we'd consider buying at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G Pad 8.3 LTE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is the biggest step yet by the manufacturer on its way to the top of the tablet market. It is also the first compact Android tablet which can legitimately give the iPad mini 2 a bloody nose not only on paper, but also in real life, without downplaying Google's and Amazon's efforts. But while the likes of Kindle and Nexus are good at cutting Apples' prices, Samsung is throwing everything and the AMOLED screen.</paragraph>
