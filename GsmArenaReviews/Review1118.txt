			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Following the success of the original DROID RAZR and its 3300mAh battery equipped DROID RAZR MAXX version, Motorola decided to add three new models tp the RAZR family. Launched at a glitzy event, starring members of Google's top brass, alongside the DROID RAZR HD and the DROID RAZR MAXX HD, the Motorola DROID RAZR M is the least expensive handset in the bunch. However, you shouldn't let this deceive you - the baby RAZR is one proper smartphone with lots of tricks up its sleeves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M packs the same internals as virtually every high-end Android device currently available in the United States. The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 silicon with dual-core Krait CPU is what powers all the US smartphone top dogs, including the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S III and the HTC One X for AT&amp;T, so we can already tell you that Motorola's latest mid-ranger won't be lacking oomph.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the full list of talents which the Motorola DROID RAZR M possesses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see above, the Motorola DROID RAZR M is brimming with cool features, despite its modest price tag. Even more impressively, Motorola's engineers have managed to fit a 4.3" display into a frame that rarely hosts screens bigger than 4". The frameless design of the display allows for a seamless one-handed operation of the device - a nice feat for a smartphone with a screen this size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the software's section, Google's influence is strongly felt. The smartphone comes with Google Chrome web browser preinstalled. Motorola's execs also promised an Android 4.1 Jelly Bean update to hit the DROID RAZR M before the end of 2012.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we are going to kick the review off with an unboxing of the Motorola DROID RAZR M, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Motorola DROID RAZR M is a US-only phone, so it will probably never get to the shores of the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A tiny retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like previous members of its family, the Motorola DROID RAZR M comes with a basic retail package. Inside the handset's small and stylish retail box, you will find a charger, a microUSB cable, as well as a tool for removing the SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again you will have to make do without a pair of headphones out of the box. Given the phone's acceptable price tag, you will likely have some spare change to grab a pair on your own, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality inspection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M looks quite similar to its predecessors, despite the slimmer guise. The chromed earpiece and Kevlar coated back hark back straight to the original. Having that in mind, we must note that the newcomer is a handsome looking fella.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice new touch to the handset's design is the presence of visible bolts on its sides. They give the DROID RAZR M an industrial look, as well as an added sense of craftsmanship, which is rarely seen in this price category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M is available in two colors - peal white like our review unit and black. The latter is definitely the more understated version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build materials are nothing short of superb. The Motorola DROID RAZR M is a blend of Kevlar, Corning Gorilla Glass, and high quality plastic. Even the pickiest user will hardly find something to complain about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned our positive impressions of the compactness of the Motorola DROID RAZR M body. They smartphone measures 122.5 x 60.9 x 8.3 mm and tips the scale at 126 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we told you, the display of the Motorola DROID RAZR M is a familiar sight. It is the same 4.3" PenTile Super AMOLED unit, found in the original DROID RAZR and RAZR MAXX. Contrast and sunlight legibility are phenomenal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PenTile matrix however does not befit the rest of the hardware. A ColorBoost unit would have been a much more welcome sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will find the usual bunch of sensors, the earpiece and front-facing camera, as well as a tiny but handy notification light. There's nothing but the earpiece and a Verizon logo below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port, microSIM, and microSD card slots are located on the Moto's left side. The card slots are both under the same cover. On the right side, you will find the power/lock key, as well as the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unprotected 3.5mm audio jack is located on the top of the Motorola DROID RAZR M. There's nothing on the device's bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera, its LED flash, and the loudspeaker are located at the top of the DROID RAZR M's splash resistant back. The usual set of Verizon logos can be found adorning the soft-feeling Kevlar as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a combination of a 2000mAh battery, a latest generation silicon, as well as an energy efficient display with fairly modest resolution, we expected the Motorola DROID RAZR M to do well in our battery test and for a good reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone managed an endurance rating of the almost unbelieavable 55h. This means that you will need to recharge your Moto every 55 hours if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, as well as video playback every day. Motorola made a serious commitment to great battery life at its RAZR event and it's great to see the RAZR M deliver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Motorola DROID RAZR M is a pleasure. The edgeless display allows for easy one-handed operation, while the grippy Kevlar coverd back makes accidental drops unlikely. You will find nothing to frown about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overally, the Motorola DROID RAZR M receives nothing but high marks for desgin and build quality. The same goes for the device's battery life. The screen could have done without a PenTile matrix, but is still adequate for the phone's price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the software talents of the entry-level DROID RAZR.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich with a light touch by Motorola<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, with very light customizations by Motorola. The overall Android experience is very close to the stock Android - starting from the on-screen Android buttons, all the way to the app drawer and its transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the handset in action below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first area the interface which has been customized by Motorola is the lock screen. Pressing on the round unlock button gives you option to access four different features of the device - you can unlock it, or go straight to telephony, text messaging or the camera apps. You can also turn the device's sound on and off from the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen consists of side-scrollable panes. Switching between them is seamless, save for the small indicator above the docked icons, which disappears when not needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding or removing a homescreen pane, you have two options - start with a blank or use a preset one. The preset ones are geared towards specific activities such as social networking, entertainment, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing homescreen panes is as easy as swiping them upwards. No surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a true Ice Cream Sandwich fashion, long pressing the homescreen gives you the option to change the handset's wallpapers. You can do so for both the lock and the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has been taken straight from the stock version of Android ICS. It features two tabs - Apps and Widgets - that house side-scrollable pages. If you scroll past the available apps you move into the Widgets tab. There's also a Google Play store shortcut next to the tabs, for quicker access to Android's app repository.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create folders in the familiar ICS way. All you have to do is swipe the icon over the one you want to pair it with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We must note that there aren't many preloaded widgets. However, Motorola's own Circles widget is one of the most comfortable ones we've encountered. It offers you access to the clock, weather in different cities, as well as a battery indicator. Customization is also possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the device's homescreen to the left reveals a menu with quick settings. From there, you can change the most commonly used connectivity settings such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. We found this shortcut particularly handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is taken straight from the stock ICS UI. It shows you icons next to the notification, such as the picture of the person who called or messaged you. There's a Settings shortcut to make up for the fact that you can't go Menu &gt; Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Recent apps list is stock ICS one - it displays thumbnails of the running application rather than its icon and it's a vertical, scrollable list. You can dismiss apps with a simple swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall user interface experience with the Motorola DROID RAZR M is quite pleasant. The UI has been customized lightly, but cleverly. This helps it retain a lot of pure Googleness to it - not a bad thing in our opinion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the DROID RAZR M is yet another example of Verizon Wireless doing its best to ruin a perfectly fine user experience. The amount of preinstalled, non-removable software is completely out of line. With the usual set of Verizon bloatware, you will find a number of non-removable shopping apps such as Amazon, Amazon MP3, and Zappos. We do believe that it is up to the user to decide whether or not he needs those.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chipset of the Motorola DROID RAZR M is the same as the one found in any top shelf device currently on the US market, including the Galaxy S III. With fewer pixels for its GPU to deal with, the DROID RAZR M posted truly impressive benchmark results, matching its competitors on virtually all occasions and even beating them at some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the web browser-based based benchmarks weren't quite so good. Motorola made a big deal about Google Chrome being the default browser and how fast it is, but our the RAZR M test results were less than impressive. Maybe Chrome is just unable to perform as well as expected outside of its natural Jelly Bean habitat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Motorola DROID RAZR M is mostly a standard Android ICS affair. The middle tab is the default - a list of all contacts. Contacts are listed with a name and a picture to the right. They can be sorted by first or last name and displayed with the first or last name first. The other two tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is really thumbs friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and drag to jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's a regular search too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any issues with the signal and call quality of the Motorola DROID RAZR M. As expected, the phone did a commendable job on this instance, thanks to Verizon's superb network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is enabled on the handset, which is great as it spares you the time to go into your phonebook or a specific contact widget to find a contact. It shows only one matching contact at a time - you can use the down arrow to reveal all the suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recent calls tab is straightforward in terms of functionality. The favorites tab is neat, as it allows you to dial the contacts with a single tap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is brimming with options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messaging is a standard ICS operation. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. You can select multiple threads to mass delete them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is organized like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are presented with two text input options out of the box. The first one is the standard Android ICS keyboard which is really good. The popular Swype keyboard is also preinstalled. In case these two don't cut it for you, the Google Play store is full of options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M is equipped with a stock Android ICS gallery. The Default view of the gallery is Albums - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, which are two per line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above each photo you have several sharing shortcuts and a delete button, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more option. The editor offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the strength of the effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock video player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of the DROID RAZR M is the stock Android one. It supports most popular video formats such as XviD and MKV. You can access the videos straight from the gallery app - there's no dedicated video player button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the Motorola DROID RAZR M (as the name suggests) is perfect for consumption of video content. Large files are also handled easily by the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard Android music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M comes with the latest Music app by Google. It has the same side-scrollable tabs like much of the other stuff in Ice Cream Sandwich. Naturally, it offers a link to the Google Play music store as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are used to organize your music library - there's Recent, Artists, Albums, Songs, Playlists and Genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface features the track's album art with the track info and playback controls below it. You can tap it to reveal more options - like/unlike the song, a bar to scrub through the song and shuffle and repeat toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets that along with a user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M fared greatly in our traditional audio quality test. The smartphone offers pretty good frequency response as well as excellent signal-to-noise and dynamic range scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo crosstalk is quite good as well, while the distortion levels are kept well under control. Add the excellent volume levels and you get a really solid overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M is equipped with an 8MP camera which takes photos with a maximum resolution of 3264x2448 pixels. It's accompanied by a single-LED flash to help out in low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is simple. On the right side of the viewfinder there's the virtual shutter key flanked by the front/back and photo/video toggles. On the left, there's the gallery shortcut that displays the thumbnail of the last photo taken (with a counter of remaining photos next to it) and the digital zoom slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a retractable row of shortcuts at the bottom - those include effects, scenes, shooting mode, exposure adjustment and flash control (on, off, auto).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From Modes, you can choose single shot, multi-shot (4MP photos), panorama or self-timer. Scenes offer things like Sport, Macro, HDR or an Auto mode which decides what's best without your explicit input. There's an option to geotag photos - that info can be stripped automatically when sharing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a widescreen option that produces 16:9 photos. With it, both the viewfinder and the gallery images fit the screen aspect perfectly in full screen mode. However, the 16:9 aspect ratio means the photos turn out at roughly three quarters of the original resolution at about 6MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures which the DROID RAZR M captures offer a good amount of detail, pleasant colors a little noise. Contrast could have been better though. The noise reduction is also a tad too aggressive - we found some of the fine bits in the photos smeared from the process.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M shoots 1080p videos at 30fps. The user interface looks identical to that of the still camera although some options have been changed. The Scenes option from the still camera has been replaced by Audio Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Stereo, Wind Reduction, Concert, Balanced and Front Facing audio scenes, which use the two microphones to adapt the audio to the specific situation. You still have the effects and exposure options and you can enable video stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in .MP4 files with bitrate hovering at 15Mbps. The sound that goes along with the video is stereo (128Kbps bitrate, 44.1kHz sampling rate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured by the DROID RAZR M came out great. The clips are smooth with good detail, contrast and colors. There is some visible fringing, but overall the smartphone is one of the better videographers we've seen lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of samples captured with the DROID RAZR M.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes an untouched 1080p video clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has you covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like a proper top shelf Android smartphone, the Motorola DROID RAZR M checks just about every box in the connectivity department. Along with the EVDO/CDMA network capacity, it offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band HSDPA potentially reaching speeds of up to 21 Mbps HSDPA, and 5.76 HSUPA. Sadly, the GSM capabilities are only available with Verizon's roaming outside the United States.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Verizon's superb LTE network connectivity is also on board. Where available, it is a pleasure to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity features include dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n (with DLNA support) and Bluetooth 4.0 with LE. The mobile hotspot functionality is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for wired connectivity, there's a microUSB port at your service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board with Android Beam preinstalled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is your default web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser. It offers arguably the best experience on Android, even though its speed marks left something to be desired. Still, we doubt it you will be looking too hard for the stock ICS browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having left the Beta realm for some time now, Google Chrome on your Moto syncs seamlessly with your desktop, thus allowing for easily switching tasks between your smartphone and any other device you have, running Google's browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top notch organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice is an excellent app that has support for viewing several file types - Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF. It can also edit and create new .DOC, .XLS and .PPT files (both 2003 and 2007 versions are supported). You have plenty of formatting options, inserting images, Excel formulas and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app defaults to a desk clock mode that looks a lot like the lockscreen. The best part here is that you can tap to turn the light almost all the way down - with only the time staying on the display just bright enough to see it (it's much easier to see in the dark). This is a very power-efficient mode and you can actually use the phone as a desk clock without worrying about killing the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual alarm functionality is still present - you can set multiple alarms, each with its own repeat pattern, ringtone and label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a file manager on board as well - it can browse both the internal 16GB memory and the microSD card. Also, there's support for browsing shared folders on the Wi-Fi network you're connected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a really clever app called Smart Actions - it allows you to create automatic actions triggered by different conditions you set. You can have the phone do various things (e.g. disable background sync, change screen brightness, display a notification to remind you of something, etc.). There are several sample actions that are useful in various situations but you can create your own from scratch too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline from the menu" and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to fit New York and some surrounding area before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with applications and video games, you can also access and purchase movies, music, books and magazines (where available).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola DROID RAZR M for Verizon Wireless shows how blurred the lines between mid-range and top shelf smartphones have come to be. In terms of performance, the little Moto outdid all the current US heavyweights. Only its screen prevents it from being dubbed as a proper flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like all recent Motorola smartphones, the DROID RAZR M is superbly put together and good looking. Ergonomics have been taken to a completely different level for a device with a screen this size. Up until the RAZR M's arrival one-handed operation on a smartphone with 4"+ screen was considered a hard task, but the compact fella handles like a much smaller device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we can live with the uninspiring (but still pretty good) screen of the DROID RAZR M, given its price tag, we can't say the same about the software experience. Verizon's involvement in what is otherwise a pleasant blend of Motorola customizations and pure Google is way too intrusive. We do not recall dealing with so much bloatware in the past - that includes Verizon devices too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola and Verizon are asking the highly-acceptable $99.99 for the DROID RAZR M. A quick look at Amazon Wireless however, and you can snag the device for cool 50 bucks with a two-year commitment. You will get a lot of smartphone for the money, even considering the handset's software woes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are willing to shop around however, here are some nice alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix HD for AT&amp;T is an obvious one. It beats the Verizon offering with a stunning 4.55" HD display with ColorBoost technology. You will however have to make do with a 1780mAh battery, whose performance is nowhere near as good as that of the baby RAZR juice pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola ATRIX HD MB886</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One S for T-Mobile and HTC DROID Incredible 4G LTE are also part of the compact Snapdragon S4 club. Both devices will require you to make even more compromises than with the Motorola thought.
