			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>From an experimental niche product to standard-setter in just three generations. The Note 3 boasts a beautiful large screen, cutting edge tech and hardware design that shows Samsung is finally taking looks seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note family is credited with not only starting the phablet craze, but also resurrecting the stylus. The S Pen is no ordinary stylus though - the special screen digitizer and a button on the S Pen work their magic to augment the thumb-on-screen experience, and rival it in terms of speed and options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the Galaxy Note 3 phablet continues the tradition of being the current generation's Galaxy S phone on steroids - a large 5.7" screen (in a body the size of the Note II), choice of Snapdragon 800 or Exynos 5420 chipsets, 2160p (a.k.a. UHD) video recording, USB 3.0 (a first on a pocketable device) and Samsung's ever-growing list of software features available right out-of-the-box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides putting the Exynos-powered model in question, the list of disadvantages is grasping at straws - Samsung went all out with the Galaxy Note 3 and may well have created the best Android device to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, it's large but ask anyone who has used a 5.5+ inch device - it takes a while to get used to, but after that regular phones feel like tiny toys. And it's not that big - it's the same size as the Note II except thinner and lighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone launches with the latest Android version available - 4.3 Jelly Bean - on which Samsung has grafted its government-approved security feature called Knox. Samsung is aiming hard for the "bring your own device to work" business crowd that BlackBerry and its secure services have now lost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It helps that Samsung decided to quell the "glossy plastic" complaints with a surprising move to a faux-leather look that feels almost like the real thing - instead of being tacky, it adds a touch of class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also invites power users to the Galaxy Note 3 with tons of bespoke features, customization options, easy expansion with a removable battery and card slot, not to mention two of the most powerful mobile chipsets available. The 2160p (or UHD) video capture is nearly unique and with millions of Note 3s to be sold, Samsung is setting up nicely for its UHD 4K TVs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the bulging list of features, we have plenty of ground to cover, so let's get started with a peek at the design on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Galaxy Note 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes in a box not much taller or wider than the phablet itself. It's Samsung's usual green box - as in eco-friendly, not the color. The color is brownish, which Samsung makes look attractive with a subtle wood texture pattern printed in soy-based ink. The manuals are recycled paper and soy ink too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the box holds the regular accessories - a powerful 2A charger, a cable and a headset. The cable looks unusual because it's a microUSB 3.0. Common microUSB 2.0 cables will work too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headset is an in-ear design, the remote has three buttons (answer and volume controls) and flat, tangle-free cables.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 measures 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3mm - surprisingly, it's smaller than its predecessor whose dimensions were 151.1 x 80.5 x 9.4mm. Slimming down the bezels has allowed Samsung to stretch the screen an extra 0.2", the 5.7" is around 7% bigger than the old 5.5" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more slender body is lighter too, at 168g the Note 3 is fairly close to the weight of a much smaller phone (and some regular phones are heavier).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes in a more refined finish than last year's Note. The shape is more angular while the body has almost entirely lost its glossy hyperglazed finish. Samsung has opted instead for plastic that emulates leather and metal. With Note 3's business aspirations, this more mature look is quite welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of the Note 3 is plastic even if most of it doesn't feel like it. The plastic around the screen is matte and has a brushed metal texture to it and comes in the standard Jet Black, Classic White and Blush Pink colors (don't worry, if you want more hues there are plenty of back covers to choose from). The sides have what looks like a grooved metal strip, but that's plastic too. The grooves are not only an attractive design accent, but they also positively improve grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is the biggest change in the Note design and one we heartily approve of. Faux-leather with faux-stitches sounds like a tacky idea, but the execution feels close enough to real leather that it's one of the best backs on a mobile device. And unlike aluminum or glass, this plastic will still handle - and hide - damage very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Galaxy Note II, the Note 3 is over a millimeter thinner (8.3mm vs. 9.4mm) and it's lighter too - 168g (down from 183g). We've handled phones that weigh more than this. The Note 3 is also over a millimeter narrower and virtually the same height as the Note II - room was made for the bigger screen at the expense of bezel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 feels big in the hand but by no means too big or too heavy. If you're using a Note II, the third-gen model will actually feel smaller. The jump from a 5" screen to the Note 3 is smaller than you would imagine too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, one handed operation is almost impossible for people with small hands but for regular phablet users the Note 3 is just the right size. There are also a number of options to resize UI elements and improve one-handed use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen has had a nice update as well, making it usable with the capacitive buttons so now you can navigate the Galaxy Note 3 using the stylus only. The new S Pen enables several great shortcuts, so using the stylus might actually be faster for certain tasks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the 5.7" display you'll find the earpiece, a 2 MP front-facing camera capable of 1080p video recording, the proximity sensor, ambient light sensor and the motion sensor, which is responsible for all the air gestures (aside from Quick Glance, which relies on the proximity sensor).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, we find the typical Samsung three button layout consisting of a physical Home button with capacitive Back and Menu keys each side. As usual the home button has an aluminum frame for a subtle accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Galaxy Note 3 are nothing out of the ordinary in terms of controls. There's the power/lock button on the right hand side on which the thumb nicely rests and the volume rocker on the left. The volume rocker could have been lowered a little bit so as to be more easily accessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 is the first mobile device to feature USB 3.0 using the micro version of the port. The connection consists of two parts - one that is compatible with microUSB 2.0 and one that adds additional pins for faster data transfers. Also at the bottom is one of the mics, the loudspeaker grille and the S Pen compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top features another mic and the 3.5mm audio jack, plus the IR blaster that Samsung has been putting on some Galaxy devices lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we get to the back, which (and we're not exaggerating here) is a massive improvement over the Note II. With the Galaxy Note 3, Samsung is sticking to plastic, but this time around it has a great-looking leather texture. Best of all it feels similar to actual leather rather than a tacky imitation, and the faux-stitching is a great touch, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing we like about the leather texture is that unlike the glossy hyperglazed plastic, it doesn't become a smudgy, slippery mess as soon as you touch the device. We hope Samsung releases a similar cover for the Galaxy S4 as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pop the back cover open to reveal the 3,200mAh battery (we were hoping for a bigger bump in capacity) along with the microSIM and microSD card slots. The slots are stacked on top of each other like they were on the Galaxy Mega 6.3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom slot holds the microSIM card, which is blocked by the battery, while the top slot is for the microSD card, which can be removed even with the battery in place. The Note 3 comes in 32GB and 64GB versions, but with a microSD card slot we doubt many people will go for the 64GB option.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the highlight feature alongside the S Pen support. The diagonal has been bumped by 0.2" (from 5.5" to 5.7"), while the resolution has more than doubled (1080 x 1920, up from 720 x 1280) resulting in a pixel density of 386ppi, which effectively (for the first time in Note history) crosses the Retina 300ppi threshold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display technology is, again, Super AMOLED but Samsung has abandoned the RGB design from the Note II and gone for a diamond-shaped PenTile matrix instead. However, at these insane pixel density levels there's no visible pixilation whatsoever, even if you have 20/20 vision.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how what those layouts look under a microscope. The diamond PenTile matrix uses OLED sub-pixels of different sizes as each color has different levels of power efficiency and longevity. Sub-pixel rendering is employed to properly distribute each of the primary colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 display matrix compared to the Note II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different sub-pixel sizes and PenTile arrangements of a typical AMOLED throw its white balance off, but if you set the Galaxy Note 3 screen on Movie mode it sticks faithfully to sRGB - this includes not only white balance, but also color saturation. Professional Photo Mode uses the wider Adobe RGB instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is among the best we've seen. It has practically infinite contrast, impeccable viewing angles and colors that pop out of the frame like nothing else. Samsung has even made sure the wallpapers available are playing the color saturation up, but in a good way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite some excellent LCDs in top-tier smartphones these days, it's hard to match the Super AMOLED's amazing imagery and deep blacks. The innate lower reflectivity of AMOLED translates in superior sunlight legibility but more on that a little later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, let's look at the numbers. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3, as we said, has a practically unlimited contrast ratio, as individual pixels don't get lit up - AMOLEDs light up only the parts of the screen that display a different color beside black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Super AMOLED panel on the Galaxy Note 3 isn't the brightest we've seen, it's actually inferior to the Galaxy S4. However in most cases you won't notice this in practice unless you put the Note 3 side by side with an HTC One or iPhone 5. Note that Auto Brightness mode can set the brightness higher than you can with the brightness slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under direct sunlight the Galaxy Note 3 is able to retain excellent contrast and stay legible even in the most brightly lit environments. The Galaxy Note 3 was able to match the Apple iPhone 5 and retain the third spot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Pen and S View cover<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Pen can be placed back into its compartment either side up, the button facing up or down. The stylus is made of matte plastic, with a finely grooved top part that matches the sides of the Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new S Pen is about the same size as the Note II's S Pen - only no longer round but flattened instead. The flat sides of the stylus actually allow an even more comfortable grip. The button is positioned on one of those flat sides and is easy to reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also received one of the S View Covers for the Note 3 (note that these are not part of the retail package, but are sold separately). It's even more rectangular than the phablet and looks a lot like a leather-bound notebook except for the window. That window measures around 60 x 60mm (2.36"), much bigger than the window on Galaxy S4's S View Covers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use this window with your fingers or with the S Pen - you can jot down a quick Action Memo, launch the camera and take a photo or control the music player all without opening the cover. When you do open the cover, the screen unlocks automatically (unless you have enabled one of the security lockscreen features).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S View Cover replaces the cover on the back of the Galaxy Note 3 to minimize the impact on thickness and weight. The window on this cover (as well as the S4 covers) has a thin plastic film that protects the screen underneath, unlike LG's QuickView covers where the window is just a cutout that exposes a portion of the actual screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go for the Wallet Flip Cover, which is the same but without the window. This cover earns its name because of a small slot where you can put a credit card or some cash.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The modest increase in battery capacity was a bit of a question mark hanging over the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, considering the screen resolution has more than doubled. Yet, the 3,200mAh battery powering the whole thing (up from 3,100 in the Note II) did quite well. The power-efficient Super AMOLED screen was made to count in video-playback and helped the Note 3 achieve an excellent score despite the huge estate to light up. Talk time is great too, web browsing the only element where the Note 3 failed to show a meaningful improvement over its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, with an overall rating of 75 hours, the Note 3 is well ahead of the other phablets we've tested so far. What this number means is that the Note 3 should manage three full days on a single charge if used for one hour each of calls, web browsing and video playback daily.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz on the big canvas<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean - the latest release of the Google platform available at the moment - and a laundry list of new TouchWiz features. The Galaxy Note 3 combines the best of both worlds and while it seems familiar, there's plenty new below the surface - so much in fact that you'd need a couple of days just to get to know all the features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a user interface video to start you off, which also shows the new air and motion gestures in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the lockscreen, which features the widgets introduced with Android 4.2.2, that we saw on the Galaxy S4. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message overlaid on beautiful photos pulled from TripAdvisor (with text at the bottom about where the photo was taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose what effect to add to the unlocking. The options include Oil paint and watercolor, which blur the color on screen as if you were dragging a wet paint brush through the screen. You can also opt for the well-known ripple and light effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in pure Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the greeting message on the lockscreen by hitting the edit button. You can type something else, choose a different font and color. You can also disable the personal message altogether and remove the time and date info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice trick is the Quick glance option we first saw on the Galaxy Note II. It uses the proximity sensor to detect you reaching for the device and it lights up the screen and shows the time, missed call and message counters, battery charge and music track info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is business as usual and hasn't seen any changes. At the top there are five (or eight in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. There are more than five toggles, of course, you can swipe horizontally to get to the others. Or you can tap the expand button, which reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, 22 in total. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can remove this slider to get more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks mostly the same if you're coming from a Galaxy S4. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub, S Travel, etc. There's wrap around feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode with all homescreen panes visible simultaneously. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button - you can choose a different homescreen as the default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changed too much since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders. You can also disable apps straight from the App drawer, which is a good feature because they won't take any RAM or appear unwanted in the Task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also maximize space in the app drawer by stacking apps into folders. You can either drag icons on top of each other in edit mode or you can check multiple app via the create folder option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works the same as on a homescreen - it gives you a glance overview of all panes as thumbnails. You can choose to have your app drawer ordering to custom, alphabetical grid or alphabetical list. There's a dedicated downloaded pane too, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can judge how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 comes with Multi-window which now allows launching two instances of the same app - i.e. you can have two Chrome windows next to each other. There is also dedicated shortcut that lets you switch the places of the two opened apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Copying stuff from one of the opened apps to the other is now available and is done in just three taps. It's a definite improvement and something the multi-window feature needed badly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed there is pretty decent app support for the multi-window service at launch with even more supported apps on the way. It's a feature that will be used really often and we are happy to see Samsung extending its support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can move the small arrow that brings up the drawer with the Multi-window apps to make it easier to reach with your thumb. You can also move the whole drawer to the other side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu has been redone in the latest TouchWiz version. Instead of a scrollable grid of icons and sections Samsung has went with a tabbed interface. On top you get four tabs - Connection, My device, Accounts and More and you can find the relative features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the My device tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes navigating the settings menu much faster and more intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A particularly cool feature that is exclusive to the Galaxy Note 3 is the one-hand operation. Unlike previous versions of the feature, though, it is not limited to the keypad and the calculator. This time you can minimize the whole interface with a simple double swipe and you are effectively making the Galaxy Note 3 use only a corner of its screen for its UI. The volume buttons are also brought to the tip of your fingers so you can operate the handset as if it was a 4" (or slightly more - custom resizing is available) rather than 5.7" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's a really useful feature and will be appreciated by all those that love the huge screen and its excellent multimedia performance, but need to be able to operate their smartphones with one hand frequently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like what Samsung has done with the latest iteration of TouchWiz. Despite pilling feature upon feature, the end result does not feel cluttered and intuitive and well organized. Placing widgets, rearranging menu and homescreen panes, getting to your important settings, etc. is now faster than ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also very responsive, thanks to the superb hardware inside. Everything happens instantaneously and there is no lag to be spotted whatsoever.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S-Pen, Air and Motion gestures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now let's talk about the new S-Pen features. You'll find pretty much every S-Pen-enabled app that premiered with the previous Notes pre-installed on the Note 3. But once you pull the S-Pen out, you won't be greeted with the old S-Pen dedicated home pane. Instead, the OS will pop up the new Air Command menu. The new menu is available everywhere throughout the UI too, you just need to press the side button on the S-Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Air Command menu is a virtual ring with five shortcuts - Action Memo, Scrap Booker, Screen Write, S Finder and Pen Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Memo lets you write stuff and then use it to initiate an action - i.e. add a contact name and number to your phonebook, or check out an address on Google Maps. You just need to mark a part of the text and send it to one of the supporting apps. The handwriting recognition works impressively fast and accurately - it handles just about everything you throw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrap Booker lets you add pieces of your screen to... well, a Scrapbook. You don't need to take a full screenshot - just mark the stuff you need. The Scrap Booker will automatically extract pictures and text from the selected area and will save them to one of your Scrapbook categories. You can then add an optional memo to every scrapbook entry you create.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen Write allows you to start writing on the display no matter what screen you are on. You can either use a clean sheet or use a snapshot of the screen you are currently using. It's the best tool for taking quick memos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Search is a local search that'll browse through all the content on your Note 3 with preset filters. It can search in all S-Pen content you've added (including notes, scrapbook pages, etc.), messages, multimedia, settings, phonebook, even the internet. Naturally, all handwritten stuff is an easy job for the S-Search. You can even search for symbols you've drawn with the S-Pen. That last one seems to work quite slowly, however, and unless you actually use the scrapbook quite a lot you probably won't need it that often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last element of the Air Command menu is Pen Window. It lets you launch a mini window with one of the supported apps by drawing a rectangle on the screen. The Galaxy Note 3 will then fit the floating app in said rectangle (correcting the aspect, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video showing how these new Air Commands work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Note is an application that allows you to create and customize notebooks. There is a total of 9 preset notebooks to choose from but you can also create your own custom look from images in your gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After you're done creating a notebook you can go ahead and fill it with notes, drawings, images on which you can draw or doodle, etc. The app gives you a nice little preview of the notes inside a notebook when you swipe it down in the main window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside a note you can choose from a variety of pens and brushes, adjust the color and thickness of the line, insert text in a number of fonts, make the text bold or italic, etc. You can create custom shapes, have an undo and redo option and choose to delete whole lines or just parts of the content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can insert just about anything into a note - voice memos, images, video, charts or illustrations, maps, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrapbook lets you keep any content you browse through on the Note 3's screen. You need to select anything on the screen of the Note 3 by pressing the S Pen button and the software highlights it and gives you a prompt to send it to Scrapbook via an image. Air Command also gives you a shortcut to Scrapbook and lets you highlight anything on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add notes to a scrapped image as well as tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app lets you import images from your phone or SD card storage and sync with your Samsung account but to our disappointment won't let you sync your scraps and tags to Evernote, Springpad, Google Keep, or any other third party app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with a number of other advanced features enabled by the powerful hardware and dedicated sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is Air View, which debuted on the Galaxy Note II and worked with the S Pen. Just like before when you're hovering the S Pen or finger over text or image, email, the software responds and brings you a larger pop up version of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is called information preview (e.g. SMS text, calendar entry text and so on). It also works for previewing videos just by pointing to a spot in the timeline, and it lets you checking out the next track in the music player by hovering over the next button (available with the previous button too). There's also the use for for previewing folders, speed dial contacts, and magnifying links in web pages. Air view detects fingers or the S Pen around 3cm away from the screen, so there's no danger of accidentally tapping the screen when you wanted to use Air View instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another set of "air" features are the Air Gestures. Quick Glance is one of them, but there's more. The rest of the air commands are triggered by waving your hand over the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use waving to scroll web pages in the browser (vertical waves), switch between tabs (horizontal waves), move between tracks in the music player and photos in the gallery, accept a call and move app shortcuts and S Planner events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air Gestures can detect your hand up to 7cm away from the screen (just under 3") and might prove useful in some situations. Note that only the native apps support those, third party ones are a no-go (even Chrome that comes preinstalled on the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Smart Stay and Smart Rotate features are enabled too. Stay prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face (great for reading) and Rotate uses the orientation of your face rather than accelerometer info to decide how to rotate the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Scroll is yet another feature that leverages on the front-facing camera - it allows you to scroll up and down by tilting the phone or by tilting your head. It's a bit hard to get used to it initially, but once you do it's rather useful for certain scenarios - particularly when your other hand is busy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final Samsung-exclusive feature is dubbed Smart Pause. While watching a video, it uses the front-facing camera to track your face and will automatically pause the video when you look away. Look back and the screen and the playback continues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are a number of motion gestures, which are not exactly new. There's direct call (dial the contact currently displayed on the screen by lifting the phone up to your ear), smart alert (makes the phone vibrate when you pick it up if there are missed events), zooming and panning in the gallery, a shake of the phone to refresh the list of Bluetooth devices and muting alarms or pausing music playback by putting the phone face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pause the music player by putting your palm on the screen. A palm swipe takes a screenshot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and is present on the Galaxy Note 3. S Voice can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual phone and it has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy Note 3 to answer a call, snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The only problem with S Voice is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, being a Jelly Bean smartphone, the Galaxy Note 3 also comes with Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of sports teams you follow, gives you the weather forecast for your city and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget on the homescreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 is the first Samsung device we test, running on the Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 800 chipset. It is powered by a quad-core 2.3GHz Krait 400 processor, with Adreno 330 graphics and has 3GB of RAM - the most of any smart device on the market right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.3GHz Krait 400 processor (2.27GHz as per GeekBench), is the fastest on the market, also available in the LG G2 clocked at 2.26GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first test is all about single-core performance, where the Galaxy Note 3 shares the first spot with the LG G2. The Galaxy Note 3 and G2's Krait 400 cores run at about 100MHz higher than the rest of the Snapdragon 800 competition, which explains why they managed to beat their Sony peers by a hair.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, we put all four cores to the test in the multi-thread version of the Linpack benchmark. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 once again topped our result table, even though things were pretty close.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GeekBench 3 CPU benchmark is where the Galaxy Note 3 readily flexes some muscle to emphatically outdo its competitors. This achievement is somewhat disputed due to recent revelations about Samsung, among others, sexing up their benchmark results by running all cores at full throttle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What they do is disable the lower-clock modes on all CPU cores ? whether or not this is cheating considering benchmarks are all about theoretical maximum performance is something everyone should judge for themselves. Anyway, LG was obviously doing the same with the G2, and yet the Galaxy Note 3 managed to comfortably beat it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant and AnTuTu 4 gauge the overall device performance instead of just the CPU and the Galaxy Note 3 managed to conquer the first spot on AnTutu beating the Xperia Z1 by just a few points.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On Quadrant though, Xperia Z1 remained the champ, while the Galaxy Note 3 had to settle for second.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We move on to GPU trials and the Galaxy Note 3 aced both offscreen tests of the GFX Benchmark. Perhaps the extra RAM also allowed the Koreans to reserve more memory for the Adreno 330, resulting in its superior performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The updated Epic Citadel benchmark has the new Ultra High Quality setting and we've re-tested every 1080p device we possibly could. Strangely, the Galaxy Note 3 failed to match the rest of the Snapdragon 800 gang, achieving just under 48 fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is definitely one of the most powerful pieces of hardware in the market, but the rest of the Snapdragon 800 gang are breathing down its neck. Just like the rest of its siblings in chipset, the Galaxy Note 3 has processing power to spare and will breeze through any task. With a screen this size, 3GB of RAM and the multi-view feature, the Note 3 is arguably the greatest multi-tasker around.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Superb phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 packs an incredibly wide range of features. The four tabs on top are still present and provide access to the Phone app, Groups, Contacts and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has kept the swipes in the phonebook, enabling quick dialing (right swipe) or sending a text message (left swipe), which are really handy on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contacts feature, upon a tap on the contact picture, shows a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, text, email or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all the details available. There are two tabs here - the first one is the About tab, which shows the person's photo on top. If configured, the right tab displays their latest updates from social networks or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. You can use the back button to go to the full contact list, or tap in the top left corner, just like in vanilla Android. The top right corner has shortcuts to contact editing and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the phone book finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt you to join them. Furthermore, there are a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like the previous version of TouchWiz, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reject list blocks certain numbers from calling you. It works great with preset numbers and you can also bar unknown numbers. There are third party blacklist apps in the Play Store but it's nice to have this out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a specific vibration pattern as an incoming call alert, just like you would select a custom a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too. You can also assign a custom vibration to specific contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the Galaxy Note 3 is really something. It's almost too advanced for some users but its interfaces is simple enough so you can only use the features you need. Once you find your feet around you will appreciate having cool extras like call barring, which stock and most other forms of Android lack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with all the bells and whistles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 offers top notch quality and didn't run into any issues to sustain reception. Earpiece volume is great and voice quality was excellent with Samsung's in-call equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone app on the Galaxy Note 3 has been slightly redesigned but all the functionality is there. Smart Dial is available and works as advertised - it searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Direct Call is here too and lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts or reading/composing a message. If you use quick dial but forgot which contact is assigned to which number, you can use Air View as a quick reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too and taken care of by the newly added S Voice, which activates on a double tap of the home button. All you need to say is "Hi Galaxy" and speak your command (e.g. "call Dexter").. It takes a while to process voice commands but it has more uses than other voice-recognition apps for Android. Another way to answer a call is to wave your hand over the phone (that's another Air Gesture).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off when you hold it next to your ear during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 through our loudspeaker test and were pleased with the results. It's extremely loud and even managed to slightly top the HTC One's dual front speakers. While the One produces deeper sound the Galaxy Note 3 is louder. You can find more about the testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging with room for customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward and hasn't been fiddled with too much in the latest TouchWiz version. The user interface is simple: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard of the Galaxy Note 3 is mostly the same as on the Galaxy Note II. It displays an additional row above the letters for numbers - kind of like a full-fledged computer keyboard does and we found that to be really convenient and a great way to leverage on the huge screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a built-in Swipe-like mode which tracks your finger and guesses the word you're trying to type. This feature works great but has limited language support for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool option is the floating keyboard that takes up less space on the screen and can be moved around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're not too keen on on-screen keyboard, you can utilize the power of the S-Pen and use it for text input. Samsung has integrated a feature across the entire user interface, which enables any text field to accept handwriting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hovering with the S-Pen on any text field displays a handwriting icon; tap it, and use the S-Pen to write a message or put down a phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use S Voice to dictate your message or use Google's built-in voice recognition software if you don't feel like typing. Since this is a Jelly Bean device, you can also use voice typing without a data network connection, as long as you have downloaded the necessary language packs in advance. Samsung also provides the option to change the default input method.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has left a lot of room for customizing your messaging experience. You can choose from different bubbles and background and can use the volume button to increase or decrease the font in conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However you don't get the option to choose your own colors for either the conversation bubble which we would've liked to see. The background can be changed according to your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're composing a new message you can use the Translate option to translate it into another language. The same goes for messages you've received. This feature probably won't see much use but it's there you ever need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What might see more use, is the Direct call feature. When you are reading a message from someone, you can automatically call them back by just lifting the phone up to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the dialer, the Messaging app has built-in blacklist. You can block some numbers (or all unknown numbers) and even add specific phrases to be blocked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has grown handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen but is mostly unchanged. It supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a specific message will archive it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Email app can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email app supports Air view, which upon a hover over an email gives you a peek into said email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper-left corner you'll find a context menu prompt, which lists all your folders. It's not accessible through a swipe from the side so you'll need to tap the mail icon each time you want to gain access to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone landscape activates the split view - the left side of the screen shows the list of emails, while the right side shows a message. This is the same kind of interface we've seen on the Galaxy Tab though the bigger screen there made it actually useful - half of even a 5" screen isn't enough for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is alive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Note 3 has a new layout. It can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. There's also a spiral option, which revamps the gallery into a Scalado-like spiral of images and video, which after a while might even get a bit nauseating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails. Air view works in the gallery as well. You can hover your finger above an image and you'll get a bigger thumbnail preview of the image or you can use it to peek inside folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that albums' stack of photos but a swipe to the right will reveal a bar on the left with all the albums. This means you can change albums without going through the gallery homescreen every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a press and hold on a picture the gallery gives you the option to select multiple images, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is a joy. The screen is ample and the Super AMOLED can give you colors punchier than anything else on the market. If you know what "color profile" is you can enable the Adobe RGB screen mode for accurate color rendering, if not you can just enjoy the vibrant colors of the default setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily retouch photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also make a memo on top of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The My Files app hasn't changed a great deal - it is an efficient and simple to use file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player has folder support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy Note 3 is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC and Wave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album and Playlist criteria but there's also Folder support (which is more often found on third party players) - it's quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on many of the Galaxy Note 3 competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled equalizer presets that simulate the environment that you're in. Unlike earlier versions of the music player, on the Galaxy Note 3 you can choose only the effect that you wish to be simulated (Tube amp effect, Virtual 7.1 channel, Concert Hall, etc.)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options - a timescroll of the song, play/pause and back/forth controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a couple of features that will improve your listening experience further. One is Smart Sound, which equalizes the volume between tracks. The other is Adapt Sound - it plays a series of beeps (both high and low frequency) and asks if you can hear them. This way the phone can map the capacities of your specific headset and fine-tune its output for optimal sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the calibration is complete, the Galaxy Note 3 shows you the kind of gain you're receiving by keeping Adapt Sound on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The best video player in business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The best video player found on smartphones just got better. The new video player, found on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has the last watched video on top for quick access. Under it there are three tabs - personal (showing you the videos on your local storage), Download (which lets into the Videos store) and Nearby devices, which shows the PCs and players on your local Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is our favorite as it is really highlights the power of the the quad-core beast - the visible video thumbnails are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate and generating those previews takes a couple of minutes the first time around, but it's an awesome feature that shows what can be done when you have processing power to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too. The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the large, high-res screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chapter preview detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hovering your finger over the timescroll lets you preview part of the video in a small thumbnail - just like YouTube videos do when you hover the mouse of your computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is here too - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video are move it around, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Spotless audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 showed exceptionally clean audio output in our audio quality test. The phablet posted some of the best scores we have seen in both parts of the test and garnished them with decent volume levels. It's not the loudest we have seen, but it's loud enough for 99% of the occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressively, there's virtually no distortion when you plug in a pair of headphones. Except for the minor bump in stereo crosstalk the output is barely affected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13 MP stills are great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with the same 13 MP snapper that we found and loved on the Galaxy S4 but with some additional perks, like the Photo Sphere-like Surround Shot. The 13MP camera is good for photos of up to 4128 x 3096 pixels in its native 4:3 aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is based on the Galaxy Camera interface. A single viewfinder handles both still and video capture, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution as, if you're shooting full resolution 13MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The majority of the settings is located in the top left corner. Still, there a number of interesting options here like the setting for the volume rocker to act as a still shutter key, a video shutter key or a zoom lever. The HDR mode (Rich Tone) can be set to save a normal and an HDR photo or just the HDR one. Another interesting option is contextual file names - the Galaxy S4 will name photos with your location (the GPS needs to be on for this to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the cooler settings are found in two places. The first is the Mode button under the shutter keys. It brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each mode comes with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops he text but is faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other one is the arrow at the bottom of the screen, which brings up a row of color effects. Each effect gets a live preview, so you can see what the particular scene will look like with it. There's a download button so you can grab more effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the shooting modes we've seen on previous Samsung phones like Best Photo and Best Face, which snap multiple photos and let you pick the best one (in the case of Best Face, you can tweak each face in the photo individually). Beauty Shot does some automatic beauty touch up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we get into the more interesting shots. Surround shot is Samsung's name for Photo Sphere, which creates a spherical panorama, similar to those in Street View. Eraser helps you remove moving objects (e.g. tourist waling into your shot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drama mode takes a moving object and clones it several times. Note that the resolution for this mode drops to 1080p. Another way to capture moving objects is Cine Photo, which creates cinemagrams. The result is an animated GIF file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound &amp; shot captures a photo and records ambient sound. It sounds pretty cool - for example, you can hear the sea gulls in a beach photo or the roaring of car engines if you're at a race - but we had problems sharing the shot. All the Galaxy Note 3 would send is the still image, a JPEG, and the sound remains on the phone. Shame that Samsung didn't use the standard Audio note feature of JPEG photos for this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One important shooting mode that's not found in the carousel is double shot. It snaps a photo with both the front and the back cameras, so the person holding the phone can be in the shot too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now to the most important part - image quality. If you were happy with the Samsung Galaxy S4's excellent 13 MP snapper then you will love the Galaxy Note 3 snapper. Images have a lot of detail in them even in less than perfect weather (cloudy weather) noise is kept well under control. White balance is pretty natural and colors nice and punchy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR stills come out great as well. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 does well to develop the highlights that would otherwise be clipped, while shadows are only improved slightly, so contrast is still great and images don't look too flat or unrealistic. HDR images have an excellent amount of fine detail, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panoramas on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 can go as high as around 60 MP but only if you shoot in portrait mode as the images come out just over 3000 px tall, while in landscape panorama shooting you're getting an average of around 1600 px, which isn't ideal. In either mode you can shoot images around 19-20000 px wide. The stitching is seamless and the software uses the gyroscope and accelerometer to guide you and warn you if you're going too fast or moving off the right line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's another sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 camera performance in perspective we did an impromptu shootout between it and the LG G2 smartphone. LG G2 has a similar (if slightly wider) field of view and identical resolution so the two are easy to compare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On paper the G2 has the advantage of OIS, but since we used a tripod for the shots that didn't help it here. The two contestants were virtually on par, with the amount of detail about even on the two shots. The Galaxy Note 3 applies more aggressive sharpening, which makes its images appear sharper, but also has a dash more artifacts. The LG G2 has slightly more noise too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo comparison tool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is more than capable of carrying its own weight in our Photo Comparison tool. We've selected the excellent LG G2 and Galaxy S4 13 MP shooters to rival it and the fight is certainly fierce.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>4K video recording in a class of its own<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (the Snapdragon 800 edition) premiers 2160p video capture, more commonly referred to as UHD 4K or just 4K. It translates to videos of 3840 x 2160 resolution, or in other words, four times the resolution of 1920 x 1080 FullHD clips. The latter is also available on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 in standard 30 frames per second mode along with the smooth 1080p@60fps video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that in 4K video shooting you can't use Dual Shot mode and doesn't allow stills capture during recording, while in 1080p recording you can snap full-res 8 MP 16:9 aspect images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>30 fps FullHD videos carry the bitrate of around 16 Mbps, while 60fps movies take about 30Mbps. Audio is captured at 122 Kbps with a sampling rate of 48 kHz with 2 channels (read stereo). The more interesting 2160p video recording mode carries a very high 47 Mbps bitrate (almost three times that of 1080p videos) for the same 30 fps framerate. Audio is recorded with a bitrate of 123 Kbps with the same 48 kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During 1080p video recording you can zoom up to 4x times with the Galaxy Note 3 retaining the same quality up to 2x zoom (because the camera is capable of the double 2160p resolution). Beyond the 2x zoom, things start to downgrade rather quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the 2160p video sample. The detail levels are very high, which coupled with the immense resolution makes the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 truly the best camcorder smartphone out there. The quality of the Galaxy Note 3 4K videos is so good that in good light each of its frames has more detail than, say, the HTC One's 4 MP stills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things follow suit with the 1080p video recording. Aside from the obvious resolution drop the video carries the same great qualities - high detail levels and nicely rendered colors as well as consistent framerate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here you can check out the zooming capabilities of the Galaxy Note 3 during 1080p video recording. First we zoom all the way up to 4x where things look rather poo, but once we back up to 2x we basically get the same quality as non-zoomed 1080p footage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched 1080p @ 60fps (5 seconds, 18.9MB) video sample taken straight off the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity chock-full of new technology<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has an impressively long list of connectivity features. Let's start off with the basics - quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G (AWS is missing though). The 3G connectivity is backed by HSDPA (42Mbps downlink, 5.76Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 3 has an LTE-A-enabled version too, which uses the Snapdragon 800 chipset (the Exynos 5 Octa 5420 comes without 4G). The LTE-A speeds are 150Mbps down and 50Mbps up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers a/b/g/n as well as the latest ac standard, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA are part of the package, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third-generation phablet also has Bluetooth 4.0 LE. It incorporates Bluetooth 3.0, but also includes the efficient Low Energy mode. It also supports the high-quality Apt-X audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 lets you share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the devices back-to-back. You'd need two S Beam-enabled devices to get this to work. You can share with other NFC devices as well, but the functionality is limited to what is provided by the stock Android Beam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare functionality is now split into two: AllShare Play and AllShare Cast. The first is for transferring and sharing data and multimedia files to your notebook or PC. AllShare Cast on the other hand provides streaming content to and from different kind of devices (TV or computer) over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the mobile debut of the microUSB 3.0 port. It's basically the standard microUSB 2.0 port that's extended by additional pins to provide extra speed. You can hook a standard microUSB port on the left, but Samsung has included a special microUSB 3.0 cable that lets you take advantage of the extra oomph. You still get backwards compatibility and can use all your old cables, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port is also MHL-enabled, which lets it output output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. Sadly, there isn't one included in the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MHL port has yet another feature - it enables USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (there isn't one in the box) but this one is fairly straightforward - you plug it into the Galaxy Note and plug a standard USB cable on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just about every USB thumb drives and card reader we tried worked and reading all sorts of cards was problem-free - it even worked with a big CF card. Connecting phones worked pretty well too - we were able to access the memory of a Nokia 808 PureView we had laying around straight from the Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB keyboards and mice are also supported - a mouse cursor appears on the screen of the phablet and you can use it to do all sorts of stuff around the interface. We even managed to connect a printer, but we couldn't print a file straight from the Note II, as that only works with Samsung-made printers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an IR-port, which allows you to control various TV's and other devices using Samsung's WatchON app, which we'll cover below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser now supports gestures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the interface of the Android web browser hardly has changed, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has the hardware specs to propel it to great heights of user experience. The huge, ultra sharp display with great colors makes reading a joy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Galaxy Note 3's Air gestures support, you can flip between open tabs by simply swiping left and right across the screen, or scroll up and down by doing the same vertically. It takes a bit of getting used to, but is a neat feature once mastered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air view, Smart scroll and Smart stay all work in the browser, the first of which lets you simply hover your finger over a web element and it will act as if a mouse cursor was over it instead, which is great for websites not optimized for mobile devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for plug-ins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. The brightness and colors option gives you four different presets to adjust the display according to your preferences. Automatic brightness is an option, too, and works only within the browser.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 features a wide array of advanced features and applications that really make it stand apart from other flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the coolest apps is called Group Play. It shares various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room, but unlike DLNA it's interactive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One use case is to play a music track on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and use multiple phones as speakers. You can pick the role of each phone (e.g. left channel, right) all the way up to surround sound. This way you can control the music from one phone but use the loudspeakers of all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the other phones will need to support Group Play - the phones communicate over Wi-Fi (your Galaxy Note 3 becomes a hotspot that others connect to) and the pairing is done via NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More useful are the options to share a picture or a document - you can have the same picture appear on everyone's phone and you can draw over it if you need to highlight a certain element of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, perhaps the coolest feature of Group Play is that it allows for multiplayer games to be played on several phones simultaneously. Of course, only supported games work - there was a poker and puzzle games preloaded on our unit with Asphalt7 and Gun Bros offered as other games that support Group Play multiplayer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi Vision on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 allows you to stack up several devices and get a bigger resulting screen area for your content. If your friends rock a Galaxy Note 3 you can team up and create a cool video watching experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out how the feature works in our short video shot at IFA 2013.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Samsung Link, another way to share content between devices. Unlike Group Play, Samsung Link is intended for personal use. You can link the phone to a computer that is synced with Dropbox, SkyDrive or SugarSync and remotely access content on that device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator will help travelers - it can translate between two languages using either typed text or by using speech recognition. It can read out the resulting translation too, if you don't think your Korean accent can cut it. S Translator supports all the widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and, of course, Korean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung WatchON is the primary app used with the built-in IR emitter on the top of the phone. The app starts out by asking your zip code and pulls up a number of TV service providers in that area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is so that the app can show you a TV guide with shows currently on or upcoming on the channels offered by the service provider. You can read a description of the show, check out its popularity in up/down votes (and vote yourself, of course) and comments. You can also set reminders for shows you want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the key element of the app is the IR remote control functionality. The app can control TVs, DVD and Blu-ray players, streaming media players and air conditioners. Devices are organized by rooms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really liked about the app is that it knows some home setups are messy - some let you change channels with the TV remote, others require you to use the set-top box remote for that. Same for the audio, you might be using the TV to output the sound or an AV receiver. The app will ask about your setup and present a unified remote control interface even if you have multiple hardware remotes to control all the devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, S Health is Samsung's home-brewed health and fitness tracking application. It starts off by getting you to create a profile which includes all your vital statistics, such as age/weight/gender and level of activity, plus your calorie consumption goals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides a pleasant interface which gives you an at-a-glance look at your progress, as well as walking, exercise, and fitness trackers, plus you surrounding environmental influences, such as temperature. S Health also supports a number of optional accessories, which enables it to give even more detailed info on your status.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hubs get a makeover<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hubs are not just for Windows Phone - Samsung, at least, seems to think so. And while before there used to be several different applications for the various Samsung Hubs, in the latest TouchWiz they're all accessible from one centralized Samsung Hub location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing you can see right off the bat when accessing the Hub is absence of any social networking features. Samsung has dropped Social Hub features found in TouchWiz versions of old, leaving you to traditional dedicated apps for your social networking fix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the new Samsung Hub gives you access to stores for books, games, and educational material in a markedly Windows Phone-esque style. The Music Hub lets you browse music online (with search tools, charts, lists of new releases and so on). You can preview songs (30 seconds each) and buy tracks or whole albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of the sections take you to the respective stores. You can either buy digital magazines, books and online newspapers from the Book Store, browse and play either Social or Premium games in the Game Store. The latter features a try-before-you-buy option, as well as titles by Gameloft and EA, which are otherwise not available on the Google Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Office Editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike previous Galaxy flagships, the Galaxy Note 3 gives you only the Polaris Office viewer functionality, rather than the full-fledged editor. The viewer does not show up in your app drawer, but instead only opens when you select the relevant document from the My Files app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, you can view most document types, including PowerPoint, Word, Excel as well as PDF. We suspect Samsung will make sure a full-fledged editor is available for download from the Samsung Apps by the time the smartphone goes on sale, but even if it doesn't there's plenty of alternatives in the Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is as robust as ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Planner fills the role of your calendar app, and can be viewed by Day, Week, Month or Year, or by a list of all your upcoming tasks or events. The small squares for each date give only limited info on the events for the day, but thanks to Air View you can point to a day to read the full description of events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. There's also a World clock, stopwatch, and timer. They are easy to work with and can come in handy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps Navigation gives you the most out of GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in couple of minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. The barometer, however, can speed up GPS locks even without a data connection. We gotta say, we didn't experience any issues with the GPS performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (or larger) than most dedicated SatNav units, with excellent sunlight legibility and plenty of storage, money spent towards satellite navigation should go to buying a good app rather than a separate SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play is where the Android apps are<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps. From music / video players, to file managers and various tools, you'll always see something worth a try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has naturally included its own Apps store. It features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far lower number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has done it again - and it made it look so easy. The Galaxy Note 3 can pretend it has no competition, while otherwise remarkable rivals know they'll will have to live with - but not quite live up to - comparisons to the gadget that defines an entire segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Three generations into it, Samsung is returning to a playground which now has to be shared with others. There are bigger screens out there, waterproof bodies, impressive cameras and immensely powerful chipsets. But the Galaxy Note 3 is in no mood to share the spotlight, and is keen to show everyone that it doesn't break the rules - but makes them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 didn't need a massive screen to make its point. What Samsung did instead looks like a smart move. The new leather-look finish is great but that's not the only advantage in terms of design. The new Note is the size of the Note II, but thinner, lighter and with a bigger higher-res screen and even ampler battery. It's also powered by two of the best chipsets available and comes with the whopping 3GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung it well aware though that specs can be matched and eventually beaten. It's the experience that counts, and the Galaxy Note 3 is bursting at the seams with all the premium features of the Galaxy line of smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we don't just mean the various Air Gestures and things like Smart Stay and Smart Scroll, which are actually part of the standard equipment, so to speak. It's the S Pen features, the optimizations for single-hand use and the multi-tasking capabilities, which after the multi-window update are unrivaled that take the Galaxy Note 3 to the next level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being able to comfortably move content across applications and the new search feature are only beginning to tell the story. The S Pen is made to count almost everywhere in the interface. The dedicated single-hand mode isn't limited to just a smaller keyboard and dialer that you can move around and place within comfortable reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any screen, and we do mean any - from the homescreen to the deepest setting - can be resized for single-hand use, and when you do that the main controls (Home, Back and menu) are moved over to the dock at the bottom of the screen, and so are the volume controls - so you don't have to stretch your hand to reach the hardware volume keys on the phablet's side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Honestly though, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 doesn't have to worry so much about size not permitting single-handed use. To take full advantage of the Galaxy Note 3 you really need to have the device in one hand, stylus in the other. That said, we do think most of the likely rivals will have a hard time besting the Note 3's handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony recently unleashed the Snapdragon 800-powered Xperia Z Ultra. It has a massive 6.44-inch 1080p display responding to pen and pencil input. The phablet is water and dust resistant, on top of having one of the hottest bodies in business. The Xperia Z Ultra is seriously bigger than the Galaxy Note 3, though, and while the screen size may be a legitimate advantage, the LCD quality isn't quite a match for the Note's AMOLED. Still, the Z Ultra is around ?100 cheaper and can go under water so it might manage to build a loyal following.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z Ultra</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's first attempt at phablets, the 5.5" Optimus G Pro, is obviously too old to seriously trouble the Galaxy Note 3. The gadget runs on a Snapdragon 600 chipset and has a 13MP camera. It is considerably cheaper than the Galaxy Note 3 at around ?480, but omits the stylus input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus G Pro E985</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2, even though sporting a 5.2" only 1080p display, is much closer to the Galaxy Note 3 in terms of functionality and speed. The latest LG flagship is powered by the Snapdragon 800 chipset, offers a host of multi-tasking features and a respectable Q-Note repertoire. If the smaller screen is not a problem, it's definitely worth checking out. Currently the 16GB model costs ?200 less than the Note 3 but, considering the lack of memory expansion, the 32GB version might make more sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently-announced Liquid S2 is also a very interesting alternative. Acer will probably struggle to match Samsung and Sony's level of brand recognition, and like the rest of the competition, the S2 lacks a stylus. With a 6" 1080p IPS LCD, it's powered by the same Snapdragon 800 chipset and is capable of shooting 4K UHD videos, making it the Galaxy Note 3's only equal for the time being. In fact the Liquid S2 also adds a ring-flash for much better performance under low-light and will run you ?100 less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer Liquid S2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the phablet benchmark for the competition to live up to - and a matching price tag is perhaps the only piece of bad news. On the other hand, without the advantage of the S Pen, rivals haven't got too many options - they just deliver as much horsepower as possible and the push screen size as far as they can and hope for the best. The first obvious casualty is the comfort of handling. And the irony of it is that a device like the Note, which clearly is supposed to keep both hands busy, is more compact and more optimized for single-handed use than its main rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, Samsung and the Galaxy Note 3 have done it again and the bad news for the competition is that their phablets have just been relegated to just huge phones by the latest installment of the one that once started it all.</paragraph>
