			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace 3 arrives as Samsung's latest entry into the popular affordable Ace lineup, and targets cost conscious buyers with a competitive Android version and variants which include a vanilla 3G version and either dual SIM support or LTE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ace lineup was never a bottom-of-the-barrel affair, user have always enjoyed adequately-sized screens and powerful enough processors alongside timely software updates from Samsung to make it an excellent value offering long after the initial release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This was the exact strategy that Samsung successfully employed with the Samsung Galaxy Ace 2, which continues to be a very competitive Android package following its update to version 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. The Ace 2 continues to be a reasonable entry level droid more than a year and a half after its release, and even made it to our November 2013 shopping guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's see what the Ace 3 brings to the table, and whether it has the potential to continue the Ace legacy set forth by its predecessors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether the Galaxy Ace 3 can follow in the footsteps of its predecessor is a trick one to answer going by specs alone, seeing the incremental update in specs it represents - we have a bump in screen size and processor clock speed, and there's LTE connectivity if you get that specific version. We wish the Ace 3 came with the same price tag as the Ace 2, but that's not the case right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now, let's focus on what the Ace 3 brings along without comparisons to its forbearers. It provides a wide range of connectivity options, including the aforementioned LTE variant that brings quad-band 4G support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of design, the Ace 3 is very similar to the Ace 2, although Samsung has been able to trim the weight down slightly. Unfortunately, if you've had enough of Samsung's design language, the Galaxy Ace 3 will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth - it will only serve you with more of the same - there's hardly much novelty to go around here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start off our review with an in-depth hardware examination of the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3, covering everything from control layout to screen quality. Join us on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard retail package with a bonus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 comes in a very compact box, in line with Samsung's recent undertaking of using recycled paper and soy-ink print for the packaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ace 3 comes with a standalone A/C adapter that does not require the use the supplied microUSB cable for charging, as well as a pair of premium-looking headphones with molded earbuds. We would have liked all white accessories to go with our white colored Ace 3, but only the headset comes in a matching color.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 4-inch screen now, the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 measures 121.2 x 62.7 x 9.8 mm, which is slightly larger than the Ace 2 except in thickness, where Samsung has been able to trim off 0.7mm. With the thickness going south of 10mm the devices feels noticeably slimmer than the Ace 2. The LTE version of the Ace clocks in at exactly 10mm of thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weight-wise, the Ace 3 comes in slightly lighter than the Ace 2 by about 7 grams. The Ace 3's LTE version is slightly thicker and heavier, which leads to an even smaller difference compared to the Ace 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace 3 follows Samsung's rather overplayed design strategy. Other than a slight refresh given to the flagships, Samsung's design has remained the same when it comes to its more affordable range. It features a slick glossy paintjob that tends to attract its fair share of fingerprints. They're not too visible on our white paintjob, but we imagine they're a bit more obvious on the black and dark red-colored Ace 3's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's take a good look at the handset. Bellow the display you get the usual three keys: capacitive Menu and Back buttons either side of the hardware Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we have the earpiece as well as the usual proximity sensor. There's a VGA front-facing camera for video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 is where the volume rocker is located, while directly across on the right is the power/lock button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Ace 3 features the 3.5mm audio jack as well as a small slit for removing the back panel. At the bottom you'll find the microUSB port and microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the back, you'll see that the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 sports a 5MP camera capable of recording 720p video, and an LED flash. The loudspeaker grille is next to the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoing the back panel reveals the 1500mAh battery (1800mAh on the LTE version), alongside the dual SIM ports and the microSD card slot. Although only one microSIM port is blocked by the battery, neither is hot-swappable. The microSD card is, though you should unmount before removing it to avoid possible data corruption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery performance from the Ace 3 was about what you'd expect from this price range. Decent standby and talk times were brought down slightly by less than stellar video playback and web browsing performance, resulting in an overall endurance rating of 34 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 has a 4-inch screen of WVGA resolution (480 x 800 pixels). The screen is a bit larger than the 3.8-inch display on the Galaxy Ace 2, which results in a slightly worse pixel density (233 ppi), but makes operation so much easier since honestly, Android feels a bit cramped on anything less than a 4-inch WVGA screen. The larger screen allows for easier text input, for instance, as the keys of the virtual keyboard are not as small..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WVGA resolution does not get stretched significantly by the larger size either, and we'd say the slight sacrifice to pixel density is worth the extra screen estate. Otherwise, colors are good as is the brightness, and we didn't see much contrast shift in viewing angles either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the contrast is not the best we've seen, but is good for its class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is the same story - nothing spectacular, but still good for an entry level device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>

			<paragraph>We also put the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 screen under our microscope to show you its display matrix. It has the same inline RGB pixels as the Ace 2, although they're shaped differently and slightly tilted.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 is really easy to handle with its curved back fitting nicely in the palm of your hand. Given the friendlier, compact size, the slippery finish is a lot less of an issue than some of the larger flagship and phablet offerings from Samsung. Single-handed operation is a breeze as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our only complaint when it comes to the Ace 3 aesthetics is that the design language has been used by Samsung for almost two years now and it is already becoming a bit tiring and boring. Not to mention you would have a hard time distinguishing the Koreans' midrange smartphones apart just by looking at them. While this may be a certain advantage of driving sales (the affordable midrange phones look just like the company's much advertised flagship), the lack of product differentiating bears the danger of backfiring (making users look for an alternative smartphone that stands out elsewhere). Where's the fun in having your new phone look just the same as your old phone?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface with TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 runs on Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean skinned with Samsung's TouchWiz Nature UX. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the latest Galaxy flagships, but it's come a long way since the Gingerbread days of the Galaxy Ace 2 (which has since been updated to Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've shot a quick video showing off the user interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace 3 features the new lockscreen widgets introduced with Android 4.2. It can be customized to show the time along with a personal message, and beautiful images pulled from TripAdvisor providing the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in unskinned Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts right there on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen and the notification area are identical to what you get in the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five toggles at the top of the notification area to quickly enable and disable features. There are more than you can see, of course - simply swipe to reveal the rest. Or you can tap the button in the top right that displays a grid of all the shortcuts, 10 in total. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). A two finger swipe down on the notification banner directly opens the grid of toggles, and holding down on a toggle will directly take you to the relevant setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them, such as "Call back" or "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home" - that's the one you go back to when you press the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't really changed since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and some shortcuts can be hidden (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders. Widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a discreet but useful change to the way you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen - there's a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can judge how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung tweaked the Settings screen to use a tabbed interface. There are four tabs - Connection, My device, Accounts and More. You can find the relevant features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the My device tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest iteration of TouchWiz is highly customizable as usual, and offers rich functionality. As expected, most of the flagship features are missing in the Galaxy Ace 3 - but Air gestures are not a huge deal-breaker in our view, and Multi-window mode is not really feasible on such a small screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Out of the so-called Smart Screen package, you do get Smart Stay, which won't let the screen go blank as long as the front cam can detect you looking at it. Smart rotation is absent though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and is preloaded on the Galaxy Ace 3. S Voice can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, launch apps, play music, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it focuses on doing more on the actual phone in terms of available commands and it also has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy Ace 3 to answer a call, snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The problem with S Voice is that it is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and it can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version of Google Now (November 2013) will allow you to have short dialogues with the app AI when you are conducting searches. In these dialogues, Google Now should be able to understand when you referring to your search term by an indirect pronoun instead of using its full name. It will also answer back when there are several options for action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another perk of the new version is that you can now activate the Google Now voice commands handsfree by simply starting with a "Ok, Google" instead of pressing the Mic button. This however, should only work in US locales.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now now also taps into the crowd-sourced real-time traffic information by Waze - a popular smart navigation app project that Google purchased earlier this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget for the homescreen or lockscreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 is powered by a Broadcom BCM21664 chipset, which is the same as what's found on some other entry-level offerings like the Samsung Galaxy Fame. On the regular Galaxy Ace 3 and our dual-SIM model, the CPU is clocked at 1GHz, while on the LTE version it goes up to 1.2 GHz. The Galaxy Ace 2 also had a dual-core CPU but it was of the now-defunct NovaThor variety and it maxed out at 800MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Broadcom chips tend to excel at web applications while falling behind slightly in generally processing and graphics performance, so we were eager to see how much better it is than the Ace 2's dual-core 800 MHz NovaThor chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-threaded performance of the Ace 3 turned out just as expectedly towards the bottom of the pack due to the low clock speed. The Ace 3 does outperform some of the lesser Sony and Samsung offerings, however.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 3 tests out the CPU as well as memory performance. Here the Ace 3 did not stack up well against the competition, but you have got to remember it runs against mostly flagship-grade devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu and Quadrant are compound benchmarks, giving the CPU, GPU and memory a run. Here the Galaxy Ace 3 is able to gain back some lost ground, particularly in AnTuTu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The VideoCore IV GPU found on the Ace 3 is decidedly several steps behind most flagship graphics units, so we've decided to forego our usual GFXBench offscreen GPU benchmarks. Epic Citadel refused to run on the Ace 3, so we had to dig up some older Nenamark 2 benchmarks for comparison. Here the device scores better than most older smartphones in its class.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we move on to the web browsing benchmarks, which has been traditionally a strong point for Broadcom processors, particularly when it comes to HTML 5. The Ace 3 manages decent results, but nothing particularly impressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultimately, the Galaxy Ace 3 leaves something to be desired in almost all areas, but it is a budget device after all. Navigating the interface does have its fair share of slowdowns, particularly when the 1GB of RAM starts to fill up, but it's nothing as bad as some of the real bottom-of-the-barrel droids.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on the Galaxy Ace 3 packs a wide range of features. Four tabs on top provide access to the Phone app, Groups, Contacts and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can move contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A call or a message to someone can be initiated directly from the contact list with a right and left swipes respectively, which is really handy on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contacts feature, upon a tap on the contact picture, shows a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, video call, text or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all the details available. Information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. You can use the back button to go to the full contact list, or tap in the top left corner, just like in vanilla Android. The top right corner has shortcuts to contact editing and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the phone book finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt you to join them. Furthermore, there is a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like the previous version of TouchWiz, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reject list blocks certain numbers from calling you, even just prefixes (you can block international callers). It works great with preset numbers and you can also bar unknown numbers. There are third party blacklist apps in the Play Store but it's nice to have this out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a specific vibration pattern as an incoming call alert, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too. You can also assign a custom vibration to specific contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the Galaxy Ace 3 is really something. It's almost too advanced for some users but its interface is simple enough so you can only use the features you need. Once you get your bearings you will appreciate having cool extras like Direct Call and selective call barring, which stock and most other reincarnations of Android lack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM telephony and native video calling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have the dual-SIM variant of the Galaxy Ace 3, you'll get a special dual-SIM interface in the settings menu. This lets you rename your SIM cards for easy identification (the Ace 3 will remember settings for specific SIMs), as well as choose which card to use for establishing mobile data network connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification are also has a quick toggle with which you can switch your active SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 offers top notch in-call audio and managed to hold onto reception with ease. Earpiece volume is great and Samsung has even gone as far as adding an in-call equalizer, which does wonders if you want an even louder experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Native video calls are available as well, right in the phone app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace 3 has Smart Dial, which searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest of the matches (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Direct Call is available too and lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts or reading/composing a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is on hand and it's taken care of by the S Voice service, which activates on a double tap of the home button. Or you can alternatively say "Hi Galaxy" while you have the phone unlocked and directly speak your command afterwards (e.g. "call Dexter"). It takes a while to process voice commands but it has more uses than other third-party voice-recognition apps for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off when you hold it next to your ear during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another person to the conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3's loudspeaker scored a Below Average mark, which means that you'll have a hard time hearing in loud environments even at it loudest volume setting. You can find more about the testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great messaging capabilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: a list of all your messages organized into threads with a Compose message button in the top right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMSs and MMSs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a right swipe starts a call, while a left swipe starts a new message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard of the Galaxy Ace 3 doesn't have an additional numeric row above the letter keys because of the small screen size. The layout is pretty much the same as what we used to see in the third generation of Galaxies. Typing on it is much less error-prone than on the Galaxy Ace 2 with its smaller screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Swype-like mode, which tracks your finger and guesses the word you're trying to type. This feature works great but has limited language support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional input methods include a regular handwriting and Google's voice input, which can work even offline if you've downloaded the required language files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has left a lot of room for customizing your messaging experience. You can choose from different speech bubble patterns and background, and can use the volume keys to increase or decrease the font in conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're composing a new message you can use the Translate option to translate it into another language. The same goes for messages you've received. This feature probably won't see much use but it's there if you ever need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What will come in good use, however, is (again) the Direct call feature. When you are reading a message from someone, their number will be automatically dialed just by lifting the handset up to your face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the dialer, the Messaging app has built-in spam filter. You can block some numbers (or all unknown numbers) and even add specific phrases to be blocked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Gmail app now displays contact images in mails. If an email has multiple recipients, they're shown in a grid similar to the Hangouts app. If there is no contact image, it just shows the first letter of the sender against a color background. You can disable sender images in the email app if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail v4.5 also includes the four new inbox options. You can have your mail sorted by Primary, Social, Promotions and Updates as you can on the web version of Gmail, which makes it easy to keep track of your mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Email app can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts, the ex-GTalk client, handles the Instant Messaging department. The new app offers group video chats, emojis, photo exchange, history sync across multiple devices, and a completely new UI design. It's available on iOS as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Feature-rich gallery but no air view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Ace 3 is quite similar to what you get on the regular S4 except for the air view option. It can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. There is no spiral view here. You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing an album's contents, a right swipe will reveal a bar with the rest of the albums available. In this mode you can browse images in a split-screen mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a press and hold on an image, the gallery gives you the option to select multiple items, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos on the Galaxy Ace 3 is a pleasant experience. The screen is ample and treats you to very pleasant colors. The gallery naturally supports full-res images. You can enable the Adobe RGB screen mode for more accurate color rendering if this is important to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, with a line of small thumbnails below displaying all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily edit photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also write a note over the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery supports highly customizable slideshows too, with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy Ace 3 is the same as the one on the Galaxy S4. It is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including .FLAC, .WAV, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album, Playlist, etc. but there's also Folder support (which is more often found on third party players) - it's quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on so many other players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music square is quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and lets you build playlists based on mood rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 can also search for content on third party players like PCs on the same network via the DLNA functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one with 7 bands) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options: a timeline, play/pause and skip controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, an AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent video player, but no fullHD, DivX or AC3 codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 has the last watched video on top for quick access. There are two tabs below it - personal (showing you the videos on your local storage) and Nearby devices, which shows the PCs and players on your local Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans all subtitles, so the file doesn't even have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big disappointment here is the relatively poor video codec support. It plays XviD, MP4 and MKV files of up to 720p resolution, but fullHD and DivX is not supported, and neither are the AC3 audio codecs or DTS sound. Of course, you can download a third-party video player off the Play Store to play those, but it's always nice when you have built-in support for them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS, broadcast recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace 3 comes equipped with an FM Radio with RDS. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 12 stations as favorites. You can also play on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it acts as the antenna. You can record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The same old 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 comes with a 5MP primary camera and a 0.3MP front-facer, just like the Galaxy Ace 2. While it's hard to expect much from a budget range device like the Ace 3, from a hardware standpoint you're not getting anything better than the Galaxy Ace 2 in this department, and that's a device more than a year and a half old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder handles both still and video capture, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution - if you're shooting full resolution 5MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings are found in two places. The first is the Mode button under the shutter key. It brings up a carousel with different shooting modes, each with a descriptive image and text. When you get familiar with those modes, you can switch to the grid, which drops the text but is faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper left corner, there are a couple of quick settings plus an arrow to reveal more options. The arrow at the bottom of the screen brings up a row of color effects. Each effect gets a live preview, so you can see what the particular scene will look like with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are more settings in the top left corner, but they won't be very often used. Still, there a number of interesting options here like having the volume rocker act as a still shutter key, a video shutter key or a zoom lever. Another interesting option is contextual file names - the Galaxy Ace 3 will name photos with your location (the GPS needs to be on for this to work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go over the different modes. There are standard modes like Panorama, Night, and Sports. Panoramas are nice, they do a full 360° circle, but the resolution is not that impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound &amp; shot captures a photo and records ambient sound. It sounds pretty cool - for example, you can hear the sea gulls in a beach photo or the roar of car engines at a race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos tend to have a high contrast setting and thus usually result in overblown highlights in bright areas. In areas of mixed lighting, it becomes evident that the dynamic range isn't that great either. The colors are accurate as is the exposure, but there are clear signs of an overly-aggressive oversharpening filter that brings in a lot of noise.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p video capture lacks fine detail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 stores videos in MP4 files with a bitrate of 12Mbps on average. Audio is recorded in mono at 62Kbps and a sampling rate of 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available before and during video recording and you can switch back to continuous autofocus if you prefer. You can capture 720p still images during recording, and the samples come out with the same quality as the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured with the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 very poor resolved detail, even for a non 1080p camera. There's the same issue with high contrast which results in a white-ish haze over the images, which also detracts from the level of detail. Colors are otherwise good and the framerate is a solid 30fps. We would have liked stereo audio, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is also an untouched video sample from the Galaxy Ace 3 that you can download directly - 720p @ 30fps(0:08s, 12.2MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basic connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of connectivity, the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 starts off with the basics - quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G. An LTE-variant of the device is also available, with coverage for LTE 800 / 900 / 1800 / 2600 bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ace 3 uses Bluetooth 4.0 alongside Wi-Fi support which includes b/g/n with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE-enabled Galaxy Ace 3 allows you to share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the S4 and other later-generation S devices back-to-back. You can share with other NFC devices as well, but functionality is limited to what is provided by the stock Android Beam.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android browser with Google Chrome also on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 comes with two excellent web browsers - the stock Jelly Bean edition and Google Chrome. The stock browser UI is quite minimalistic - you get the URL bar with shortcuts to tabs and settings, and that's that. Hitting the Settings key reveals the rest of the controls - everything from searching on the page, saving to bookmarks to useful options like bypassing mobile sites, saving a page for offline reading and sharing a page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for plug-ins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which lets you surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. The brightness and colors option gives you four different presets to adjust the display according to your preferences. Automatic brightness is an option too, and works only within the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no Lab settings and you can't enable the Quick Controls we've seen on other droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer, you can use the other preinstalled browser, Chrome, instead. It offers excellent cross-platform sync capabilities, and at times it performs even faster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While it doesn't have all of the extra apps Samsung throws into their flagships, the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 does have a few nifty applications that help it stand out from other smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator will help travelers - it can translate between two languages using either typed text or speech recognition. It can read out the resulting translation too, if you don't think your, say Korean accent can cut it. S Translator supports many widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and, of course, Korean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Galaxy Ace 3 comes preloaded with a special "Samsung edition" of the TripAdvisor app. Besides the ability to supply a fresh supply of lockscreen background images, the Samsung-specific version of the app allows you to login with your Samsung account, use the S Travel widget for a quick peek at certain popular travel destinations, as well as automatically add relevant travel information to your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the app lets you find interesting things to do if you're in a new city, as well as hotels, restaurants and even flight information. Most locations have reviews posted by other TripAdvisor users, so you can quickly see if a place is worth it or not.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Office Viewer pre-installed, sans editing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace 3 gives you only the Polaris Office viewer functionality, instead of the full-fledged editor. The viewer does not show up in your app drawer, but instead only opens when you select the relevant document from the My Files app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, you can view most document types, including PowerPoint, Word, Excel as well as PDF. It can present the document as is or reflow the text to fit on the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Planner fills the role of your calendar app, and can be viewed by Day, Week, Month or Year, or by a list of all your upcoming tasks or events. The small squares for each date give only limited info on the events for the day, but thanks to Air View you can point to a day to read the full description of events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. There's also a World clock, stopwatch, and timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ace 3 features the standard Memo app, which only allows for text input. There's no handwriting support like in the S Memo app found on the more premium Galaxy S and Note range of devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files is Samsung's universal file manager that comes pre-installed on every Galaxy we've met so far. It offers all you need in a file explorer: multiple selection, cut, copy, paste, create folders, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a voice recorder that lets you record and store voice memos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps Navigation gives you the most out of GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about three minutes with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace 3 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Google has recently upgraded the Maps app (v7.0) with new user interface, but its functionality is the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play, Samsung Apps and Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Apps features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far lower number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers available only to its customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a store too for books and games through Samsung Hub. The Book store allows a preview of the first few pages of a book. You can read book reviews and synopses, author bios and search for more books by the same author.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking at the Ace 3 merely from a specifications standpoint, it's hard to see it as a very worthy upgrade over the already excellent Galaxy Ace 2. After all, for a device that follows its predecessor by more than a year, you'd expect more than merely an extra 200 MHz under the hood, 0.2 inches added to the screen, and 256MB more RAM. But hey, we guess those specs Samsung deemed worthy for the Ace lineup in 2013.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That being said, the Jelly Bean update to the Galaxy Ace 2 doesn't result in the greatest of user experiences - it's certainly not as smooth as many of the other Project Butter devices, though you get all the new features and services alright. So a more capable hardware was called for to continue the bloodline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace 3 runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean with surprisingly rare lags for a run of the mill dual core 1GHz processor, and it is a lot quicker than the Ace 2 running Android 4.1.2, so it seems like the marginal hardware gains do make a rather big difference and the Ace 3 is more than the sum of its parts. Still, there's always the question of price, and there the Ace 2 does have a significant advantage. In other words, the Galaxy Ace 3 is just too expensive where it stands right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 I8160</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That being said, there are plenty of other fish in the Entry-level Sea, and the Ace series certainly aren't the only Samsung entries in that category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core and Galaxy S II Plus provide many of the same specs that you'll find on the Ace 3 at a price that's roughly the same. Both feature larger displays of the same WVGA resolution and dual-core 1.2GHz processors, with the Core's being of the faster Snapdragon S4 variety. The S II Plus has the upper hand with its AMOLED screen and its 8MP camera with 1080p video recording, while the Core even has a dual-SIM variant if that's what you are after. Both of these cost about the same as the Ace 3 right now, which is a shame (and it's not these two that should be ashamed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9105 Galaxy S II Plus ? Samsung Galaxy Core I8260</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also has a number of midrangers that have sufficiently fallen in price to compete with the Ace 3. One of these is the Galaxy S III mini. It features a 4-inch Super AMOLED display, that should result in longer battery life and has superior fidelity to the screen found on the Ace 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony and HTC also have capable competitors in the form of the HTC Desire 500 and Sony Xperia L. Both have 4.3-inch displays and superior 8MP cameras (an HDR mode on the Xperia even), while the Desire 500 even includes a quad-core processor (though entry level) and has a dual-SIM variant, if, again, that's what you are after.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Desire 500 ? Sony Xperia L</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Windows Phone-powered Nokia Lumia 625 offers a 4.7-inch display covered in Gorilla Glass 2, as well as a dual-core 1.2 Krait CPU with Adreno 305 GPU. There's also a hefty 2000 mAh battery and the 5MP camera is capable of fullHD video recording, but most importantly, the Lumia 625 also has triple-band LTE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 625</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While all of the above are capable alternatives to the Ace 3, it's important to note that only the Nokia Lumia 625 is able to provide LTE connectivity, and even then not on as many bands. If connecting to a 4G network is critical in your area, the value of the Galaxy Ace 3 is immensely greater than almost every other alternative that we mentioned so far. Simply put, you cannot find an LTE-enabled Android phone at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, taking out the LTE model (which has an even faster 1.2GHz processor, a larger battery, and NFC connectivity over the non-LTE models), we'd be hard pressed to recommend the Galaxy Ace 3 at anything above the ?150 price point. It's 'emerging LTE markets or bust' for this entry level droid.</paragraph>
