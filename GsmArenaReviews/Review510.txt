			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no way you have missed the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3. It's been the bang-for-buck benchmark for a while now, delivering a feature set and performance way above what its price tag suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To refresh your memory Xiaomi launched the Redmi Note 3 at the turn of last year and it was powered by a MediaTek Helio X10. In the spring of 2016, a Qualcomm-driven Redmi Note 3 followed and broke the company's sales record in India. Now this full review admittedly comes a little late, but the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is still on many people's radar, so we figured a way to compare the Mediatek-powered original and the Snapdragon edition might come in handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the chipset, there's also a new camera sensor, a 16MP unit even if it is limited to 1080p video recording. Another difference is the second SIM card tray can now take microSD cards. It's the hybrid kind, which isn't ideal for people who want to have it all. Other than that, the hardware is perfectly familiar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like sealed batteries, the shared card slot is the compromise we're only going to see more often, like it or not. Anyway, even this less-than-perfect solution makes an already popular and capable phone better than before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The near perfect balance of price and specs should be no news but let's check out the rest of the Redmi Note 3 with the dragon fire at medium heat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Special thanks to HonorBuy.com for providing the review unit.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 comes in plain box that holds a 2A charging adapter, a microUSB cable and some user guides. Traditionally for Xiaomi, there are no headphones included.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon version of the Redmi Note 3 has exactly the same size and design as the MediaTek-powered original. Xiaomi didn't have to change the phone's thickness to fit the new 16MP sensor and the phone measures the identical 150 x 75 x 8.7mm. The weight is the same as well at 164g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Redmi Note 3's exterior for the Snapdragon version repeats the original. The design can even be traced back to the Redmi Note 2, except that plastic has been replaced by aluminum. The fit and finish is quite good and the phone feels durable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A metal-clad unibody is a cool thing to have on a mid-range handset and we are certainly happy Xiaomi chose it for the Redmi Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the front is covered by an entire piece of black glass. The signature red accent on the capacitive keys is gone and instead Xiaomi made them invisible blending into the black glass until they come alive with white backlighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint sensor is placed just below the main camera at the rear, where your index finger falls naturally. It's the always-on kind and will unlock the screen upon a touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two plastic strips at the back top and bottom make sure the phone's antennas work, but on a positive note Xiaomi made them very well, covered with the same silver paint as the rest of the body, so you can barely spot them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal finish of the Redmi Note 3 allows good enough handling, but not as great as on the matte Redmi Note 2. Opting for metal instead of matte plastic may have made the phone more slippery, but it boosted its looks by a mile, so we'd call it a smart compromise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Little about the control set has changed since the Redmi Note 2. Above the screen is the earpiece flanked by a couple of sensors and the selfie camera. Below the 5.5" display is the capacitive Android trio, and you can assign those keys additional quick actions at double tap and tap-and-hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left of the Redmi Note 3 accommodates the ejectable SIM tray. You can either use two microSIM cards or opt for a microSD card - it takes the second SIM card slot. The volume rocker and power/lock key are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi Note 3 has the audio jack, the IR blaster, and the secondary microphone on top. The microUSB port and the primary mic are over at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, around the metal cover, the dual-LED flash sits next to the new 16MP snapper and the fingerprint scanner. The loudspeaker grille is also around, close to the bottom antenna strip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 features a 5.5" Full HD IPS, the same as on the Redmi Note 2, which has 401ppi for pleasantly sharp imagery. Unfortunately, there is no information on the glass covering the display and there is a good chance it isn't of the scratch-resistant kind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a closer look at it under our digital microscope reveals a standard RGB arrangement of the sub-pixels that make up the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 LCD panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 seems to be identical with the one on the Redmi Note 2. It has about the same maximum brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen's contrast ratio is average at 953:1. The color rendering accuracy is passable as well with an average deviation of DeltaE 6.8 and max deviation DeltaE 13. We managed to improve the color rendering by shifting the screen setting to a warmer preset (there is an option for changing the color temperature) and by doing so we got a more accurate color rendering with an Avg DeltaE of 5.2 and a Max DeltaE of 9.1. However at this setting the screen takes a 10% hit in the maximum brightness output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is just average. The screen glass is rather reflective and while you will be able to see what's happening on the screen under bright sunlight, you'll need the maximum brightness and all the colors will be washed out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Redmi Note 3 has a 4,000mAh battery. The battery is non-removable, but we don't think that's going to be a major issue with this phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our extensive battery test, the Redmi Note 3 managed an excellent single-SIM endurance rating of 93 hours and just 2 hours less when you have the two SIM slots filled. The Snapdragon version managed to keep going for nearly 3 hours more when doing web browsing and video playback compared to the MediaTek one, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a battery saver mode of sorts that's on by default, which cuts back the location and network access of background apps, but we didn't notice any adverse effects, such as apps not updating in the background, etc., so we decided to leave it on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A different chipset implies different connectivity features and the Redmi Note 3 equipped with the Snapdragon 650 is compatible with more LTE bands compared to the MediaTek-powered original. You can tap to an LTE network on either SIM, but once you do, the second one will be limited to GSM connectivity only. As for that, the Redmi Note 3 offers tri-band GSM connectivity and quad-band 3G connectivity with HSPA support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microUSB 2.0 port handles charging and wired data transfers. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory over a USB connection. The microUSB port also supports USB On-the-go for connecting USB peripherals such as pen drives, keyboards or real USB hard drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wireless screen mirroring is available via the Miracast protocol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IR blaster is located on the top and coupled with the right software, it can be used to operate pretty much any remotely controlled home appliance, turning the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 into a universal remote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi provides its own MiRemote app right out of the box.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Snapdragon-rocking Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 unit runs on a Global MIUI 8 beta, which is built on top of an Android 5.1.1 Lollipop core. The MIUI 8 brings its own take at the interface and improves on its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to Xiaomi's changelog, MIUI 8 comes with better text rendering, enhanced Power saving mode, new Notes app and Enhanced video editing tools.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual Xiaomi's customizations run very deep and replace everything including all Google services. In fact, the Mi phones sold in China don't have access to Google's services and those need to be sideloaded one way or the other (some resellers may even do that for you). The models sold officially on markets outside of China come with a preloaded Play Store app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is unchanged from MIUI7 and has a clock in the top left corner - gone are the lockscreen widgets. To unlock the phone you swipe upwards and if you want a quick access to the camera - just swipe from the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fingerprint unlock is available and is handled in our favorite way - you just put your finger on the sensor at the back and the Redmi Note 3 unlocks immediately. The scanner is always on and you can unlock even when the screen is asleep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is the Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts docked at the bottom by default, but you can dock up to five items. You can have any app there or even folders with multiple items if you will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no app drawer - anything you install pops up on your homescreen, which can have unlimited panes. There're no shortcuts and the usual routine of removing icons (dragging them up to a recycle bin at the top of the screen) will uninstall the corresponding app. There is a pop-up for confirming the action though, so you can't accidentally uninstall apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreen widgets are available, too - tap and hold on the homescreen, then choose Widgets. There are few options available, but of course, you can get even more from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreen effects are available and you can change themes, too. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system icons, system font and the sound profile (you can disable changing the sound profile from settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI v.8 has five default themes - MIUI, High Life, Pink Blush, Rose and Ocean Breeze. They've been handpicked by the MIUI team and you can choose your interface look right from the start, but you can always download new themes from the Mi Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two semi-transparent tabs - the first one hosts all notifications, while the second one (swipe left to access) offers customizable quick toggles and a Settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An enhanced task switcher with Clear All option is available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi provides its own cloud service for content syncing between devices. Each Mi Cloud account is granted 5GB of free storage. You can use it to backup contacts, messages, your entire gallery, calls log, notes, settings, voice recordings, Browser content (history, tabs, webapp data) and your music library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode has been enhanced too - it supports better customization and scheduling options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did get our review unit with pre-installed Google Play Store plus Google sync for app data, contacts, and browser data but perhaps they've been sideloaded by the reseller providing this review unit. Of course, you can sideload them yourself one way or the other if they don't come pre-installed on your unit. And once you have those, you can easily download all other Google apps such as Google Now straight from the Play Store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We come to the key change in the upgraded Redmi Note 3 - its Snapdragon 650 chipset. It houses a hexa-core CPU comprised of quad 1.4GHz Cortex-A53 cores and dual 1.8GHz Cortex-A72 ones. Handling the graphics load is an Adreno 510 GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on the model you choose - either 16GB or 32GB - the amount of RAM changes from 2GB to 3GB, respectively. For the review we are using the 32GB/3GB RAM model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first Redmi Note 3 came with the Helio X10 chipset, which only has Cortex-A53 cores, but at higher clock speed. The Snapdragon 650 will have obvious single-core advantage thanks to its two Cortex-A72 cores, which are noticeably faster, but it has two cores fewer overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With that out of the way, let's see the result from the actual benchmarks. Starting with GeekBench 3, where in its multi-core component, the Helio X10 Redmi Note 3 has an advantage over the Snapdragon 650 one. After all eight cores are more than six.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things quickly change in the single-core part of the test where the Cortex-A72 make easy work of the Cortex-A53 ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In AnTuTu 6, the Redmi Note 3 (S650) comes close to Sony Xperia X, which uses the same Snapdragon 650. Interestingly, the Redmi Note 3 proves better than the Samsung Galaxy A9 (2016)which has the higher-standing Snapdragon 652 chip. Keep in mind that this is a compound benchmark, so all of the system's resources are at play here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time to stress out the GPU starting with BaseMark X. The Adreno 510 offers decent, if unspectacular performance and will be able to run most modern, GPU intensive games.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Changing the engine of the Redmi Note 3 with a Snapdragon 650 chipset boosted the phone's performance significantly over the previous iteration. The Snapdragon-boasting Redmi Note 3 is not only snappier, but its day-to-day use is a lot smoother, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: Our review unit was running the 6.8.11 Beta build of MIUI 8. All observations made are based upon this build and some things could change with the stable build on the retail units.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contacts and telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the phonebook share a single app although there are two shortcuts, bringing you straight to the tab you need. The app has pleasant flat looks and it's about the same as we remember it. It uses a tabbed interface - recent with dialer on the first and the contact list on the second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 supports voice call recording and it can do it automatically on each call if you like. You can also assign an answer gesture, pre-define quick responses upon reject, there is even support for internet calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are even more call settings if you dig deeper into the menu - flip to mute the ringer, turn on/off the proximity sensor, lock automatically once slipped in a pocket, it can even mute calls from unknown numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 seems to feature the same speaker as the Note 2. It scored a Good mark on our loudness test, and outed pretty much the same results on all three tests as the Note 2. Produced sound is rather pleasant and deep enough. This means missed calls are unlikely in most environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 comes with a custom Gallery app, slightly updated since the MIUI 6. It defaults to your camera roll, but it also supports Albums, Cloud and People. The People sorting, once chosen, sorts all of your photos by people's faces. Everything is automatic. Here you can also create a new baby album, to put your newborn pics inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated editor offers various effects, frames, tools (crop, mirror, straighten, rotate, fisheye, doodle) plus light adjustments that let you bring out the shadows or the highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MIUI music player is a custom app with a well laid out, easy to navigate interface. The player has cool effects, transitions and transparent elements, especially on the expandable Now Playing section. It can also display lyrics, but the files you throw in have to be properly filled out with information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An FM radio app is also available. The Redmi Note 3 does not require a headset to use as an antenna, so you can listen FM radio without any additional accessories. FM recording is also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 features a separate video app, which offers a paid video service. Whether you will open your files from the Video app (Local setting) or File Explorer - it doesn't really matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface is very basic but there is rich video codec support. It managed to play everything we threw at it (including MKV and WMV files). The AC3 audio codec is surprisingly, supported too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles and pop-up play are not supported by the MIUI's video player though, so you might want to look around the Play Store if you need a more capable alternative.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is mostly good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 started off great in our audio quality test. When connected to an active external amplifier, the smartphone showed high volume levels and perfectly clean output for one of the best showings out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we plugged in a pair of headphones the stereo crosstalk rose only a moderate amount - unlike the Redmi Note 2, which saw a lot of damage in that case. Volume still dropped though and we got some intermodulation distortion and frequency response deviations. The overall results are still good and a notable step forward for the Xiaomi Redmi Note line, but not quite up there with the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Upgraded camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Redmi Note 3 boasts a refreshed 16 megapixel camera on the back with phase detection autofocus, f2.0 aperture and a two-tone dual LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is fairly simple and features toggles for the HDR mode, the flash and the video camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has three panes - the default one shows the viewfinder with a virtual shutter, flash trigger and front camera key. A pull down from the top of the screen gets you a choice of 12 filters with live previews. A slide from the bottom displays the advanced modes such as Panorama, Beautify, Timer, Scenes, and Manual as well as the camera settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manual Mode offers you manual settings for white balance and ISO. The Face Detection switch is within the additional settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're quite pleased with the camera performance of the Redmi Note 3 Snapdragon edition. The camera resolves a lot of detail with very little noise to be seen. The white balance is good too, although colors are a bit too dull.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera focused quickly and accurately and very few of the shots we took turned out blurry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn the HDR mode on and the photos come to live. Not only are the mids and highlights cranked up, but the colors become more saturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama shots are available too. You can capture both landscape and portrait panoramic photos with a 180 degree field of view. Shooting is easy but the stitching takes a while to complete. The end result is rather disappointing though - the resolution is about 1720x808px and the image quality is quite poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 features a 5MP front-facing camera for high-res selfies. The images come out soft with average detail, but will do for Facebook or similar social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can take a look at how the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (S65) stacks up against similarly equipped smartphones in our Photo Compare Tool.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 camcorder has the same UI as the still camera. It supports slow-mo (the result is a 720p@16fps video) and time-lapse videos with customizable snapping interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is capable or recording up to 1080p@30fps. The bitrate of the video recordings is uninspiring at about 15 Mbps, while audio is captured at 128 Kbps with 2 channels (stereo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved detail in the videos is average. The colors and contrast are better than the still photos and the framerate is smooth and consistent at 30fps. The dynamic range is about average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a 1080p video we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the 1080p video sample (8s, 14.6MB) taken straight off the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Snapdragon).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 enters our video comparison tool. There are plenty of 1080p camcorders you can compare it against.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check out our Video Compare Tool to see how the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (S650) fares against the competition when it comes to video capturing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>MIUI Browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 comes with the feature-rich MIUI Browser. It has flat looking UI elements and does a great job at browsing. There is a native ad-block add-on and a data saver, it supports downloads, there is a night mode as well. It is as almost as fast as Chrome, and now supports Find on Page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also offers a built-in Reading mode, which isn't available in Chrome. It enlarges the text font and strips away unneeded elements, leaving only the article you are reading in focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aforementioned Night Mode, which is something we really miss in Chrome. It inverts the background and font colors and is easier on the eyes at dark rooms. Not that the Redmi Note 3 really needs it as its minimum brightness level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the browser supports some very handy features as scrolling with the volume keys, quick tab switching from the edge of the display, you can opt for different search engines, among others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 offers a great file managing app called Explorer, which lets you browse the files in its internal storage and groups them by type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MIUI v8 also offers a Security app. It can scan your phone for malware, manage your blocklist, manage or restrict your data usage, configure battery behavior, clean some RAM, it can also manage the permissions of your installed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom and now flat Calendar looks good, syncs with your accounts including Google, and offers Day and Month views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the standard sound recorder, notes, flashlight, calculator, clock, and weather apps, among others, that are a given in any self-respecting Android package nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really liked the Compass app. It has very nice and clean interface, shows the magnetic directions and doubles as level meter. If you lift the phone up then you'll get a nice augmented reality view with real-time East/West/North/South overlay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, if Google Maps, Drive, or any other Google-related app isn't installed on your unit, you can get it for free from the Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Build quality is top-notch, the metal body is neat and sturdy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is decent: it isn't among the brightest we've seen, but offers deep blacks, good viewing angles and contrast. The sunlight legibility however is only average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life impressive with an endurance rating of 93h.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rich wireless and wired connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI 8 is a clean and light Android Lollipop launcher but with rich customization options; we would've liked to see a more recent version of Android, though</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 650 is very fast for the mid-range</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player supports every common video codec and AC3 sound but has no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio quality is excellent with an external amplifier, but average with headphones plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera photos are good, with average good detail and dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p video samples are decent</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, the value to be had in the Redmi Note series is indisputable. A handful already of affordable midrangers have helped Xiaomi grow a loyal following in Asia but also raise brand awareness in old, established markets traditionally dominated by big-name brands.</paragraph>
