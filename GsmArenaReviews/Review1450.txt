			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Occasionally HTC takes a little break from high-end smartphones and dips its toes in the waters of the lower midrange. The HTC Wildfire is a down-sized, down-clocked and down-priced version of the HTC Desire. If Sony Ericsson can do it with the X10 mini, then HTC have all the right in the world to make a Desire mini too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But while the Desire was something that easily snatched everybody?s attention, the Wildfire is a bit more toned down despite its fire-some name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wildfire is certainly the right phone for those who like to always stay in touch. The high-end connectivity is all there, along with solid social network integration and browsing. It seems the display and CPU are the only downgrades from the Desire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that?s still a lot. Android phones with QVGA screens have failed to impress and the size of the Wildfire?s display gives no reason to be optimistic here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the Wildfire boasts the premium finish of the Nexus One and the HTC Desire. Not only is a touch of style always welcome in the lower tiers of the market but users will probably appreciate the compact size too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, repackaging a flagship device to sell to a wider range of customers is easier said than done, so let?s see what the Wildfire has to offer. By the way, choosing a name that?s so much catchier is a good way to start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re back after the break with a spin and a closer look at the HTC Wildfire exterior.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package: good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering the lower price range, the HTC Wildfire?s package is fairly complete. It has the essentials and a couple of small perks: a 2GB microSD and a one-piece headset with music controls. The headset uses the a standard 3.5 mm audio jack so you can use your own instead, but you will have to live without the remote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB cable plugs into the charger so you will need both to charge your HTC Wildfire the old fashioned way. USB charging is enabled too. A bunch of manuals complete the list of items in the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Wildfire 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keeping it compact was high on the Wildfire designers? priority list. At 106.8 x 60.4 x 12 mm the device can easily slip in any pocket ? let alone a purse. The phone certainly hopes to appeal to both male and female customers, and has the color range to do it. The Wildfire will be available in white, black, brown and red.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while some may frown at the relatively heavy weight of 118 grams, we actually think it?s a benefit. The nice solid feel we?ve come to expect from high-end phones brings the Wildfire another step closer to the HTC Desire.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, the Wildfire is a pretty close replica of the Desire (and the Nexus One). It doesn?t have the kind of looks to make your heart skip a beat, but it?s a subtly stylish and solidly built phone ? and that?s nothing to be ashamed of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ok, it?s a phone that will grow up wearing its older brother?s old clothes. But we don?t have to worry about its self esteem. The designers were after decent functionality in an attractive looking package and we think they?ve done a pretty good job. The only thing to be concerned with is the screen. WVGA AMOLED was a treat in the Desire, but sadly the Wildfire is nowhere near that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 3.2? and QVGA resolution, the HTC Wildfire touchscreen offers the lowest pixel density we have seen lately and that?s a real disadvantage for the picture quality. 125 ppi is pretty good for a computer screen but you look at it from a much greater distance. The Wildfire you are meant to hold in your hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast levels of the LCD unit are also quite underwhelming and we?re particularly disappointed with the depth of blacks on the Wildfire screen. The brightness levels are good but they are not enough of a boost for the overall poor picture quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the Wildfire isn?t any better when exposed to direct sunlight either. You will struggle to find a proper angle for working with the phone when outside on a bright sunny day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general, the screen is where most of the cost-cutting has been done on the Wildfire. This doesn?t seem like a particularly smart move. The fact is, on a full-touch device the screen is almost all you look at and use. Having such a relatively large yet low-res screen creates a rather negative effect for the whole user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note, the sensitivity of the capacitive touchscreen is excellent, plus 3.2? is more than enough space to press on. But still, a smaller display to make the low resolution less prominent might have made more sense, and the device would?ve been even more compact too. We just can?t see the point of making such a big QVGA screen. Neither Android nor HTC Sense looks good on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display we find four capacitive controls. They are in charge of bringing you back to the homescreen, opening the context menu, taking you a step back in the menu navigation and getting you to the quick search box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sufficiently spaced and sensitive enough, those cause no usability problems whatsoever. The transition between them and the screen is seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under those four keys we find the optical joystick, which by the way is of pretty limited use. It will work in some menus to replace sweep gestures and can be used to take the occasional photo but that?s about it. Most users would probably never notice even if it didn?t work at all,? you can get by just fine without it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we see the earpiece, the proximity sensor and the status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Wildfire features the large volume rocker and the exposed microUSB port. The right side of the device is completely bare. A dedicated camera key would have certainly been nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there are a couple of elements to note. The silver key in the right corner is the power/screen lock button, the 3.5mm audio jack is at the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tiny mouthpiece is the only thing of interest at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megaxpixel camera lens is near the top of the back cover, flanked by the loudspeaker grill and the LED flash. The lanyard also attaches at the back, near the bottom of the phone. You do need to remove the cover to attach it though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the cover you will find the microSD card slot and the 1300 mAh battery. The Li-Ion unit is quoted at up to 480 hours of stand-by or 7 hours and 20 minutes of talk time in 2G networks, and 690 hours and 8 hours in 3G mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are some impressive numbers indeed but here?s one case perhaps where the low-res screen does count in its favor. The Wildfire did last for about three days of moderate use (10 minutes of calls and just under an hour of using the other features a day), which is still good but not that great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire feels nice in the hand. Its size is just perfect for single-handed use and the screen sensitivity is a point in favor too. It?s ultimately the same screen though that puts the whole package in question. Users coming from touchscreen feature phones will probably not notice anything wrong. But upgraders from the Magic or the Tattoo might be disappointed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have no arguments with the build quality and the finish. The Wildfire is a solid looking and stylish phone that will suit conservative tastes. There?s a selection of paintjobs too for those looking for something more expressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let?s go through the software side of things.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eclair and HTC Sense deserve a higher-res screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense and Android have had a god run so far. From the Hero to the Desire, users have been treated to a wealth of graphics and features. Even the entry-level HTC Tattoo has the company?s custom interface, which we found to blend well and do a good job. It just didn?t look its best on the QVGA screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?ve been paying attention, you?d know the HTC Wildfire is having the same problem. And this time, the same number of pixels is stretched over 3.2 inches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wildfire still has a clear advantage over the Tattoo. The capacitive display has excellent response. You?ll find the latest Sense UI too on the HTC Wildfire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main differences between this version of the Sense UI and back on the Tattoo are the new context icons, a few new wallpapers and the unified Widget section. Whether you are using the People, Mail, Music or Gallery Tabs, the scrollable icons at the bottom will please you with new color skins. We like it this way ? the old ones looked a bit dull against the otherwise graphically rich and colorful UI..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left key at the bottom of the screen launches the main menu. This time around you simply tap to get to it, you can't drag the menu out, though you can drag it back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The middle key is a shortcut to the Phone app and the right key brings up the "Add to Home" menu. And there's plenty to add to the homescreen but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen you?re on - it can't be used for actual scrolling. HTC have extended the homescreen to a total of seven panes instead of the usual three. With all those widgets at hand (which are quite useful too) they may not even be enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense UI revolves around Scenes, which are essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen - for instance, the Work scene has a stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't modify the scenes but if you rearrange the current homescreen you are prompted to save changes as a new scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clean slate scene lets you start from scratch - it's just the default Android setup with a Clock and a few shortcuts underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization - the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now back to the other stuff beyond the homescreen and the available Scenes. The changes brought by the Sense UI go deeper than just the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For instance, the main menu has the typical grid layout, but you can switch it to a list similar to in TouchFLO in HTC WinMo phones. With it, you can use an alphabet scroll, which makes locating apps faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widget section has been revamped since the HTC Tattoo and now both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on one page. There are so many of them that you may find the seven homescreen panes insufficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and a different look (There are twelve different clocks. That's right, twelve!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And some widget styles even offer different functionality. Take the Twitter widget for instance - one version will show updates for the people you follow, while the other version only lets you tweet from the homescreen. There's nothing stopping you from using both of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC widgets offer a better level of interaction than the stock widgets ? there's a Favorites widget that keeps a list of your favorite contacts you can scroll through, meaning there?s no need to dip into the contacts list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo album widget is a "stack" of photos that shows all the photos in some folder and you can flick them to view the next photo in line. This is quite fun but the experience is somewhat ruined by optimization. During the animation of the photo going up and the next one settling in, the widget uses low resolution previews of the photos and it takes a couple of seconds for the next image to load up in full quality. Higher-res photos suffer the most from this, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages and Mail widgets work much the same way, but instead of photos, you flick messages. And you don't get the pixelation issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wildfire has the fancy way of accessing any of the homescreen panes without scrolling. With a single tap or pinch, Leap view displays the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to ?zoom out? on any of the homescreen panes but tapping on a screen will do the trick too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android 2.1 in the Wildfire packs the app sharing application for posting your impressions on mobile applications via Twitter, SMS or email. It?s very simple but helps you share or receive app impressions from various social services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leap View was available back on the HTC Desire ? it?s nice to have it in the budget package too. However, one thing the Wildfire obviously lacks is Live Wallpapers. The weaker CPU and the QVGA screen just can?t handle them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that?s about the part of the Sense UI that?s closest to the surface. There?s more to it but we?ll discuss those bits and pieces throughout the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire UI is fast enough, the only place to notice lags is in widgets that need internet connection to refresh content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trackpad is an auxiliary navigation tool here ? given the responsive capacitive touchscreen. You can swipe, scroll and precisely select elements with the trackpad but we were barely using it except in the camera app. It serves as the shutter key there but it?s far from essential, as the touch focus works well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two more things - most apps won't run without a microSD card inserted and screen vibration feedback works on the virtual QWERTY keyboard but not elsewhere throughout the homescreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Socialized phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Wildfire features the same powerful phonebook we first saw on the Hero. It resembles the one from the HTC TouchFLO but considerably extends its functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. What you'd notice though is that there are another five tabs at the bottom and you're just viewing the first of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab holds the messages received from the contact ? it would have been a lot more useful if it held the entire conversation, but for that you?d have to go to the Messages app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact. The next two tabs are quite interesting and can turn the Wildfire (or in fact any phone running the Sense UI) into a powerful social networking tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other - called "Albums" - pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log and "Online directories". The latter holds information for all your buddies? online profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Android 2.1, the HTC Wildfire packs the new Quick contacts feature. It lets you use the contact photo in the phonebook and call, text, or email the person with a single click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact editing screen looks exactly as in the HTC Desire. There's no plus key to add a new detail of a certain type, just a delete detail key. This saves some space (one line per each category) but you have to scroll down to the bottom every time you want to add a new detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a lot of information you can store per contact as usual, and searching the phonebook is very easy - just press the search button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality in calls is good and the volume levels are excellent. We experienced no reception issues with the HTC Wildfire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). Smart Dialing is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, the HTC Wildfire has turn-to-mute enabled. You can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down on the table. There?s an extra feature too ? the ringing volume will go down as soon as you lift the handset up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in proximity sensor makes sure the screen automatically switches off when you hold it next to your face during a call. That way you don?t risk pressing any keys by mistake with your ear or cheek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows the latest dialed, received and missed calls all in one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire doesn't have voice dialing but what at least some users are more likely to miss is video calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conducted our traditional loudspeaker test and here is how the Wildfire stacks among some other handsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire can handle all common types of messages - SMS, MMS and email. Google Talk is in charge of instant messaging. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of integration of that content as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen full QWERTY keyboard on the HTC Wildfire works in both portrait and landscape modes. Button size is decent and sensitivity just fine and we had no problems using the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating as the text box only takes a small part of the screen even if you hide the keyboard, which really only gives you little to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. After choosing a name it?s added in a bubble under the main textbox, where you can view or remove it by single tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia content to a text message will turn it into MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor depending on your needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two Email clients as usual: HTC Mail and Gmail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gmail is one thing that you can't expect to have changed much compared to other Android handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When replying to an email you can opt for either Gmail or the generic mail client, and set one of the two options as default. The reason behind most Android handsets coming with two email clients is the added corporate Exchange ActiveSync support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app is the same too. The general Inbox displays the last sync time, the sort order, the email account in use and the actual messages of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom there are five virtual buttons that let you filter the inbox. You may opt to view conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or display the messages from your VIP mail groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The chosen filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Wildfire lacks in terms of email features. What you basically have is a local copy of your Gmail account bundled with its main functionality plus a Microsoft Exchange compatible alternative client, which can manage multiple POP and IMAP accounts.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multi-touch image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery has the usual main menu list-with-thumbnail structure. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder - quite effective file management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the gallery will start reindexing the content each time you open it and it does so even when you open a file for an instant and then get back to the thumbnail view. And that's a bugger as when cards are full of content it's quite slow to complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the folder's name is a figure indicating the number of images stored. Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. The contextual menu of the main Album view has a single shortcut to the settings menu. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the main album there are three virtual buttons - one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and the final one for Flickr. The latter two display images from either account or those posted by your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anywhere in the gallery except the main Album view you can launch the camera or camcorder to capture new images, share them on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa, or eventually delete the selected image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the HTC Wildfire image folders you can choose between grid and filmstrip view. You can also mass delete images, but mass copy and paste options are still unavailable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you cannot copy/paste images from folder to folder (you'd need a proper file manager for that), you can still share multiple images from your albums on Facebook, Flickr, Gmail, HTC Mail, Messages, Peep and Picasa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire supports multi-touch and you can take the full advantage of this while browsing your images. Zooming in and out is done in the same fashion as on the Apple iPhone. You can zoom to 100% with simple double tap on the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed only from the Albums' subfolder as there is no dedicated video player icon in the main menu. The video files can also be viewed as a grid or filmstrip and can be shared via Gmail, HTC mail, Messages or YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player application on the HTC Wildfire has seen some cosmetic changes, but is still quite basic. The only new addition is the full screen mode, where the original clip is stretched / cropped to fit the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, the player is capable of playing only 3GP and MP4 videos up to QVGA resolution, which means that you will have to convert most your videos for watching on the HTC Wildfire.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Familiar music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As with the rest of the multimedia department, the music player is the same as in the HTC Legend and the Desire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing user interface, though very sleek and more comfortable doesn't offer new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed to find no contextual search in the music player for songs and related stuff on YouTube or Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other music player weaknesses of the Android platform still need addressing too ? there are no equalizer presets, nor any alternative visualizations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite for easier scrolling. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio guts of the HTC Wildfire are probably identical to what you can find inside the HTC Tattoo. As we already managed to confirm they are able to provide nicely clean audio output and pretty decent loudness (though the Tattoo is a tiny bit louder).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk are the best part of the HTC Wildfire audio output, but the frequency response is virtually spotless too. The distortion levels aren't the best we have seen but they are very good nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Wildfire vs HTC Tattoo frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Wildfire has a 5 megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1936 pixels and a LED flash. At least on paper, the Wildfire seems just as capable in terms of still imaging as the high-end HTC Desire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Android 2.1 the Wildfire has a camera interface that is competitive outside the Google OS world. There are a number of customizable settings ranging from ISO speed to aspect ratio and auto focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are yet to see modern-day features such as face, smile and blink detection for example, but the gap is closing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the usability is still pretty bad with most of the options sitting on a retractable tray at the left side of the viewfinder which can either be dragged out by a finger sweep or by pressing the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a shortcut for activating the flash and exposure compensation around the viewfinder but that?s pretty much that. The only other shortcut leads to the gallery and that hardly help much with the photography itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can?t quite comment on the HTC Wildfire image quality. Our unit has a major camera defect. It?s most likely a faulty lens ruining the entire left side of scenes. Interestingly though, it doesn?t affect macro shots ? in close focus the bad part of the lens is not used. Anyway, judging by the macro shots and the usable part of images ? colors are way off. To an extent that we can?t even imagine this ever passing quality control. We?re obviously out of luck here ? it?s simply a faulty unit and we?ll try and update this review shortly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples for you to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>CIF video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Wildfire records CIF videos at 15 fps, which is nothing to be excited about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is similar to the still camera?s and there is a surprising (by Android standards) number of customizable options. You can set the video resolution, encoding type and recording limit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as image adjustments are concerned you get exposure compensation, contrast, saturation and sharpness settings as well as color effects and white balances settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto focus is also there for you to enable but the Wildfire only focuses before the recording starts and acts as a fixed focus camera after that. In our test unit, this actually works in our favor ? there?s no trace of the blurring we saw in still images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But anyway, video quality is bad. There?s purple tint all over, the amount of resolved detail is poor and the framerate (15fps) ruins the whole thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a sample CIF@15fps video clip.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire offers a wide range of connectivity options. You get quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE securing worldwide roaming and dual-band (900/2100 MHz) 3G with HSDPA. The HSDPA is quoted at 7.2Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to local connectivity ? the Wildfire offers USB v2.0 connectivity via a microUSB port, Bluetooth v2.1 with A2DP support and Wi-Fi. Now that they?ve enabled Bluetooth transfers there is very little more to ask for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet tethering is also available via the microUSB port and it?s easy as pie to use. Just select tethering when prompted to choose connection mode. HTC have also thought of users without a data plan and allows them to explicitly forbid access to the mobile network internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we have to mention that the built-in microSD card slot can also be used as a data transfer tool. Card-readers are going for peanuts these days so having one around is quite likely and they give some pretty impressive speeds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser, Flash and all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The great web browsing skills have been an inherent part of the Android platform since day one. Now that we are at version 2.1 things are even sweeter with the intuitive user interface even more polished and the functionality reaching new heights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty much nonexistent at first glance. With pinch-zooming enabled you don?t even need the +/- zoom buttons that we have seen on most other Android handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address bar is locked at the top of the page so you can scroll down and hide that too. However you don?t need to scroll to the top every time you want to tap a new address ? just press the menu button and invoke it anywhere on the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wildfire browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, for comfortable reading of longer texts on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, open bookmarks. The last button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And to sweeten the deal even more, HTC Wildfire has Flash support in its web browser. Its performance is hardly spectacular but it?s better than nothing. You should definitely pick simpler Flash games, but it?s good enough for those to run just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash video support is also pretty dodgy with the Wildfire failing to play the Vimeo and Netcafe videos that we tried. YouTube works fine but it uses the preinstalled YouTube application so it doesn?t really count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.1 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but since that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm we won?t be crediting it with extra points.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire comes with the usual set of organizing apps. It also has a preinstalled document viewer, which handles office files just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quickoffice app can view Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For editing, you will need to get the paid app though. There is also a PDF viewer app that handles the PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. The Desk clock app turns your Wildfire into a? well Desk clock ? it displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app allows you to quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the Wildfire with you when doing sports. The Stopwatch and Timer apps are also onboard.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder might be pretty useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Footprints app lets you geotag images and save them in diverse categories such as favorites, shopping, dining, etc accompanied by a personal note. Once you take a picture of a place you can look up its address and location using Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Friend Stream shows the latest status updates of your friends. To use this widget/app you must link your profile to Facebook/Twitter/Flickr and have matching friends to your phone?s contact. After this is done properly, their latest updates will be noted in the Friend Stream widget/app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Peep app, which allows you to update your profile on the world?s largest social network. You?ll need to download the Facebook app since it?s not preloaded.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS and Google maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire comes with a built-in GPS receiver. It got satellite lock in just over two minutes without the A-GPS on, which isn?t too bad at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is standard equipment in any Android package and of course makes an appearance on the Wildfire as well. Unfortunately, voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation by Google Maps still has limited availability (US and a few European countries).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still plan a route and track your current location so it is better than nothing but you have to rely on network data for downloading the map info. Quite surprisingly, the pinch-zooming is available along with the double tap one, unlike the HTC Legend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Street View mode is supported in Google Maps and it?s probably the most fun part of Google Maps. It gives you a 360-degree view of the surroundings where it?s available. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like you?re taking a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no alternative navigation application preinstalled so if you want one, you will have to visit the Android market and pick one yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market is growing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The QVGA screen is limiting in terms of compatible content on the Android market. The market applies automatic filtering, listing only applications compatible with the QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subcategories (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all at once, but you will probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button and type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the essential ones are well covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, 100000 or so apps is nowhere near what the iPhone users have at their disposal but no one actually installs thousands of apps so you will probably find what you are looking for here too. Besides, the Android market is the one with the largest percentage of free apps across all platforms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 2.2 Froyo will allow installing apps on the memory card, so new elaborate apps and killer games are likely to appear as soon as it is released. This will boost the Android Market chances of catching-up with the Apple AppStore.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can't help we guess, but love the sound of it. Wildfire is a strong and beautiful name. The thing is it raises no less expectation than names like Legend or Hero. But we're talking entirely different leagues here. So a simple Desire mini would've told the whole story - and caused no confusion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or maybe it's us making it look too complicated when it isn't. There is no doubt the HTC Wildfire is aiming lower and it may as well be competitive enough. It's nearly an HTC Desire save for the screen and processing power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They didn't even try to be creative. HTC just went on to repackage an existing product for a different target market. You can be sure the HTC Wildfire wants to play by the book and avoid complications. It comes to inherit the Magic and the Tattoo and keep the likes of Samsung Galaxy 3 at a safe distance. It can't be too hard now, can it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson already did it with the XPERIA X10 mini. This one is in the same price bracket but still waiting for its Eclair upgrade. What makes it unique is the level of miniaturization - the X10 mini is unmatched in the ultra compact class. It's worth noting too that a QVGA screen makes a lot more sense in a package so small.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 is another mid-range droid, which isn't ashamed to be seen in QVGA. It's Wide QVGA to be precise but not that big of a difference. Powered by Eclair, the Galaxy 3 is about to start shipping. Native DivX/XviD support is one thing you can sure expect in a Samsung droid. The Galaxy 3 will cost some 300 euro at launch - that's a bit more than the Wildfire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are running a tight budget, a few older Droids might fit the bill. The Samsung Galaxy Spica and the HTC Tattoo are upgradable to Android v2.1 Eclair, while the LG Optimus still runs on the 1.6 Donut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica ? HTC Tattoo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over at the Symbian camp, the Sony Ericsson Vivaz will charge the same as the Wildfire but bring better specs, higher-res (though resistive) touchscreen and an excellent camera with 720p video. If you care about imaging, you should definitely check this one out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Vivaz</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Wildfire is trying to come across as the budget package. But we do need to define budget here. The simple truth is an HTC phone will never beat the price of a Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. On a second thought, the Wildfire is not trying perhaps to match the record of this absolute best-seller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way we see it, Wildfire's fits perfectly in HTC?s Android lineup. It?s not the cheapest Droid out there and it has its compromises but it seems as the cheapest and fastest route to Android 2.1. We don't think any of the Hero, Tattoo or Magic users will see it as a viable upgrade though. For us, the HTC Wildfire is more like the first-timers' Android smartphone.</paragraph>
