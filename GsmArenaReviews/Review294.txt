			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 slide was announced together with its slim sibling Nokia 6500 classic, but is far more than just an attempt to diversify the supply beyond the traditional bar form factor. Both handsets drive on solid style, but the stainless steel slider takes media another step further with video call support, FM radio and TV out. Nokia 6500 slide is among the handful of Finnish feature phones to offer a 3.2 megapixel camera, while Carl Zeiss optics, autofocus and the dual LED flash do make it a class in its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's more than logical to expect that both 6500 devices share a lot in terms of interface and basic functionality. And then, quite obviously, the slim 6500 classic just can't afford to accommodate as many goodies as its slider sibling. Much like the 3G-enabled Nokia 6500 classic, the quad-band Nokia 6500 slide also benefits from some of the latest communication technologies. Stay with us after the jump for more about what Nokia 6500 slide adds to the solid elegance that inspires the 6500 twosome.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Boxing OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 slide offers the usual box contents topped with some extras. In the slim package, which quite resembles the 6500 classic box, we found a charger (AC-4 Nokia Charger), a wired handsfree (HS-47 Nokia Wired Stereo Headset) and a microUSB cable (CA-101). Much like in the slim 6500 classic, the not-so-popular microUSB format is used. Currently, spare cables are somewhat hard to be found.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extras we mentioned are the TV-Out cable (CA-92U Nokia TV-Out Cable) and the pre-bundled 256 MB microSD card. Leaving that aside, the box reveals a CD with the required PC sync software, a manual and, finally, a quick start guide.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6500 slide 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stylish slide<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, there is no point comparing the slender girth of 6500 classic with the 6500 slide. Almost as thick as most normal bar-shaped handsets, the real strength of Nokia 6500 lies in the stylish design that we are really like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The solid feel and superior materials and the large and tactile keys and controls are just the right beginning of the user's relationship with the 6500 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how 6500 slide stacks up in the dimension scale - compared to the truly thin and compact Samsung Armani phone and another Finnish slider, the Nokia N95 8GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being of two minds about choice of appearance isn't the case with Nokia 6500 slide, as it only comes in silver, unlike Nokia 6500 classic, which has a black and a bronze outfit to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Examining the handset's body, one thing is strikingly noticeable: the crowded top side is not something we're used to seeing in mobile phones. But, one thing at a time, let's now start with the face of Nokia 6500 slide - the front panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece grill is placed dead center at the top, encompassed by the ambient light sensor and the secondary QCIF videocall camera, with the 2.2" display right under it. The display itself is of praiseworthy quality but we'll come back to that later in our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let us now pay due respect to the keypad. A few things ought to be mentioned here. Beginning with the good news, we have to say that the D-pad and the surrounding Call, End and two soft keys are among the best we have ever touched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This applies to an even greater extent to the standard alphanumeric sliding keyboard. Each key is big enough and the topmost row of keys enjoys a sufficient amount of headroom to ensure hassle-free usage. The tactile feedback is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sliding mechanism ruins the good impression. Generally, it is quite rigid and requires a hefty push halfway up until the spring steps in to finish off the sliding. Other than that, we spotted visible marks on the keys left by the sliding part that would potentially develop into more distinct grooves upon intensive usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone houses only the eyelet for attaching a neck or a wrist strap. The right side sports the dual volume rocker key and the camera key all the way down the bottom. The two-stage shutter key has very little elevation, but offers soft tactile response. Overall, it's one of the best we've tested lately. The volume rocker is also quite comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part is totally bare but the crowded top makes up for that big time. Topside we get the charger connector, the battery cover latch, the microUSB port and, finally, the 2.5mm AV connector for headset and TV-Out. With Nokia 6500 slide, the End key also serves as a Power button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone over, we come upon three key elements - the camera lens, the dual LED flash and the loudspeaker. Further details on those are to follow later on in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We will only mention here that the camera lens is unprotected and is therefore prone to scratches and fingerprints. The fact that it is slightly sunk in should probably ensure some protection but still isn't quite enough in our opinion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover gets easily removed once the arrow-labeled key on the top is pressed. The Nokia BP-5M battery with a capacity of 900 mAh is under it . It is supposed to provide 320 hours of standby or up to 6 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality these times are hardly achievable but you can still count on a good four days of operation under moderate use (15 minutes of calls plus about 45 minutes of using the other phone features a day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card slot is placed near the camera lens. It is not that effortless to release the metal hinge and remove the card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card slot is only accessible after removing the battery. Next to the memory card slot there is a sliding holder that ejects the SIM card. We have no complaints with that, but we do prefer the push-to-eject mechanism.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you already guessed, we love the build quality of Nokia 6500 slide. Materials of very high quality have been used and that makes it both a solid and elegant handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a different note, the backlighting is strong enough to facilitate usability both in daylight and in the dark. The ambient light sensor optimizes the screen brightness according to the environment.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Admirable Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 slide makes good use of its size with a screen of 2.2" diagonal, as opposed to the 2" display in the 6500 classic. The image quality is commendable. It is surely among the best on the market in any conditions - from the darkest to the most brightly sunlit spots, Nokia 6500 slide offers great quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither backlighting, nor contrast is user-configurable. In the menu you can only set the phone's behavior in power-saving mode. An animated screen-saver can be set to appear on the display and, consequently, convert into a screen-saver showing a digital clock, the current date, and icons indicating missed events, if any. All these details are perfectly legible in any light condition. In the menu you will also find a sleeping mode option, with which the display goes out completely.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might have guessed, signal reception and call clarity have not been compromised in Nokia 6500 slide. The calls are loud and clear on both ends and you will have no problems communicating with this phone. Video calls and videoconferencing are back on track to make up for a prominent absence in 6500 classic. Vibration is a bit weak but the loudspeaker is quite powerful. The phone ringing will be easy to hear even in the noisiest environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Nokia 6500 slide ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. You can find more info about our test, as well as results from other tested devices here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Series 40, 5th<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 slide brings no surprises in terms of user interface. Series 40 looks the straightforward choice for feature phones, and we're dealing with its 5th edition. We have to say navigating and controlling the phone are almost the same as with the previous UI editions and identical to, say, Nokia 7500. The phone still offers a vast number of configurable options but that somehow complicates the menu structure and navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are already starting to get tired of the same look and feel of this user interface. What good it is to buy a new phone that has a interface exactly as the one in your old phone. Perhaps some change in graphic appearance would be beneficial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When in stand-by, the display as usually visualizes the pre-selected wallpaper plus signal strength, battery status and time in the top bar. Beneath the top bar are the operator logo (if any) and the date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom bar is reserved for the descriptions of the functions assigned to the center of the navigation key and the two context keys. The center of the D-pad opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The font on the main display can be of any color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also turn on the active stand by mode if you want to. It consists of several parts that can be edited or relocated according to the user's preferences. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions indicated by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player and radio. At the very bottom events from the calendar are displayed set for the current day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature here, that even Nokia smartphones do not have straight out-of-the-box, is the possibility to add a note to the active stand-by. The two soft keys' functionality can also be varied if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu in Nokia 6500 slide can be displayed in four different ways: a grid of icons with or without captions, a list of items, and tabs. While each of them has its pros and cons our personal choice remains the typical grid view with legends. If you prefer more icons to appear simultaneously, you can go for the grid view without text, as it displays a 4 x 3 icon grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons themselves haven't been changed at all, keeping the well known stylish design. The selected icon is animated. The icons can also be freely reordered within the grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The submenus follow no consistent pattern. Some items have captions, others do not. In certain cases, you'll be even able to see tooltips, so you will not need to step further into another menu level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the menu items are intuitively accessible through keyboard shortcuts. The color background of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper on the display, can be easily modified by applying one of the pre-installed themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu responds quickly, without lagging or holdups. We wouldn't expect anything else from a Series 40 device anyway. Also, we didn't experience any halts or unexpected restarts for the time of our review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Themes galore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having in mind that looks are among the Nokia 6500 slide strong points, it is very important that the themes follow suit. Unluckily, the preinstalled themes are just the same we've seen in previous Nokia S40 models such as Nokia 6280. Fortunately, you can also download additional themes for your Nokia 6500 slide, however they are not as nearly as attractive as some of the Sony Ericsson flash themes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook leaves pleasurable impression<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Nokia 6500 slide offers space for up to 2000 contacts, as well as various configuration options. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First names are separated from last names eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization. Ringtones can be assigned to each contact. Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. The picture displayed is different for incoming and outgoing calls, as it fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and appears much smaller when you are calling any of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contacts list: List-of-Names, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Picture. It can display the SIM card contacts, the in-phone contacts or both at the same time. The phonebook font size can also be enlarged, should the user find that necessary, and it's an option that will surely be widely appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is done by gradual typing of the name of the corresponding contact. And that's not all: contacts can also be organized in groups and these can subsequently be used as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application worth our compliments is voice dial; no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary. There is also a training application that helps for better results when using voice commands and/or dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 6500 slide won't surprise anyone who has ever held a Series 40 device in their hands. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them together. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is great with this keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The message menu has not undergone any modifications either. It is organized almost perfectly. Besides standard text messages, Nokia 6500 slide is capable of receiving and sending multimedia messages, sound, flash messages, and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do in order to turn a regular SMS into an MMS is insert a picture or any other multimedia content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can insert through standard typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with the most recent addressees in the call register.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is even the very handy option to select a favorite message contact in case you have frequent correspondence with one and the same person. Everything in the editor is intuitive and is organized in a practical time-saving manner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes without saying that the phone also offers a rich T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will be divided into constantly visible. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS. MMS size limit for both send and receive is 300 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash messages are simple text messages that are instantly displayed upon receipt but are not automatically saved. The good news is that the Flash message will be immediately displayed also on non-Nokia phones; in our case we successfully tested the service with a Qtek 8600.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the audio message is technically also a MMS but obviously it is more important to people at Nokia and they have created a separate editor for it. The software editor can either record the message as you go or use a previously recorded sound clip. Unfortunately, adding text to it is impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is luckily no longer a built-in Java application but the fully functional email client instead, that we have come to know from most Nokia smartphones. That makes it much faster and generally better than the one used in Nokia 6300 for example. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email boxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Sent attachments are not limited in size. Both message headers only and entire messages can be downloaded, depending on your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under messaging the Yahoo!Go feature is also available, a third-party service provided by Yahoo! Inc. The convenient service is optimized for small-screen browsing on handsets and gives access to yahoo mail, calendar, and weather, along with stocks, news, blogs, mobile search, etc.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player comes with XpressMusic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is almost identical to the one used in the Nokia 5300 XpressMusic phone and the Nokia 7500 Prism. It is a great player originally reserved for music-oriented Nokia phones and is obviously becoming the standard player for all recent Series 40 devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player works with AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, MP4, WMA, AMR-NB, Mobile XMF, SP-MIDI, MIDI Tones (64-tone poly) and True tones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The supported A2DP profile allows listening on Bluetooth wireless earphones. The player is highly customizable through a number of themes that are at your disposal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, there is a second skin that seems to suit it better compared to the conservative default skin. As in Nokia 6500 classic, the now playing tracks are displayed on the active home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides managing all the typical functions of a music player, it also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. Different playlists can also be created to meet specific user requirements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the retail package you will find the HS-47 wired Nokia stereo headset, connectable via the 2.5 mm AV jack. The headphones manage quite decent sound and their quality will certainly meet most criteria. They get to be appreciated even more provided that the 6500 slide is not a music dedicated phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving back to the player, we have to say that it offers a large number of configurable options. The sonic experience is enhanced by equalizers and a stereo expansion function, which somehow failed to impress us. The equalizers do deserve attention, as they perform very well, while the opportunity to set own equalizer presets completes the range of possibilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with Nokia 7500 Prism, changing the equalizer preset has an almost instant effect without the usual couple-of-seconds lag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 slide has only one loudspeaker located on its rear cover, right next to the camera. We did already mention that it is among the loudest we tried, though. A good thing is that it does not get muffled at all when the phone body is placed on its back on an even surface such as a desk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were more than glad to realize that audio quality in Nokia 6500 slide is consistent with the commendable overall performance of the device. Our audio quality test showed very good results and convinced us that the slider is one of Nokia&#x2019;s best tries in this aspect. It is only a fraction worse than Nokia N81 and is not that far away from the high Apple iPhone standard either. You can find more details about the test itself here. And there go the results, so you can see for yourselves what a talented musician Nokia 6500 slide actually is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo FM radio with Visual radio and RDS is another important difference from the 6500 classic. It uses the audio player interface and has the well known functions. The Visual radio application is helpful as it can download the radio stations in your area and save them to the handset with their names when an internet connection is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is compatible with the 3GP and MP4 formats. The player supports video files of up to 30fps in VGA resolution for 3GP and MPEG-4 with a 2048 kbps bitrate or up to 15fps in QCIF resolution for 3GP at 192 kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The possibility to remove the soft key captions to make better use of the full screen view mode is nice and improves video watching experience greatly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, as the phone has the CA-92U TV-Out cable supplied in the retail package, people can take advantage of watching still pictures or video files on the home TV set.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3.2 Megapixel Carl Zeiss AF camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For the first time in a Series 40 phone we are delighted to see a very good 3.2 megapixel autofocus CMOS camera with Carl Zeiss optics. More to mention is the integrated dual LED flash and the video recording capability at 15 fps in VGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6500 slide camera produces images of up to 2048 x 1536 pixels resolution. The camera menu and the available settings are not at the highest level, compared to the camera interface of N95 for example, but will do the job, indeed. They include white balance, three quality settings going form basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available extras. The flash can be forced to on, regardless of the light conditions, and used as a fill flash. Naturally, an automatic mode for the LED is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2-step capture key is one of the best we've ever used, with a deep and soft stroke. Other than that, the center of the D-pad can also be used for shooting pictures. Pressing and holding it will force the autofocus to lock and releasing the key will capture the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera performance is just what we could expect with Carl Zeiss optics - crisp images and nice detail. Noise level is relatively low, especially with sufficient light. The autofocus camera does well at close-ups, quite pleasing for a high-end feature phone. The Nokia 6500 slide is surprisingly good as a cameraphone, although Nokia doesn't advertise it as a camera-centric device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as disadvantages are concerned the 6500 slide camera seems to produces somewhat unnaturally pumped up colors. That however is not a deal breaker as images still look good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 slide is officially quoted to record VGA video at 15 fps in MPEG-4, but as it turns out, the recorded clips are in 3gp format. We haven't got the slightest notion of why Nokia decided to squeeze the recorded clips in 3gp format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video quality is average, but it still fails to achieve the contrast and detail of MPEG-4 recordings. The noise level is surprisingly low, though sharpness is negatively affected . 4x digital zoom is available when shooting video, but as usual, it results in a severe loss of detail, especially at the maximum level. The length of videos in 3GP format is only limited by the free memory available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery could have done better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on Nokia 6500 slide is identical to that in 6500 classic. We personally aren't great fans of how the gallery looks in Series 40 models but, as it's used as a file manager at the same time, it is understandable. For example you do need those few extra presses to get to your music files, as there is no file filtering. The Gallery relies on you putting the right type of files in the right folder. The supported graphics formats include BMP, GIF87a, GIF89a, JPEG, PNG and WBMP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. They all have their advantages and disadvantages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is quite slow and doesn't allow a picture to be zoomed in too closely, so actually it is not much of a help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures can also be viewed in fullscreen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter however offers very limited options, but considering the fact that there are very few users that actually use a picture editor on their phones, this is understandable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search options. The latter is quite convenient for finding a specific file in overfed folders but we still believe that gallery on Series 40 could be improved a lot. That goes true especially in user friendliness and we do hope that sometime in the future the file manager and the gallery of these phones will be separate applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2.5 mm jack and TV-Out support set the Nokia 6500 slide apart from its classic sibling. The rest of the connectivity offerings are identical. The main focus here is the USB connectivity and it is really seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand the microUSB is not as widespread as the miniUSB, but this may just be how the future is shaping. Upon connection of the USB cable, it prompts you to select the connection mode. You can then alternate these modes by only a few keypresses. Moreover, Mass storage is available, allowing your phone's memory to be directly accessed from a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bluetooth version is 2.0 and A2DP is supported, allowing stereo wireless connection. Other supported Bluetooth profiles include: AVRCP, DUN, FTP, GAP, GAVDP, GOEP, HFP, HSP, OPP, SAP, SDAP, SDP, and SPP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity options include the network support - luckily Nokia 6500 slide supports 3G for faster data transfers, as well as EDGE and GPRS where 3G is not available. The memory card slot is also onboard to expand the built-in 20MB user available memory with up to 4GB cards. There's no Infrared port and Wi-Fi is not among the features either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 slide has an integrated WAP browser, which also manages HTML pages. No significant changes in functionality have been made and it is identical to the one used in Nokia 6300. Font size modifications are available, as usual. When set at the smallest font, the screen displays up to 11 lines of text. Direct address entering is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia browser faces serious competition from another brilliant application - the famous Opera Mini. The latter is pre-installed and is definitely our first choice for browsing the web on Nokia 6500 slide. It is far more intuitive and fits text better than the integrated browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer: time-proven performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer brings no novelties either, and, frankly, it needs none. Month, week, and day views are available for the calendar. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are five types of events: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Further, each type of event has its own specific fields like start and end time, type of alert with various advance intervals, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handy to-do manager that enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. They are easily synced with the calendar application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are available as well; their length limit is 3000 characters. The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize snooze time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute length limit, stopwatch, countdown timer and a calculator. They are all easily operable and decently looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time however, the calculator is not as elaborate as in Nokia 6300 for example. It offers fewer mathematical functions but at least the essentials are still there for the user.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Additional applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 slide comes with a decent number of preinstalled applications outside the organizer. The consistently useful unit convertor is first in the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Download! Application follows, which directly connects to the Nokia download center, where you can find a lot of downloadable content for you phone, most of it free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Presenter is a piece of software, which takes control over the PC upon a Bluetooth connection. The Presenter will be mostly usable for managing PowerPoint presentations, but it can be paired with other PC applications too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first we thought the Search application was an in-phone search tool, but it turned out to be the built-in Yahoo! Search. After setting the country or region you can conduct web search for images and other information. The 20 most relevant search results are returned to your phone upon request. Find out more about the Search at nokia.com</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Sensor application is a Bluetooth-based tool for creating your own Bluetooth portal and for sharing information with other Sensor users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To finish it off, the World clock is the well known application, which allows checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let the games begin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming lovers will probably appreciate the preinstalled content, as it includes five games. The first one we don't come across too often in the mobile phones we review - the Backgammon II game is the Java interpretation of the popular board game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw Snake III in the 6500 classic and the slide has it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Highroller Casino is a game that will meet the appreciation of gambling lovers, as it includes some of the most popular gambling games, such as Texas Hold'em Poker and Blackjack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sport simulation Golf Tour has decent graphics and is comparatively easy to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last game is the Rally 3D simulation. It is a classic racing game that car fans will sure appreciate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6500 slide is a hard one to define and, though formally of the same bloodline, the 6500 classic isn't any better of a reference point. Nokia 6500 slide focus is on the imaging capabilities, plus, the brushed stainless steel exterior puts it in a more exclusive league.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6500 slide is high on exclusivity and style but in a reserved or laid-back manner. It's not a cameraphone but has a very good camera. It's solid and capable but means less business than smartphones. It scores very high, both in terms of design and functionality, but is caught in crossfire due to its high price tag. With enough flashy premium handsets, heavyweight all-in-ones and practical but smart performers, pressure is coming from all ends on this otherwise highly recommendable device.</paragraph>
