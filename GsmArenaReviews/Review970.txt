			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung is in no mood to invest much time and effort in its Galaxy Tab range of tablets. With the Note family getting the premium treatment, the new generation of Tabs would suffice with a mild facelift and a software upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's especially true at the bottom of the range, where the seven-inch Galaxy Tab 3 is getting ready to take over from its predecessor with the new S4 styling and Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. That's right, only the smallest tablet in the lineup didn't get the latest OS version available. This may be partly due to the new Marvell chipset used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we'll try to squeeze a couple of benchmarks in this preview to see whether the Marvell silicon is actually an upgrade or otherwise. Other than that, Samsung clearly decided to put an emphasis on the exterior, keeping most of the internals unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 has the same screen resolution as its predecessor, WSVGA (600 x 1024), which is the lowest available on a tablet. OK, we don't think WVGA tablets should count. The rear camera is a 3.15MP unit and the front camera resolution is up from VGA to 1.3MP.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>These are by no means exceptional specs but the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is clearly a tablet for the budget-conscious users. Support for voice calls is what sets it apart from the hordes of Android seven-inchers, most of which are obviously better-equipped at or around the same price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With almost no meaningful additions to the hardware, the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 will find it hard to convince Galaxy Tab 2 owners to consider upgrading. At least one thing it does right though - the newer model is obviously more compact and lightweight than the predecessor. The quality build and comfortable handling also help the Galaxy Tab start off on the right foot in the budget tablet range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardware is, as usual, our next stop in this quick preview. You're welcome to follow us on the next page and get a better feel of Samsung's latest compact tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is more compact than its predecessor, measuring 10.9 x 187.9 x 99mm. Its weight has been reduced too, to just 300 grams, making it really easy to handle even with one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The looks of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 have nothing to do with the previous generation of the tablet. The company is known for following a consistent design scheme across its range of devices, and the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is no exception. It's styled after the company flagship, the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has seen to it that the third generation of Galaxy tablets uses the company's latest design language. The edges have been straightened and the bezels are slimmer than before - though the seven-inch tablet cannot rival the Galaxy Tab 8.0 on that. The sides are done in a faux-aluminum finish, which looks really nice, especially against the tablet's white body coating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the body, it's made entirely out of plastic. While it doesn't feel bad to the touch, it's not as nice as the rubberized back of the Nexus 7, for example, or the aluminum body of an iPad mini. While the Galaxy S4 boasts a nice looking pattern of its plastic, that's not something that the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 can boast with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual speaker grilles at the bottom are a nice touch - the fact aside that this obviously isn't the best location. Not as big a deal though on a seven-incher, as it is on a bigger tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The US version of the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is said to offer an IR blaster on the side, but our unit didn't have it. Overall, this design is getting a bit overused - it's what you get across the Samsung Android lineup, from the smallest screens (Galaxy Young) to the largest 10.1" slates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to its narrow bezels and fairly slim waistline, the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is probably one of the most portable 7" tablets, and that earns it some bonus points.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 has a 7" TFT display of a rather low resolution, 1024 x 600 pixels working out at just 169ppi. Rivals such as the Nexus 7 and ASUS Memo Pad HD pack 1280 x 800 pixel screens at the same real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have to take into account that bigger screens are usually held further from the eyes, which partially makes up for the lower pixel density. However, even at some distance, you'll still spot the lower sharpness, especially when looking at text. Other than that, image quality is reasonable for the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LCD screen is has decent brightness and pretty decent contrast with very good black levels. Sunlight legibility is tolerable, but the high reflectivity of the screen certainly takes its toll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 features a standard set of sensors on its front (proximity and ambient light), along with a 1.3MP camera clustered around the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other side of the screen is the traditional trio of a hardware Home button and capacitive Menu and Back keys. Stock Android has moved away from this arrangement, but Samsung insist on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing at the top but the 3.5mm audio jack. There's no secondary microphone for stereo audio recording or noise cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated camera shutter key either, but the volume rocker can be set to act as a zoom lever, still or video camera shutter key. The power/lock button is above it, both located on the right side. Above them is a secondary microphone used for noise cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the opposite side there are the microSD and SIM card slots. Both are covered with plastic flaps to protect the slots from filling with dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 features a microUSB port with MHL functionality, so you can output HD video with the appropriate dongle. The mic pinhole is next to the USB port. On the left and right sides sit the speaker grilles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the back of the device there's the 3MP autofocus camera lens, centrally placed at the top. It protrudes from the 8mm thick body and the device rests on it when placed on its back, which makes it unstable and means you should be careful not to put it on a surface that can scratch the lens glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the camera there isn't a LED flash, as it'd be both unnecessary for this type of camera and an expenditure considering the tablet's price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery can't be accessed, as the back cover isn't made to be user-removed. It's a 4,000 mAh battery, which is about right for a tablet of this size (although the Ascend Mate has a larger juice pack in a 6.1" device).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is shipping with Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. As usual it is skinned with Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz UI, which adds a considerable amount of customizations to the interface. It's a pity Samsung doesn't ship the slate with the newer 4.2.2 version of Jelly Bean, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the latest version of TouchWiz is present and unlike previous iterations, this one tries to stay relatively close to stock Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short user interface video to get you quickly familiarized with the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is a standard "tap and drag in any direction to unlock" deal with light flairs accompanied by sound as you drag your finger. Five customizable shortcuts are available at the bottom of the screen - drag one up to launch the app without going through the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several options for the unlock screen. You can enable a news ticker at the bottom of the lockscreen, which is a great way to stay up to date on current events. The ticker can be expanded to view all news items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are alternative unlock routines as well - Face unlock, Face and voice unlock, unlock by touching the screen and tilting the phone and starting the camera from the lockscreen by touching the screen and rotating the phone horizontally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are voice-based wakeup commands that can just start S Voice or launch a preselected app. You can also enable a second clock on the lockscreen, which shows up when you're roaming. Most of these features can be switched off too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you make it past the lockscreen, you'll notice that the dock at the bottom of the screen now fits six shortcuts or folders. The rightmost one opens the app drawer as usual, but you can change the other five to any shortcut you like or even folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the notification area there are five (eight in landscape mode) visible toggles that can quickly enable and disable radios. There are more than five toggles, of course; you can swipe horizontally to get to the others. Or you can tap the new button in the upper right that reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, 11 in total.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible). Another nice trick is to long press on a toggle to go to the related settings (e.g. Wi-Fi settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider, complete with an Auto toggle. You can disable this slider to have more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks mostly the same. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like S Planner, S Memo, etc. There's the so called wrap around feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 homescreen auto-rotates, just like on most tablets, enabling landscape use of the entire interface. It reacts correspondingly when in landscape mode, even on the home and lockscreens, which is welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go to when you press the Home button - any of the available homescreen panes can be set as default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works the same as on a homescreen, giving you an overview of all panes as thumbnails. There's, by the way, a dedicated pane, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps, apps can be swiped to dismiss and there are three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, Samsung's Multi-window feature isn't present on the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0. It wouldn't have made much sense at this resolution, so it's not a major drawback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's a vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app; swiping an app sideways removes it from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few Samsung-made tweaks here - a button at the bottom of the list to bring out the home-brewed task manager, a button to end all apps at once and a shortcut to Google Now. By the way, you can also bring up Google Now by pressing and holding the Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like what Samsung has done with the latest iteration of TouchWiz. The company has put together an impressive list of features and options, but that's not a bad thing - the default setup is good enough for regular users, while power users get to have it their way without the need for third party apps. However, there are also some features that are missing, when they really didn't have to. Some of them include the likes of homescreen silhouette previews when adding new widgets, as well as lockscreen unlocking effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of the latest Android Jelly Bean version is also a noticeable lack of the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0, but isn't too much of an issue in our eyes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has gone for the Marvell PXA986 chipset which packs an all too familiar combination of two Cortex A9 cores. With a clock speed of 1.2GHz, the combo doesn't sound particularly exciting, but we've seen it do alright in the past and in this price range that's more than enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it's a good match for a budget offering and should behave reasonably in our series of benchmark tests. The amount of RAM is on par with rivals in the category, but isn't groundbreaking considering most high-end phones now pack 2GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with BenchMark Pi, the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 manages to score 483 points, just 16 better than the previous generation of the tablet. Maybe a step forward for Marvell over the older TI chipset, but hardly a big step for the device itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Linpack, the Marvell chipset starts to show its technological age and falls further behind other tablets in the list. Two cores only get you so far, and the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 gets demolished by the likes of the quad-core Nexus 7 and Galaxy Note 10.1.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We suspect web browsing will be one of the primary jobs of the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 and running Jelly Bean means an optimized JavaScript engine. As a result, the web-based benchmarks ended with decent results for the 7 incher. It even manages to beat the Apple A5 chipset (dual 1GHz Cortex-A9) but that's not much of a surprise.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the dual-core Cortex-A9 configuration behaves pretty much as expected. It's not going to win any races, but it gets the job done. Occasional lags were inevitable we guess, but some of those may be down to our test unit being a pre-market sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony, phonebook and messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the defining features that stands above the otherwise budget nature of the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is its SIM card slot. It not only gives you full-blown voice calling and messaging, it'll even do 3G video calls with the front-facing VGA camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use either the loudspeaker or a headset to make your calls. If you prefer, you can even place the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 next to your ear and still manage to make a call thanks to the earpiece (there's even a proximity sensor), although you'll look rather ridiculous doing so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picking a contact to call is fairly easy - you have smart dial, a call log if you need to call someone back and Favorites, which display large tiles with the photos of your favorite contacts. Voice dialing is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact management is straightforward on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0. Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account (other accounts too, as well as social networks and IM profiles) unless you explicitly disable this feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are displayed using a two-column interface that's present in several other key apps and really puts all the screen estate to good use. The left column lists all the contacts, with the contact info on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can easily send messages and emails, call contacts and view the wealth of info stored in the phonebook. You can join contacts, which comes in handy when you install Facebook, Skype, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging app layout is similar to the phonebook - on the left you get the threads, on the right are the messages in each thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung is well known with its great video players and the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is no exception. The video players offers several view modes - grid, list, folders and nearby devices (which accesses DLNA devices).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view shows 8 thumbnails of videos at a time (they aren't live video thumbnails, sadly), while the list view gives you a better overview of all the files that are stored on the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. Dolby Mobile is available in the video player to enhance your audio experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Somewhat surprisingly, considering the modes chipset, the video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it - starting with WMV all the way to AVI (DivX and XviD), as well as MPEG4 and MKV (H.264). Resolution wasn't a problem either - the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 played FullHD files without a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 also made a good impression when it offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video. It can also play embedded subtitles within MKV files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Tab 3 7.0 supports Pop up play - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A new Android version always comes with an improved web browser and the Jelly Bean browser running on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is no exception. It looks much like Google Chrome and has pretty much the same functionality sans the cross-platform sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is the same as most of the desktop browsers - a top row with all the opened tabs, and a second row with the back and forward buttons, the URL bar with a refresh button, the tab switching key and the bookmarks key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as find on page, save for offline viewing, request desktop site and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which lets you surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature in the browser is the Print option, which lets you print out web pages straight from your phone. Unfortunately, this only works with Samsung printers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer you can also use the preloaded Chrome which offers excellent cross-platform sync capabilities. It's quite similar in terms of interface, features (sans the Quick Controls), and behavior. Sometimes it's even faster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a launch price of $199, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 is aiming at the bottom end of the tablet market and should be ready to face plenty of super-compact slates by prominent brands and white-label manufacturers alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung must've done its homework though and seem confident that the Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 stands a reasonably good chance despite the clearly low-end specs. The screen resolution is scraping the bottom of the barrel and the chipset isn't exactly setting the benchmarks ablaze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice call support is this tablet's ace up the sleeve. Probably not all tablet users care about this feature but it virtually narrows down the meaningful competition to a single device - the Asus Fonepad. If nothing else, this gets the Samsung entry-level tablet some breathing space in an otherwise very crowded market.</paragraph>
