			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's an easy one to miss. With Mango phones coming from far and wide and droids well at cruising speed, a new smartphone on an emerging platform is going to struggle to get noticed. Apparently, Samsung are in a mood for a fight. The third generation of the Wave is here to make a difference. The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 runs a completely redesigned Bada OS 2.0, and flaunts a bigger and better screen. It's blazing fast too on that 1.4 GHz Snapdragon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada OS has made the jump to a new major version and the interface can hold its own even against high-end Androids. It is gentle on the hardware too and runs glitch-free on the single-core processor. There's real multi-tasking and one of the best video players on a smartphone. All that in a remarkably solid and stylish metal shell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No more teasing, here comes the complete feature list and the potential deal-breakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For people coming from Android, the limited supply in Samsung?s app store will be a major question mark. But the Bada app store has been building up content. It's still a long way from closing the gap on the leaders but there's been enough progress to convince users to leave some of the prejudices at the door. Anyone looking at this new Wave with an open mind may find it fresh, efficient and friendly. But well, the Samsung S8600 Wave 3 will have to do its part too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, it certainly is an attention grabber. The compelling exterior is a promise for a solid performance. And we'll hold the Wave 3 to it. Follow us on the next page where we start with unboxing and the usual hardware tour.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Wave 3 brings no surprises<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 comes in a small box with a microUSB charger, a microUSB data cable and an in-ear headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no microSD card in the bundle. The available built-in storage includes 1GB for user files and 2GB for system storage and apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S8600 Wave 3 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S86000 Wave 3 measures 125.9 x 64.2 x 9.9mm. It's almost the same size as the preceding S8530 Wave II but they managed to squeeze in a bigger 4" screen. The Wave 3 weighs 122g ? 13g lighter than its predecessor ? and it's impressively slim.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 has a solid metal body with the traditional brushed finish. It's a slim and very stylish handset with a consciously minimalist exterior and what comes close to a unibody design. The rear cover doesn't completely detach from the body - once unhinged it slides up to let you access the battery and memory and SIM slots. The aluminium cover wraps around the sides of the phone. The rounded edges feel great in hand and the design is almost seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is dominated by the 4" SuperAMOLED screen, which makes the otherwise subtle design come alive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is the same unit as the one in the original Galaxy S, a 4" SuperAMOLED of WVGA resolution. The deep blacks are quick to impress and even though the screen is not as bright as LCDs, it has very good sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display uses a PenTile matrix, which reduces the sharpness of the display - it only has two subpixels per pixel, instead of three. It's still one of the better mobile screens around and undoubtedly an asset of the S8600 Wave 3. You may recall that the Wave 2 wasn't that lucky - it had an LCD display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its two predecessors, the Wave 3 uses capacitive call keys around the Home key. They're not backlit when idle and the single massive Home key is a prominent accent on the minimalist front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display are the earpiece and the video-call camera, along with the proximity sensor. Samsung Wave 3 also adds an ambient light sensor to the mix, which was missing on the Wave and Wave II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung S8600 Wave 3 features the volume rocker, which is rather thin and not very comfortable to use. The Lock key on the right is even smaller but placed conveniently under your thumb - that goes for right-handed users though. There's no camera shutter key this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's nothing at the top of the handset, with all the connectivity ports at the bottom. Here we find the microUSB port and the 3.5mm audio jack, and the mouthpiece in between. The bottom is not the most convenient place for the headphone jack but the peculiar sliding battery cover forced that solution on the designers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back, the interesting bits are concentrated near the top. The 5MP camera comes with a LED flash and the loudspeaker grill is next to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens is sufficiently recessed into the body of the phone, which keeps it out of the way of scratches and fingerprints. The loudspeaker on the other hand only has a small nub, which doesn't help against the sound getting muffled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brushed aluminium on the back is a big part of the phone's appeal and is in a way a certificate of ancestry. The downside is the polished metal surface doesn't allow a secure grip. Pressing a latch at the bottom lets you to slide the entire case up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It slides up to a point, enough to reveal the 1500mAh battery, the SIM compartment and the microSD card slot. The battery is rated at 8 and a half hours of talk time and 480 hours of standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the SIM and microSD card slot are blocked by the battery, which needs to be out if you're going to be ejecting or inserting a card in either slot. That's something we wish Samsung had fixed - the Wave and Wave II didn?t have a hot-swappable microSD slot either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 is well-built and has the appearance of a true flagship. Many high-end droids would kill for looks like that. The brushed metal case is impressive and the unibody slider design is a novelty you'd be eager to show off. On the front, the Gorilla Glass covered SuperAMOLED looks great and adds to the phone's overall durability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 3 is not a small set by any measure, but not much bigger than a I9000 Galaxy S. It's as slim as the I9000 Galaxy S and barely heavier (just 3 grams more) despite the metal on the back. It should slip into most pockets trouble free and feels great in the hand too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bada OS 2 premieres here<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 runs the latest v2.0 of the Bada OS, decisively better looking and with deep-running changes to how things are done. On the face of it, the Bada looks like Android more than ever. But well, yes, that one goes down to TouchWiz.The custom skin Samsung put on their droids started off as feature phone platform to evolve into a stand-alone smartphone OS. We're now looking at a major overhaul of Bada and we like what we see. Now, let's talk about how it handles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a video of the Samsung Wave 3 user interface in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada 2.0 brings a new element to the homescreen - the Live Panel, essentially a scrollable dedicated pane of full-sized widgets. There are new contextual menus, the gallery, media players and the web browser have been updated. Much has changed since Bada 1.2 so let?s get down to the details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some basic weather info has been added to the lockscreen. It's not a dynamic weather widget, all you get is a simple temperature reading and a current weather icon. In case of a missed event, swiping on the notification will take relevant action. If the music player is running, you'll get the music widget at the top of the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen can stretch over up to ten panes to fill with widgets and shortcuts. There's a scrollable widget dedicated homescreen pane, called Live Panel. It comes with full-size widgets such as AccuWeather, Yahoo Finance, AP mobile, calendar and search. You can choose their ordering and enable or disable them as you please. But you cannot remove them altogether or add new ones. The bottom of the Live Panel is reserved for contact shortcuts. You can place as many favourite contact pictures there as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single hardware control on the Wave 3 (the Home key) switches between the regular homescreen and the Live Panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The regular hom&#x435;screen can be expanded into up to ten panes, which can be filled with shortcuts, widgets (again!) and folders. Our review unit offered a choice of a few standard widgets to place along these panes, such as an analog and digital clock, memo, calendar and weather. There are more at the app market for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen panes would also readily accommodate application shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on any homescreen will allows to edit the contents of that specific pane, while a pinch zoom displays an aggregate view of all active panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is almost the same as before. The big difference to Android is you cannot pull it down bit by bit - it's a tap to expand, tap to collapse. There are switches for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, sound and auto rotation. Music controls are displayed too if the player is running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada 2.0 is a proper multitasking platform, so naturally, you get that on the Wave 3. The task manager is accessed by a long press on the Menu button so you can easily switch between currently active applications or terminate them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is flat, all available items and applications initially spreading across two screens of icons. If needed, you can add up to 7 more. Icons align in a 4 x 4 grid and you can reposition them the way you like. Scrolling the menu screens is looped, so when you reach the last pane you don?t have to sweep all the way back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 3 looks a lot like a droid. A big part of this is TouchWiz, which creates a consistent and familiar environment for all Samsung users. Although the Bada OS is heavily indebted to Android, there are some important differences. The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 has a single hardware control. A Menu key is the first thing experienced Android users are likely to miss. One thing directly resulting from this absence is the fact that all application-specific settings are packed together in the general settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, if you're adding a contact for example, you won't be able to access the phonebook settings. You'll have to go back to the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the absence of Menu and Back buttons, the previous Bada edition relied heavily on on-screen soft keys. We like it how the new version pretty much gets rid of them. The swipe gestures in the phonebook and inbox are nothing new but they did well to keep them. Now, that's another thing you get in Android too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Upgraded phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wave 3's phonebook has rich functionality and practically unlimited capacity. The handset displays the phone memory and SIM-stored contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you really can have all of your contacts gathered in one place. If you want to use your Exchange contacts too, you not only need to set up your Exchange account properly, but you need to import them in the Contacts settings. It?s a very easy step, but it took us a while to realize why our Google contacts were not available in the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search the entries by either kinetic scrolling or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen. There's a Search bar at the top of the contact list too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields available for each contact, but it remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada OS has a cool phonebook feature, which is also available in TouchWiz-skinned Androids. A right swipe over a name in the contact list will dial the contact?s default number while a left swipe will start the Message composer. In Bada 2.0, in whatever direction you swipe, you?ll reveal four shortcut keys: Call, New Message, Video Call and Delete. The side-sweeps work in other lists too where you have names or numbers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 handles calls trouble-free, no choppy audio or reception issues. There is no secondary microphone for active noise cancellation here. And no smart dial either. Not a proper one, at least. The Wave 3 will only recognize digits and suggest corresponding numbers from the phonebook. But it won't suggest names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include muting, using the keypad, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation. The call log can be activated with the call receiver key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 3 supports video calls and there's a relevant button in the dialler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the S8600 Wave 3. It snatched an Average score. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 supports SMS, MMS, and email. Texts and multimedia messages share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging app has been completely redesigned in Bada 2.0 and now it resembles the corresponding apps in Android and iOS. It only offers Conversation view, but in the Advanced tab you can create folders to archive your messages and filter spam and system messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? reveal a menu with shortcuts for Call, Video Call, Block Number or Delete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to email, setting up your account on the third-gen Wave is hassle-free. You just need to go to the Accounts section in the Main Settings and set up whatever emails you need ? Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, Exchange or other. In most cases, you?ll just need to enter your username and password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you can tweak. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported and you can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting in roaming. The email client supports SSL encryption too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client looks pretty much like the Android app. It supports conversations and in the upper left corner you can switch to the advanced folder view. Multiple accounts are supported and there is a shared inbox for all your emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on an email message will once again reveal a hidden menu with options for Download/Reply, Forwarding, Block or Delete.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Rich input options, Siri-like voice commands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Capacitive touchscreens usually won't give you handwriting recognition but, just like the previous two versions, the S8600 Wave 3 is among the few exceptions. The handwriting screen has two viewing modes ? full screen or a dedicated handwriting box (usually taking about half of your screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer typing to drawing, go for the on-screen keyboards. You get diverse options - a portrait numpad and a landscape full-QWERTY keyboard with or without the T9 Trace enabled. The so-called Continuous input is similar to the popular Swype. You tap on the screen and move from letter to letter without lifting the finger. Just like Swype, the Continuous input guesses the word you?re trying to write (even if you weren?t that accurate) and places suggestions in the text above the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That should allow you to write up to 40 words per minute. Now, that?s fast typing! Plus, if you prefer the old way of typing letter-by-letter, it?s still available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 3 supports voice dictation and voice commands very similar to the iPhone 4S?s Siri. The major difference is your Wave 3 can?t actually speak.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the voice dictation works just like on the iPhone 4S ? you tap on the Mic key on your virtual keyboard and speak. Then your Wave 3 will write everything down for you. The service is powered by Vlingo and is not as smooth as the Siri, but most of the time it works just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you double tap on the Home key you?ll get to the Voice Commands interface. You can do things Siri-style, but the software isn?t that smart. For example to compose a message you say the relevant command and the name of the addressee. After you've said the name though, you must say something like Message or Tell for the software to know where the actual text of the message starts. If you want proper punctuation, you?ll have to specifically dictate all the commas and question marks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice commands can be used for voice dialling, text messages, emails, web searches, memos, playing songs or playlists, and social updates (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). You can?t create appointments and alarms, and no - you will not get replies to the questions you ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are voice alerts too for things like incoming messages and status updates. Your phone can read messages out. You can download different voices for free at the Samsung Apps store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Credit to Samsung for trying to expand the voice recognition capabilities of the Bada OS, even if it isn?t the next Siri.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery has gone Android-ish<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another thing that got redesigned under Bada 2.0 is the gallery, which - no surprise - takes after Android. It's fluid and efficient, and prettier than before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports kinetic scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pinch zooming is also available here thanks to the Samsung Wave 3 multi-touch support but you can also double tap on the screen to zoom in and out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 3 gallery shows the pictures in full resolution unlike most Android handsets, so zooming on a picture will reveal much more detail. Like the Android galleries, the Wave 3 offers rotate and crop tools too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Still the best video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Media is certainly a S8600 Wave 3 forte. The large Super AMOLED screen is great for watching videos. The interface of the video player is quite simple, yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 3 supports DivX/XviD/MP4/H.264/MKV files and the AC3 audio codec is on board too. And what is even more impressive, subtitles are welcome as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Higher-res playback is impressively glitch-free ? the Wave 3 handled 720p videos with ease. Not a big surprise considering the Wave 3 records 720p videos itself, but it?s still impressive for a mobile phone. We threw everything we had at it ? DivX, XviD, MP4 and even MKV files - all in 720p resolution. The Samsung Wave 3 played them silky-smooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New design for the music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like the gallery, the Bada 2.0 music player has been redesigned to look like the one in TouchWiz-skinned droids. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface looks even better when you use the music player in landscape mode. Browsing albums or tracks is pretty standard in portrait mode: you get a list of all songs or albums, each with a small thumb. The list is smoothly scrollable with impressive kinetic effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're browsing in landscape mode you'll be getting an album art reel of virtual CDs. Tapping on a CD will expand it to show all the tracks within the selected album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, sweeping down across the screen (from the arrow above the central CD) will display a virtual dial to let you search the albums or tracks alphabetically.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 8 stations as favourites that are accessible right on the main screen. The rest of the available radio stations are still a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also listen to the FM radio on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FM audio recording is also available. The recorded files are stored in MP3 format in your music folder.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is nothing to write home about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Wave 3 S8600 is a very capable musician for its class, but if you are looking for sonic perfection you'll have to take your business elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the Wave 3 is averagely loud with excellent noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings. The total harmonic distortion is kept well under control as well, but the frequency response and intermodulation distortion are not quite ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a pair of headphones plugged in, the Samsung Wave 3 S8600 experiences a rise in stereo crosstalk and gets a bit of extra interdmodulation distortion, but we're actually used to seeing worse from smartphones. In fact the Wave 3 scores better in the headphones on test, compared to its competitors, than it did in the initial test.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A very good 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like its predecessor, the Samsung S8600 Wave 3 is capable of taking 5 megapixel photos and capturing 720p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera viewfinder is quite reminiscent of company's recent cameraphones. The comfortable interface is nicely touch-optimized and has all you need on the two vertical bars on each side of the viewfinder, but there is an option to hide them both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the important settings are user-configurable: ISO, white balance, default storage, stabilizer, face and blink detection, geotagging etc. You can switch the default storage between the main memory and the microSD card. Touch-focus is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8600 Wave 3 produces excellent photos for a 5-megapixel cameraphone. The amount of resolved detail and the contrast are very good, with noise kept well under control. Here go the Samsung Wave 3 samples.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 steps up in our photo quality compare tool to face other 5MP shooters. The tool's page will give you more information on what to look out for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 3 captures similar pictures as the Wave and Wave II, but offers better colors and contrast. It did very good on all the three posters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung S8600 Wave 3 in the Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface has very few visible options, while the rest are hidden in the advanced settings menu ? effects, stabilization, exposure, white balance and resolution. You can also switch to the front-facing camera, which is capable of recording up to VGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Wave 3 captures 720p@30fps videos. The resolved detail is lower than we would have liked, but overall the quality is good and will probably fit the most users? needs. Contrast is good too and the noise levels and compression are quite low. Motion is smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a 720p@30fps video sample from the Samsung Wave 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is another one that we uploaded on YouTube for your convenience.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's time for the Samsung S8600 Wave 3 to go into our video quality comparison database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as synthetic resolution goes, it did average. Compared to the previous two Waves the Wave 3 produced better colors and contrast though. Overall, although the videos are quite unimpressive, they are on par with most of the droids released this year. It seems the video recording is not a top priority feature for most manufacturers (outside the specs sheet).</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity misses NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All kinds of network connectivity are at the user disposal - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSPA. The GSM/EDGE networking of course comes in quad-band flavor and the 3G in dual-band - 900/2100MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S8600 Wave 3 supports Bluetooth version 3.0. Naturally, A2DP is also supported. To activate Bluetooth (and Wi-Fi), you can use the dedicated control hidden in the notification area on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some apps like the Samsung Store, Facebook or Twitter require a configured packet data profile and an active SIM card to use Wi-Fi connectivity. Still those services don?t actually use packet data instead of Wi-Fi, they just check if it?s available. Strange indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of Wi-Fi connectivity, the Wave 3 supports 802.11 a/b/g/n connectivity as well as Wi-Fi Direct. Thanks to the latter you are able to exchange files with other Wi-Fi Direct-capable gadgets and no Wi-Fi router is required. It works just like the Bluetooth transfers usually do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Mobile AP you can also turn your Samsung Wave 3 into a wireless hotspot for connecting up to three Wi-Fi clients that will use its HSDPA connection for Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8600 Wave 3 is DLNA-capable device. You can use the AllShare app to connect with other DLNA-enabled gadgets to share music, picture and video content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8600 Wave 3 also packs a standard microUSB port. You can choose from 4 connection modes - Modem, Mass storage, Samsung Kies and USB debugging. Samsung Kies is the new software used to connect your Samsung mobile phone to a computer. In Mass Storage mode the phone mounts its internal memory (1GB user-accessible) and the inserted memory card as removable drives on the computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our review unit was not NFC-capable but since Samsung claims it the other way round, we guess, it would be an optional feature much like it was with the Samsung Galaxy S II.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dolphin is your web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S8600 Wave 3 packs the latest version same Webkit-based Samsung Dolphin Browser, but this time looks a bit different - it resembles the Android's browser. Yes, we know we said that before. At least twice. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the refresh button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in or pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in/out with pinch gestures or use double tap. Text reflow is available on works great. There is kinetic scrolling too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada 2.0 offers Flash Lite support and most of the banners and even the 360p embedded videos played well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dolphin browser also offers download manager, search on page and quick access to brightness settings. If you tap and hold on some text you?ll get the usual selection tools, copy and translate options too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 comes with the full version of Polaris Office on board. It supports creating, viewing and editing Word, Excel and PowerPoint files including the Office 2007 versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also add location, participants and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. It also hosts the world clock, stop-watch and timer functions. There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit. Oh, the Wave 3 packs a voice recorder as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo, Tasks, Voice Recorder and Desk clock are self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social Hub is the messaging and media sharing Holy Grail ? this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services ? SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Search works on everything in your phone ? contacts, images, music, videos, emails, history, apps, etc. It works excellent and helps when you have lots of content. It also offers internet search with Google or Bing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Caster app also comes pre-installed. Its functionality is similar to the Social Hub ? you can easily share various content with different social services. The Dolphin browser has a dedicated Send to Caster key, so it might be a good idea configuring the Caster app as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Apps is your only app store, Music hub is for music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Bada OS offers a native application repository from its start ? the Samsung Apps. Samsung Apps is very similar to the Android Market. It has three tabs ? featured, top and category view. There is also a download section and search option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Apps store is expanding fast, but we can?t say the same for its quality. Still there are thousands apps inside, so you?ll probably find a lot useful tools and fun games in there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while this growth sure is impressive, the Samsung Apps store is far behind Apple?s App Store, Google?s Android Market or even the Windows Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a music store called Music Hub. Its functionality is pretty much the same as the iTunes store - you can buy signle tracks or whole albums from there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation costs a lot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled navigation software on the Samsung S8600 Wave 3 can easily turn the handset in a fully functional SatNav system - especially thanks to the sensitive GPS receiver on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wave 3 comes supplied with the Samsung LBS app, which is based on the ROUTE66 mobile application. Though its maps graphics have somewhat outdated looks, feature-wise there's really nothing missing. It has voice-guided navigation and a huge number of additional features, but the extra features come at a price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation software comes with 30-day trial license for voice-guided navigation (drive and walk). After that you?ll need a subscription, which is quite expensive. All other goodies require some extra payment and the whole package will cost you a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is still no native Google Maps app.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Bada OS may be squeezed for space in a market dominated by Android and with Windows Phone getting a boost from a software update and the emergence of a new major player. The platform's latest flagship though is a different story. Up against some formidable rivals, it's outnumbered and often outclassed - but not outwilled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, it's a gorgeous metal-clad phone that will not shrink in the presence of Android or WinPho7 flagships. In fact, many high-end droids will gladly swap their stark plastic uniforms for the brushed aluminum outfit of the Wave 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9001 Galaxy Plus is a particularly relevant example. The two phones are practically the same - from the 4" SuperAMOLED screens to the 1.4GHz processors. But if you have to choose one and know nothing about phones - which one will it be? A boring piece of plastic or the solid metal bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 3 is the most powerful Bada device to date, designed to show the updated OS at its best. The 4? SuperAMOLED screen and the excellent design and build are an invitation to explore. And if you give it a try, you'd find a mature and good-looking OS, and a solid feature set with above average media capabilities. The video player alone was a pleasant surprise and the camera isn't bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave 3 is a solid upgrade too over a predecessor, which was essentially a step back for Bada. The S8530 Wave II had to sacrifice the SuperAMOLED screen for a Super Clear LCD unit, and had a less-capable processor. So, even if gets updated to the latest OS version, it won't be a threat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8530 Wave II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger threat of course will come from mid-to-high end droids like the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc s and the Xperia ray. The LG Optimus Black and the HTC Rhyme are also on the list of potential competitors. They all run Android 2.3 Gingerbread and there's screen size for all tastes in the sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson Xperia arc s ? Sony Ericsson ray ? LG Optimus Black ? HTC Rhyme</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s been almost two years since we first met the original Wave. The Bada OS has been around for some time now but it has failed to make the splash Samsung were hoping for. The OS is still around though, and getting better. There could hardly have been bigger proof of Samsung?s commitment to Bada than the beautiful new flagship, Wave 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back at the start, the idea was to make a smartphone for the masses. Well, Android is already there. The Wave 3 could have been a smartphone for the bored with Android - but it's too much like it. Don't let this sound like the Samsung S8600 Wave 3 doesn't know where it's heading. It may as well be the same place where you're going. Meaning less third party apps but style to share.</paragraph>
