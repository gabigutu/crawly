			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Day 2 of Alcatel's announcements and we were back for another hands-on experience. Today we got the flagship - actually Idol 3C with a new paint job, the rest are a number of competitive, reasonably priced smartphones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Idol 3C<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 3C is the de facto flagship of the IFA 2015 lineup. It's technically a more colorful version of the Idol 3 that was unveiled in March at the MWC. The hardware is identical ? note that we're talking about the 5.5" version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The major difference (if you could call it that) is that you can pop off the back cover, Alcatel offers a number of brightly colored options to replace it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what the Idol 3C looks like with the yellow back.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Pop Up hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Pop Up wants to offer performance on a tight budget. It slips under the 3rd gen Moto G and offers a similar 5" 720p screen, camera department (13MP/1080p on the back, 5MP/1080p on the front) and runs Android Lollipop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's powered by quad-core processor, which is clocked at 1GHz and with just 1GB of RAM. There's no 2GB RAM, 16GB storage option though. Still, at &#x20ac;180 it's a good &#x20ac;50 below the Moto G (3rd gen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back covers are exchangeable. They are rather glossy, but surprisingly did not attract fingerprints.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Pop Star<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Pop Stars are even more budget-friendly than the Pop Ups. Starting at &#x20ac;110 for the 3G version (with a couple of extra back covers in the box) this one targets the Moto E with Motomaker-like customizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get 20 different options for the back covers, including real metal, wood and leather. The quality doesn?t match what you would get on a Moto X obviously, but getting several of these in a box is a steal. A cute little feature has you scanning a QR code on the cover you put on so that the phone will automatically load a theme that matches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 4G version of the Alcatel Pop Star for &#x20ac;130, prices for extra covers were kept secret. The basics of the Pop Star include a 5" 720p screen, 8MP/1080p + 5MP/1080p cameras and, surprisingly, a faster 1.3GHz quad-core processor with 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pixi First<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Pixi is the baby Alcatel, a small KitKat-running phone with a 4" WVGA screen (that's 480x800px). You get optional dual-SIM (no LTE though), a 1.3GHz quad-core processor with a somewhat limited amount of RAM (512MB) and a 5MP/1080p camera on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen quality is rather poor (it's not just the resolution either), the plastic body is rather glossy though the matte finish option was genuinely nice. The UI felt surprisingly smooth given the limited RAM, but you should keep your expectations grounded.</paragraph>
