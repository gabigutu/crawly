			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Squeezing your flagship smartphone in a tinier, sportier shell is the fad in Android these days. Not the one to blindly follow the pack, Sony has chosen to do things differently. The Xperia ZR didn't get as far down as the Galaxy S4 mini and the One mini, and got a 4.55" display rather than a 4.3" diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, unlike its HTC and Samsung rivals, the Sony Xperia ZR is keen to match the oomph of its flagship, offering better IP protection at that. Considering how important dust and water resistance were for the Xperia Z' success, some may as well consider this one as an upgrade, rather than a trimmed down version. There's also the proper shutter key - the Xperia ZR comes across as the better photographer too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery capacity has been kept the same, and it's even user-removable this time. Together with the smaller screen of slightly lower resolution and stamina mode, you get a smartphone that's not only easier to pocket, but one that will last more than the premium package. Now, how's that not a winning combo? Here goes the complete list of Xperia ZR pros and cons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, basically all you'll be losing if you chose the Sony Xperia ZR over the Xperia Z is some screen estate, the 1080p front-facing camera and the Full HD display. We wouldn't call any of those a deal-breaker, though: the smaller screen favors portability and, at this size, 720p is more than adequate. As for the video-call camera, most video-chat apps don't really support much higher resolutions anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems then that Sony has another potential winner on its hands. The Xperia ZR might just be what the company needed to cruise through the next quarter and allow enough development time for the Honami and Xperia Z Ultra, which look like the kinds of projects they wouldn't want to rush.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We need to see whether the smartphone behaves as promised, getting the most out of an impressive feature set. We start with the full physical right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR comes with the usual set of accessories for a smartphone - flagship or not. There's the essential USB cable and a wall-mount plug as well as a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We haven't seen a microSD card supplied in a retail package for a long time and this one is no exception. The 8GB internal memory is what you will have to do out of the box, until you find time to get an expansion card yourself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looked from the front, the Xperia ZR is an instantly recognizable member of the Sony smartphone family and a slightly downsized clone of the Xperia Z. However, it lacks the cool looking glass panel at the back, which takes away much of the premium feel and look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the plastic used in its place is of sufficiently high quality, so the Xperia ZR is still a looker. And the matte finish has a serious advantage over what the Xperia Z had - it's far less prone to fingerprints, so it doesn't require as much effort to look its best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Sony Xperia ZR have a different glossy finish, adding a second color tone to the exterior. The effect is much more prominent on the two brighter-colored versions, pink and blue, but is also noticeable on the more classic white and black handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The richer color palette is another thing the Xperia ZR has over the Xperia Z - the flagship does have a purple version, but we believe the ladies will prefer the pink of the more compact device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final perk of the Xperia ZR design is its removable back panel, which grants you access to its battery. Sure it adds a millimeter or two of thickness and takes away some of the high-end vibe, but we are sure many will find this an agreeable trade.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The layout of controls on the Sony Xperia ZR sticks to what seems the norm across the Sony smartphone lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting from the top of the front panel you get the earpiece, with the VGA front-facing camera on one side, and the ambient light and proximity sensors on the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the rest of its siblings launched this year, the Xperia ZR relies on virtual on-screen keys rather than hardware buttons, so there is nothing to see below the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary microphone has been moved to the bottom of the phone, right next to the lanyard eyelet. The secondary one is at the back, but it's only visible when you remove the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the MHL-enabled microUSB with USB host support. It's located underneath a small plastic cap, which helps maintain the IP58-required levels of water resistance. There are a couple of dock connectors below the port, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jumping to the Xperia ZR's right side you see the volume rocker, the smartphone's signature power/lock key and the camera key. The shutter key could have been a bit wider and could have provided more tactile feedback, but it's certainly something you can get used to quickly enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Launching the camera straight from sleep state and enabling more comfortable photo taking without introducing needless camera shake by touching the screen, the camera key is a definite asset. It's also something the Xperia ZR can use to lure some people away from the Xperia Z, which lacks such a button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top, you get another plastic lid with the 3.5mm audio jack hiding underneath. While the cover does well to keep dust away (in addition to the water-proofing), it does have a somewhat negative effect on its accessibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back, we spot the 13 megapixel camera lens, the LED flash and the loudspeaker grille. That's the exact same camera as on the Xperia Z flagship, but we are hoping Sony got the processing right this time (an update was issued for the Xperia Z specifically for that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the back cover sit the microSD and microSIM card slots as well as the smartphone's juice pack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>According to the official numbers, the 2300 mAh battery that should keep the smartphone going for up to 13 hours of talk-time or 520 hours of stand-by. The numbers come slightly short of what the Xperia Z promised, but the real-life performance is a market improvement over the 5" flagship. The Xperia ZR managed an endurance rating of 62h in our dedicated test, easily beating its sibling in each of the tests and matching its stand-by efficiency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's hardly a surprise considering that the batteries and chipsets are the same and the ZR has a clear advantage as far as screen estate and resolution are concerned. We did experience strange battery drain on a couple of occasions when we left the phone idle overnight, so it wasn't always so great, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's a 4.55" 720p (1280 x 720) LCD on the Sony Xperia ZR and the Mobile BRAVIA 2 engine to boost image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolution is more than twice lower than on the Xperia Z, but since the screen size has also been decreased so the pixel density stands at the cool 323 ppi. It's as great as on the Xperia Z, but frankly you'd have to be looking from way closer than is comfortable to notice it. And since 1080p would have lead to an increase in battery consumption we'd say Sony made the right call here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness is adequate and the contrast looks good even without the Bravia engine optimizations. You can enable the BRAVIA 2 for a dash of extra punchiness to your colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the viewing angles on the Xperia ZR display are somewhat better than those of the Xperia Z screen. It's still far from perfect and you start to see contrast compression and color shift quite quickly, but the screen remains legible for longer than the Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Sony Xperia ZR in bright outdoor conditions turned out quite a trouble-free experience. The smartphone even managed to slightly outdo the Xperia Z in our test.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Jelly Bean user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're reviewing the Xperia ZR running on Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean, but you're most likely to get it with 4.2 - updates are currently rolling out for the Xperia Z and ZL, with the ZR next in line. Moreover, Sony has already committed to a schedule for Android 4.3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyhow, here is a demo video of the Sony Xperia ZR in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZR gives you the option to add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and assign any of them as the default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background for the virtual on-screen buttons is no longer gray in favor of black, which we much prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done with a tap-and-hold on a blank area or using the pinch-to-zoom gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to perform various customizations on your phone - add widgets or shortcuts, change the wallpaper and the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it across to the homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZR has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The Timescape and Mediascape widgets are gone for good. Thankfully, the widgets in the Xperia ZR do resize and re-arrange automatically when you're trying to place them. These features were missing in some Xperia phones of old, despite them running Jelly Bean and we're glad Sony has fixed this in the ZR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a new theme changes the lock and homescreen wallpapers and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.). Depending on the theme you've chosen, the LED strip below the screen will light up in matching color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can preview the theme you're about to apply by dragging its icon onto the homescreen pane. Making it stick is simply a matter of returning to any of the homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are five docked shortcuts (two each side of the app drawer shortcut). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them. You can also place whole folders there in which case you get smaller icons of the first four items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen uses cool default animations and has two shortcuts for quick access to the camera (swipe left) and to the dedicated music controls (swipe right). The hardware shutter key actually makes the camera shortcut redundant - it will launch the camera even if the device is locked. When the music player is active, the lockscreen will display the music controls by default, but you swipe them out of the way. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area now features a few toggles (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Mobile Data). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. Unfortunately, you can't rearrange, remove or add new toggles to the mix. You're left with what Sony thinks is the most regularly used assortment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. If you tap and hold on an app a green Add to Homescreen area will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon there and you will go back to your homescreens where you can put a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager of the Sony Xperia ZR is the pure Android kind. It lacks the small apps and doesn't come with a "kill all" option. You can only swipe thumbnails to the side to close apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Data usage system service is onboard too. It lets you set a limit for network data for a specific period and usage is broken down by apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR uses a Snapdragon APQ8064 S4 Pro chipset, the same that powers the Xperia Z and Xperia ZL. It packs four 1.5GHz Krait cores, 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU. Just as we expected, it matches the performance of Sony Xperia Z and Xperia ZL almost perfectly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are superior chipsets now - the Snapdragon 600 chipset is a fine example, powering the likes of the Galaxy S4 and the Optimus G Pro, and so is the Cortex-A15 (Galaxy S4). But the Xperia ZR SoC is still doing a fine job and we didn't see it chocking with any task we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Benchmark Pi, which is all about single-threaded performance the Xperia ZR posted a great score, beaten only be the newer, higher-clocked Krait 300 processors and the Xperia SP, which also has an advantage in terms of clock speed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Linpack score was pretty great too, the four cores letting the Xperia ZR easily trash the dual-core Xperia SP.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the AnTuTu score of the Sony Xperia ZR came somewhat short of those of the Xperia Z and Xperia ZL. It's still a pretty solid showing though, even if benchmark geeks probably won't be happy with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things went back to normal with Quadrant - the Xperia ZR matched the Xperia Z and Xperia ZL and was only left behind by the newer Snapdragon 600 chipsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 tests processing power and memory performance. The Sony Xperia ZR didn't have the best of times here, scoring way of the newer Qualcomm chipsets and even being unable to match the Xperia SP score.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran GLBenchmark off-screen, which means we're able to test the raw GPU power. There were hardly any surprises here with Xperia ZR scoring as high as the Xperia Z, the Oppo Find 5 and the Nexus 4, and a tad better than the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But most games will probably want to run at native resolution, so we're including Epic Citadel, which uses the Unreal Engine 3. Here, the Xperia ZR took full advantage of its lower-res screen and placed on top, although the difference is negligible - all devices were running against the 60fps screen limits for most of the test anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Chrome web browser is the only one available on the Xperia ZR, so it's what we used for the JavaScript benchmark. The Xperia ZR scored 1310ms, which isn't a spectacular score by any means, but it's not too bad either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark 2 is an HTML 5-based benchmark and saw the Sony Xperia ZR with a decent score, but one that is surprisingly a couple of hundred points below the Xperia Z's.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vellamo focuses on JavaScript and HTML 5 and is where the Xperia ZR came pretty close to the top.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum things up, the Sony Xperia ZR has plenty of raw processing power at its hands. With the Snapdragon 600 around and the Snapdragon 800 just around the corner, the smartphone stands no chance of being a benchmark champion, but it has more than enough oomph to handle day to day tasks smoothly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now at your command<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know if there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Xperia ZR gets activated with an upward swipe from a press-and-hold of the Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've a review of all popular voice assistants, where you can learn even more about Google Now. Just follow this link.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR phonebook has also been upgraded since the last iteration under JB and, thanks to the light background, it looks livelier. The bottom bar holds shortcuts to search option, add number field, and the advanced settings menu. The tabs for Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs have been moved to the top and can be side-swiped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings a pop-up windows with shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too. This is where the LED strip comes into play as well. You can set a custom color for a contact, so the ambience light can serve as a caller ID of sorts. Of course you cannot possibly have a different color for every single contact in your phonebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia ZR was problem-free. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation, so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad in the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia ZR automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Xperia ZR with ClearAudio+ on and off. The results were frankly quite disappointing and the phone got Below Average marks. With or without the ClearAudio+ switched on, the Sony Xperia ZR got equally low results. This means you'll have to keep the Xperia ZR close to you at all times or you'll risk not hearing it when it rings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia ZR offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable - the screen is big enough to house decently-sized keys that are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different skin, or even a new key layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't allow the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Album gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can opt to show all of your albums in one place, and there are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can use pinch gestures to make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller. The whole thing is super responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids in a nifty animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Map reminds us of the iOS gallery, where all geotagged pictures are shown on a world map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab displays pictures from Google Picasa and Facebook. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos much like you did in the previous Xperia Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the LED strip below the display lights up with different color (similar with the image on the screen) every time you scroll through the pictures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy video player, plays everything but struggles with AC3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a new interface. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies you have preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZR did great with almost any file type and video codec we threw at it, including DivX and XviD. The only exceptions were MKV files and AC3 audio - videos with this audio codec played with no sound whatsoever.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player we've been seeing in Xperia smartphones since the second half of 2012, is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it has even more sound enhancement options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman interface is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music info such as album, year released, etc. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, as well as shortcuts to the library, an "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's a new ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music when listening on the pre-bundled Sony headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audiophiles will be pleased to find a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. There're even more elaborate alternatives at the Play Store, with support for a 10 or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whenever the music player is on, there are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app automatically scans and saves stations in range, although you'll need to have a set of headphones attached to use as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Play Music is onboard as well. It went through a major UI overhaul and is now snappier and better looking. It features the brand new Listen Now feature which tries to determine what you like and uses the pattern of how you change tracks, so it can offer you relevant music to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen uses the song album art and gives you a quick shortcut to the rest of the artist's songs along with the basic play controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR performed excellently in the first part of our traditional audio quality test and was about on par with even the premium Xperia Z. The smartphone got great scores all over, and if it wasn't for its only average volume levels, it would have been perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's very little quality drop when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk rises somewhat and some distortion creeps in, but neither of those is easy to notice without dedicated equipment. Volume levels remain average, but the overall performance is still quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Improved 13 MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR is equipped with a 13 megapixel camera that can produce still shots with a maximum resolution of 4128 x 3096 pixels. However, if you use the default Superior auto mode, you only get 12 MP 3920 x 2940 shots instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the Superior auto mode and regular mode with all settings set to auto is that the first tries to guess what kind of scene you are trying to capture and adjusts all properties accordingly - color saturation, contrast, metering mode, whatnot. The regular auto mode only sets the exposure automatically, but lets you fiddle with the other settings if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the Superior auto mode also tells you what it guessed so you can easily intervene if it gets it wrong. From our experience so far though, it gets things right almost every time, so unless you are keen to always have your say or just have to have that extra megapixel of resolution, you're probably better off sticking to Superior auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, stills/video switch, and a front/rear camera toggle. On the left, you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three customizable shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all available settings for the selected shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia ZR camera offers a wealth of features, including face detection, smile shutter, geotagging, touch capture and HDR mode. There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera shortcut on the lockscreen does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go for simply launching the camera in either still or movie mode, or you can set it to immediately snap a photo/start capturing video. This might come in handy for those shots you just can't afford to miss, but is also useful when you don't want to waste your battery keeping the camera interface constantly going (it's quite the power hog).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the camera module is the same thing we had on the Xperia Z and Xperia ZL, the firmware has been tweaked a bit to make the right kind of difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like before, photos taken in Superior auto mode have pleasing, albeit slightly oversaturated colors. The contrast is good, as is the dynamic range. The resolved detail is slightly better on the Xperia ZR, compared to the Xperia Z, but so is noise. The results are good overall, although we wouldn't say the Xperia ZR is a match for the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you use the regular auto mode, you get images that appear more natural and lack that overprocessed look. They also have a tiny bit more detail and less noise and while their colors aren't as punchy by default they give you more headroom if you plan on post-processing your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, Sony has finally addressed the issue we encountered with the Xperia Z and Xperia ZL, where regular image processing was too heavy and you had to use Burst mode if you needed the best per-pixel sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Truth be told, the Burst mode shots are still a dash more detailed than those shot in regular auto, but the difference is really minor this time and is more than compensated for by the less noise present on the regular shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This mean you no longer have to choose between full-res shots and maximum amount of detail - you can have the best of both worlds with the regular auto mode. And here go a couple of Burst mode shots so you can see the difference for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On with the camera tour, we also gave the HDR feature a whirl. The Xperia ZR did a great job adding extra detail in both highlights and shadow area, but not overdoing it and ending up with an unrealistically flat shot. There's some loss of detail though, particularly when you don't have very steady hands and the shots don't align too well. Here are the samples.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR challenges the best 13MP shooters in town but it's pretty clear that it can't quite match the level of detail of the Galaxy S4 and LG Optimus G. Still it holds its ground pretty well against most of the other shooters, so it's not a bad performance overall.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Xperia ZR does 1080p HDR videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR is capable of capturing 1080p video at 30fps, which is on par with most modern day smartphones. However, as a nice extra touch, the smartphone also offers HDR for video capture, making it only the third one to have that after the Oppo Find 5 and Sony's own Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came as a massive disappointment is the fact that even though the Xperia ZR is able to shoot stills while recording video, the images have the dismal 1MP of resolution. That's less than half the resolution of the individual video frames and not really good for much. Given that last year's flagships could capture full res stills during video recording, what the Xperia ZR offers is plain poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's a minor thing however and what's important is the Xperia ZR does the important things right. Videos come with very good detail and a 29fps framerate. Their bitrate hovers about the 17MBps mark, which is a decent compromise between quality and file size. Audio is recorded at 128Kbps and is a 2 channel stereo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 1080p video sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 1080p video sample as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The benefits of the HDR mode are not always as easily visible as we hoped, but it still adds some detail in the highlight areas, which, on some occasions, can mean the difference between usable and poor video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The full-HD videos of the Sony Xperia ZR are nowhere near the best we have seen, but they are still in the running. The Sony smartphone matched the Optimus G and the Galaxy S4 in the first two charts, but came a distant third in the last test. The tool's page will let you compare the Xperia ZR against other smartphones and give you instructions on what too for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR has quad-band 2G and up to quad-band 3G connectivity depending on your regional model. Mobile data speeds can hit the impressive 21Mbps of HSDPA and 5.8Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content on your phone with a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles charging and PC connectivity, and there's also USB On-the-go so you can attach external flash drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media Remote isn't preinstalled on the Xperia ZR but you can get it off the Google Play Store for free. It will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. There are a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history. This sort of a remote only works over the Wi-Fi connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also enabled on the Xperia ZR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZR comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, which replaces the former LiveWare manager, although the functionality remains basically the same. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use the Smart Connect app for DLNA purposes (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is the sole web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZR comes with Google Chrome as the only web browser out of the box instead of the generic Android browser. Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as the stock Android varieties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with the settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi range and want to go easy on your data plan, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's deeper settings, you'll also have the option to turn form auto-fill and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome does not support Adobe Flash, and neither does Android Jelly Bean in the first place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR comes with the latest version of the OfficeSuite 7 viewer. OfficeSuite 7 lets you view almost any type of document, although you'll have to buy the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Notes app that comes with the Xperia ZR. There's also Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver app helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. It can be set to also turn off Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or disable mobile data when the screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and it also offers advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are available within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in other locations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're looking for even more PIM options, the Google Play store is full of free apps that can cater to all your needs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps with offline maps, navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia ZR comes with Google Maps and Navigation (region specific). Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location. You'd usually need to download the dedicated Street View app from the Play store but our Sony Xperia ZR did have it preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's app uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache Berlin and parts of the surroundings before Maps told us the area is too big. There's no address search either in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab another from the Android Market - there are both free and paid alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store is the gate to the app world<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running Android Jelly Bean, the Xperia ZR has access to the latest apps and the microSD-expandable memory guarantees you won't have trouble with storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It should be obvious by this point that the Sony Xperia ZR is not just another shrink-to-fit exercise like most of them minis. Instead of focusing on size, Sony chose to put the specs first, take it from there and see how compact it can get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The result may not be as small and portable as the Galaxy S4 mini, but unlike that one, the Xperia ZR is a proper flagship. It not only matches the Xperia Z on most aspects, but it even scores several crucial victories that may as well make it the most desirable Sony smartphone at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lower resolution screen makes it the better performer despite the identical chipset, the water protection is taken to the next level and the battery is not only longer-lasting, but also user-removable. If it wasn't for the sexy glass finish, that makes the Xperia Z the better looker, this would be one-way traffic all the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, yes, the display has been downgraded to 720p, but at this size the difference is so hard to spot that you are better off saving precious GPU resources and battery juice than playing by the numbers. We didn't particularly miss the 2MP front-facing camera either, as most video-chat software doesn't support particularly high-quality video anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So for anyone not too obsessed with looks or video watching it's easy to recommend the Xperia ZR over its premium sibling. You'd be getting a more flexible device, while saving yourself a few bucks to spend on a larger microSD card. A 4.55" screen is not as nice for enjoying movies on the go as a five-incher, but it's still pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting, if rather exotic, alternative to the Sony Xperia ZR is the LG Optimus GJ. The waterproof version of the Korean company's soon-to-be-ex flagship is a tad larger than the Sony smartphone, but packs the same processing punch and has a screen with better viewing angles. It only has IPX7 protection though and isn't the easiest handset to find this side of the Urals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus GJ E975W</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Assuming water-protection is what brought you to the Xperia ZR, Samsung has a couple of devices you might want to check out. The Galaxy S4 Active is way larger though and it will cost you more than the Sony smartphone, while the Xcover 2 can't hold a candle to its screen quality or processing prowess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9295 Galaxy S4 Active ? Samsung S7710 Galaxy Xcover 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if it's the flagship experience in a more compact package that you are after, you might want to give the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini and the HTC One mini a try. Those two are certainly smaller than the Xperia ZR, but even if they look and act the flagship part, they don't have the internals to back it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9190 Galaxy S4 mini ? HTC One mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final two devices that might give the Xperia ZR a run for its money are the LG Optimus G and its Googlified Nexus 4 version. Packing the same chipset as the Sony and offering 4.7" screens of the same resolution, those two lack both water protection and memory expansion options. They do have the advantage of being significantly cheaper though, so they might attract bargain-hunters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Nexus 4 E960 ? LG Optimus G E975</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So at the end of the day, the Sony Xperia ZR remains the most compact Android smartphone to deliver the full flagship experience. And as if that's not a great place to be already, the IP58 certification, the microSD card slot and the user-removable battery take it another step forward. With Sony already committed to updating it at least through Android 4.3, it's really one of the easiest smartphones to recommend.</paragraph>
