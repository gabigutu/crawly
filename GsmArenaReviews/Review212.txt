			<paragraph>Someone at Samsung must be really fond of the Soul design and, honestly, we can see why. How we feel about it is not the point though. The Soul looks are spilling down the company portfolio, like it or not. The latest incarnation - Samsung S7330 - packs in stylish exterior, well-rounded feature set and a moderate price tag. And what sounds like a good recipe already is spiced up by the yet exotic touchpad. No news so far, but knowing what to expect can actually turn hard on the S7330. Users will feel entitled to more than passable performance, so let's see if it delivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S7330 may as well be noteworthy for marking a shift in the Samsung naming patterns. It is the first model by the South Korean manufacturer with a four-digit model designation (the rugged B2700, M3510 Beat and 8510 INNOV8 follow suit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making the best of a successful design is a legitimate behavior. The Soul looks are worth continuing but too much copycat might easily result in less focused products. We, for one, had a hard time identifying some certain and immediate competition for the S7330. Of course, that doesn't mean an alternative is nowhere in sight. If you're after 3G (not necessarily HSDPA), same screen size and similar imaging capabilities, you'll be looking at quite a range of options. And sometimes, there'll be extra stuff at the same or even lower price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we start exploring the options, Samsung U900 Soul is the definitive alternative if you aren't tight on cash. The more lavish version of S7330 carries a 5 megapixel camera, and the same touchpad. Having reviewed the U900 ourselves, we can confirm that its camera is one of the best there is on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have two similarly-priced handsets to offer. The Sony Ericsson K850 is older but a classic, and a Cybershot after all - while the rugged C702 is a fresh addition with some interesting extra features. They both pack decent cameras and their screens are as large as the one in Samsung S7330. In addition, their interface seems to be more user-friendly and fluid. You can still get used to both, so it's mostly a matter of personal taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia offerings in this class also seem quite tempting. The already released Nokia 5610 is a music slider, while the 6600 comes in two flavors - slide and fold. They all look pretty stylish and, much like the two Sony Ericsson handsets, have comparable feature packs to Samsung S7330.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Definitely cheaper but exciting enough in terms of design and interface, LG KF600 is also worth having a look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7330 is clearly in for quite a challenge. The price tag will be decisive here, and we can't ignore the fact that at 300 US dollars price point users can go for a juicier spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it's more than obvious that the slick Soul exterior is a strong enough selling point. We're back exploring it after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S7330 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7330 measures 104.8 x 49.4 x 13.9 mm, which is about the same as U900 Soul. It's not a small, let alone ultra thin, slider but it would feel nice in most pockets. The weight of 110g may be on the heavier side for a feature phone but the S7330 has a solid feel and comfortable handling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of Samsung S7330 is obviously inspired by the U900 Soul. Not only the touchpad and the controls around it, but almost every element is located in the same place as in the highborn Soul slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The better part of the front panel is taken by the 2.2" display and the touch-sensitive control pad. On either side on the touchpad there are two rocker-styled regular press keys: soft keys on top, Call and End keys beneath. Above the display we find a video-call camera and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are also pleased with the touch pad but the combination with the controls surrounding it isn't the best. The four keys aren't the most comfortable around and that makes the transition between them and the touch-pad rather hard. On the positive side the sensitivity of the touch pad can be set to one of the three available levels. The vibration feedback strength can also be adjusted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right of S7330 we find the camera key and the microSD slot. The latter is hidden under a small plastic lid. The dual action shutter key is quite small but tactile enough and comfortably placed for landscape shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lanyard eyelet is on the left side and so is the volume rocker. Here we also find the USB port, which is also used for connecting a headset or a charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and the bottom of Samsung S7330 are completely plain with no functional elements whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The neat back panel is a replica of the D780 Duos design. There are two distinct parts: the smooth battery cover with brushed metal looks and the grooved black surface at the bottom. Opening the slider reveals the 3 megapixel camera lens. It's complete with a LED flash and self-portrait mirror. We are to discuss its performance in detail later on in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the battery cover (as easy as a simple slide up) reveals the 880 mAh battery. It is quoted at 350 hours of stand-by and 7 hours of talk-time which are pretty good numbers. In reality, we got the quite pleasing four to five days of moderate usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7330 build quality is more than decent. The metal battery cover is the only special material on the casing; all the other parts are made of plastic. It obviously lacks some Soul sophistication but that's duly reflected in the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset design is a pleasing fusion of Soul elegance and D780 Duos subdued styling. The brushed graphite casing is quite solid and the slider action is smooth and steady. Our only grudge here is that when sliding up and down you can't help but put a thumb on the screen. With the touchpad below you risk launching an unneeded menu when all you want to do is slide up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset feels nice in the hand and is generally easy to operate single-handedly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7330 packs a 2.2" 262K-color display of QVGA resolution. While this sounds pretty much standard for the company there is a significant upgrade here. Sunlight legibility is obviously improved, making the phone comfortable to operate even on the brightest of days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Poor sunlight legibility has been plaguing Samsung handsets for ages and we are glad that steps are taken to deal with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the display also has adjustable brightness levels and very good picture quality. Contrast is crisp as usual and the image can hardly be accused of lacking vibrancy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flat keypad has room for improvement<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Samsung S7330 left us with mixed feelings. The keys that are revealed, once you slide the phone open, might seem large enough, but the combination of wide columns and narrow rows isn't the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the U900 Soul, there are now etched borders between keys but that's more of a visual thing than an actual boost to tactility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metallic ridges that went from side to side on the Soul keypad are now demoted to useless design accents. The top row of keys enjoys sufficient headroom and the Phonebook key, C key and Organizer shortcut are easy to reach and use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom row however is kind of sunk beneath the ornamental frame of the keypad bed and thus hard to access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing a key is marked by a distinct click and that's a point in favor of the flatbed keypad. The backlighting is strong and even.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great at making calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls with Samsung S7330 Soul is generally trouble-free. Voice quality is good enough on both ends of the line and we had no trouble with the handset at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Usual Samsung, the S7330 has a number of dialing animations to choose from - most of them rather childish but still amuzing. In this particular case the options are: Quill pen, Sticky note, two named "Normal", Living world and Theme. The last two vary a little according to the currently selected theme or your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart dialing feature (called Search as spelling by Samsung) can assist dialing by looking up automatically once you start dialing. When you dial in some digits, the handset fetches not only the contacts who have phone numbers containing those, but also contacts whose names match the keypad input (much like T9 but for dialing). Effectively, that means that you may never need to dig in your contacts list to find a contact to dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did our traditional speakerphone test with the Samsung S7330 to complete the telephony-related part of the review. Here is how it ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured recently. It pulls off a very good level, ranking well in the top half of the table. You can find more info on the test itself and the other tested handsets here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface is well familiar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of Samsung S7330 is a copy of the one we saw in its elder brother - the U900 Soul. It allows a good level of customization and some eye-candy and that's pretty much that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lately the feature phones of most majors are getting more and more alike in terms of UI. Sony Ericsson are to be noted here as their phones have almost full multitasking and Nokia stand out with their active standby screen. It might be time Samsung did something to be remembered by too. The Living world (formerly uGo) background does count for something here but isn't really making that much of a difference if you don't travel that much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S7330 has a menu structure typical for the company handsets. There are also some nice transition effects when switching screens. The speed and responsiveness are praiseworthy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is accessible from the standby display by pressing the left soft key. The right soft key is reserved for the phonebook. As far as the four directions of the touchpad are concerned, those can be modified to best suit the user needs. The confirmation center of the touchpad launches a grid of shortcuts, within which you can assign 12 of you favorite applications for quicker access. That's the most notable difference from the U900 Soul, where the center of the touchpad launched the main menu - quite pointless, with the left soft key doing the very same thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby display of the S7330 offers the usual layout - the top bar is reserved for standard readings like signal strength, battery status, network connectivity, ringing profile etc. The bottom bar features description of the functions assigned to the soft keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dynamic traveler background (formerly uGo) is also present on the Samsung S7330. It sets the background image according to the country where the phone is being used. The final option for the wallpaper is a slideshow - you can select a number of photos to alternate with a preset transition effect on the standby screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu offers the most popular alignments - either a 3 x 4 grid of icons or a standard list. All sub-menus appear as lists.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization two ways<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having an extra screen to customize (the touchpad), the Samsung S7330 is sure able to change its looks more than most other phones out there. In addition to the wide variety of standby screens, the S7330 can have its whole theme altered. There are three preinstalled themes on the handset and there is also a theme creator to help you put together a theme of your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchpad has two color schemes. The desktop clock also has three different styles. All in all, the S7330 will hardly ever leave you bored. Had Samsung made the menu font size customizable we would've given it an excellent mark. At this point, a minus will have to do.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook - old but gold<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Up to 1000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. The S7330 phonebook displays the names from the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name. You can also use the Smart dialing feature (called Search as Spelling by Samsung) we mentioned earlier. Unluckily, searching a contact by last name is unavailable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different information fields are available for each contact. For example you can store up to 5 numbers, 4 email addresses, URLs and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone (music or video) and a picture, as well as a note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be organized into groups, which can then have their own ringtones and pictures. There is also a birthday field, which can easily be exported to the calendar. This is still probably the most convenient solution we have seen. An individual contact details or your whole contacts list can be sent via Bluetooth. You can also save namecards to your memory card if you want to transfer them that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call logging application can be accessed from either the Call key in stand-by or the call log icon in the main menu. The app itself has four tabs - recent contacts, dialed numbers, received and missed calls. There are also data and call time counters and even a call cost feature if you provide information about your subscription plan.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7330 has no problem handling any of the common types of messages: SMS, EMS, MMS, and email. The first three share an editor while the emails have one of their own. You can covert your SMS to EMS by adding formatting for example, while inserting an image or other multimedia content instantly turns it into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A rich T9 dictionary is at the user's disposal too. In case message sending fails, the message is automatically saved to the outbox, so you can try resending it later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is room for 500 SMS in the phone memory. As far as emails and MMS are concerned, they are not limited in number and storage depends on the free memory only. There are about 31 MB available, which should be enough if you keep most of your other stuff on the memory card. Incoming messages, and calls for that matter, can be blocked based on a user-defined black list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is very good. It can manage up to five POP or IMAP accounts. Email download is configurable, the options being headers only and entire messages. SSL protocol is also supported so you can bet there is no problem setting up an account that requires it (Gmail comes to mind).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The client can be set up to check mail at a chosen interval (options vary from 30 minutes to 1 day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, Samsung S7330 provides very decent messaging experience thanks to its good software support. We already shared our concerns with the keypad ergonomics. However most users will still be just fine with the S7330 messaging capabilities. After all a few seconds more to send a message isn't much of a pain, is it?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since the Samsung U900 Soul, the file browsers of the company handsets have been greatly improved. Therefore the fact that the S7330 uses the exact same application is good news for us. It lists all the folders from both the phone memory and the memory card together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. However, misplaced files are still handled problem-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the file browser is one of the best among non-smartphones. You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (save for the basic ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth one by one or multiple at once. Throughout the whole file manager, you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion. The whole file navigation thingy is really quick with no lags whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only if you insert a really large memory card and fill it with countless small files are you likely to get the S7330 to slow down. Listing thumbnails of the pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card also happens very quickly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Picture gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The picture gallery of the S7330 is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. This isn't necessarily a fault, as launching it is still as simple as opening a folder that contains images. You can copy or move images to any folder of your liking, unlike some older Samsung handsets where only the Images folder was available for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures are displayed as a list with small thumbnail next to each filename. Sorting can be done by date, type, name, and size. Once you open a picture to view, you can scroll sideways to see the next images without having to return to the image list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures are normally viewed in portrait mode, but when fullscreen is applied the screen switches to landscape. Setting full-screen view is as simple as a simple tap on the touchpad confirmation centre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can also zoom in on a picture to see greater detail though we must warn you that zooming in and out is quite slow and irritating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S73300 has ShoZu integration, meaning you can upload images directly to ShoZu straight from the Image gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can also edit your pictures using the integrated Image Editor - it's one of the most capable image editing applications for mobile phones. It allows you to apply a whole bunch of effects and adjustments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Transformations and crops, as well as insertion of various items, are also available. All in all, the Samsung S7330 offers you virtually all of the most popular editing capabilities you could possibly use on a cell phone. We really doubt it though that anyone is serious about editing images on a cell phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music in your pocket<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7330 has the typical feature phone music player with nice looks and decent functionality. The list of exciting goodies isn't too long but we are happy with it as it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music player application allows filtering tracks by author, album, genre and composers. You can also choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to, or the ones that you've played the most. Custom playlists can be created too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with the U900, the S7330 music player has no equalizer presets, but sound effects instead. The difference is that the sound effects also include wide and surround options in addition to the six available presets. There are also three types of visualization and you can enable fading out on stop if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background. It can then be controlled with the touchpad straight on your stand-by screen. Pressing the End key closes the application.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio comes with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7330 also comes complete with an FM radio, which is doing quite well in terms of user interface. It has the self-tune option to store all stations of clear reception at the moment. There is also RDS that can be switched on and off depending on your taste.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player likes touchpad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is one of the phone features that makes best use of the touchpad navigation. All the controls are always at hand with no need of irritating text over your video. Controlling the video player with the touchpad covers all essential features, including fast forwarding and rewinding, and these are easily accessed without going through menus. In addition, you can enjoy the videos fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder works in MPEG-4 format, so there is no doubt the player supports it. That makes converting your favorite clips and movies to watch on your Samsung S7330 much easier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is pleasing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung sure know how to produce handsets with good quality audio output. The S7330 is quite a decent musician, though somewhat short of the best we have seen. All of its readings are good with no disturbing issues to note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our only concern is the frequency response graph, which suggests a kind of high-pass filter enabled to restrict sounds below 100 Hz. Once again this is nothing to be too worried about and something you are unlikely to catch with your bare ear, unless you are one of them crazy audiophiles.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7330 carries a 3 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. While not a top-of-the-line cameraphone, the S7330 performed rather well in the photography field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface very much resembles that of the good old Samsung G800. The four shortcuts that are assigned to the touch pad do help here but the result is still not the most user friendly. However, the available settings are quite a lot so we are willing to accept the somewhat complicated menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the more important settings are picture size, shooting mode (single shot, multi-shot, mosaic, and frame), effects (black and white, sepia, negative etc.) and 3 white balance presets. The additional camera settings include contrast, saturation, sharpness, exposure metering, picture quality and auto focus settings. Exposure metering is also configurable and auto focus can be switched off if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of Samsung S7330 is rather good. The image processing algorithm is decent though noise reduction is a bit too aggressive and eradicates fine detail. On some of the pictures the contrast isn't great either but neither of those is too bad. On the other hand, the low noise levels and the precise colors are welcome benefits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here come the sample photos so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recoding is concerned, Samsung S7330 totally disappointed us. The highest resolution available is QCIF and this is only good for MMS. Anyway, miracles were not to be expected, as even the U900 Soul only managed QVGA video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-rounded connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Samsung S7330 you can count on 3G with HSDPA support and GPRS for browsing internet on the go. There is also EDGE which is essential for browsing in areas where 3G coverage is missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the network data transfers, Samsung S7330 also supports USB and Bluetooth, both version 2.0. A2DP support is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone works without a glitch when transferring data to and from PC. The USB connection has PC Studio, Media player and Mass storage modes. Each of them can be set as default or otherwise the user will be prompted for action upon connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser limited in features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our hopes for the S7330 web browser weren't too high, given our disappointment with the high-end Soul. You get a NetFront 3.4 web browser, which is capable enough, but its capabilities were seriously trimmed down in the S7330.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no landscape view mode and the page resize feature doesn't work that well. When reducing the size, the font isn't handled properly and any text on the screen becomes compressed to being downright illegible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also no trace of the mouse pointer we've been seeing in some of the recent Samsung and Sony Ericsson handsets, that use the same version of the NetFront web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, pages are rendered well in both desktop and Smart-fit view mode. However, as mentioned, this only holds true if you are using the default page size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S7330 features a dedicated shortcut to organizer apps on its alphanumeric keypad. The calendar and alarms have their own slots in the main menu too. The S7330 calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are five types of events available for setting up: appointment, anniversary, holiday, important and private. Each of those has its own unique fields and an alarm to remind of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can store up to 100 appointments, 50 anniversaries, 50 holidays, 20 important and 20 private events. Much like with previous Samsung handsets, you can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the available applications you will find a Google package which gives you direct access to Google Search and Gmail. There is also an RSS feed reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five alarm slots available on the Samsung S7330 and additional ones can be created if needed. Each of them can have its own snooze time, number of repetitions and activation days. The volume can also be different for each alarm and all but one of them (Wake-up) can be renamed to the user liking. Furthermore, you can set different tones for each of the alarms and you can choose whether it should trigger phone vibration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other offerings are the voice memo recorder, a world clock application, a calculator, and a unit convertor. A countdown timer and a stopwatch are also aboard. There is a handy to-do manager too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final application worth mentioning in Samsung S7330 is the integrated document viewer. It supports viewing MS Word, MS Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files and handles them all pretty well. The speed of zooming and panning is quite quick and there is also fullscreen mode available. There's no document editing, not in this price range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gaming department of Samsung S7330 is merely the launch pad to Samsung Fun Corner. All the offered titles are trials, full versions unlockable for an extra fee. Mobile content sales are the cash cow, like it or not.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>That's that on the down-market Soul, which does have the good and the bad of the original. The S7330 is in a lower price bracket than the U900 Soul but packs the same UI goodies, which is an achievement. However the low-key exterior shows its modest roots. Samsung S7330 is trimmed down in terms of imaging, but the trade-off is quad-band network support. The touchpad is the S7330 defining feature, but it just isn't everyone's cup of tea.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we might as well be too picky here and the reason probably is the high bar set by the Soul. The S7330 was only very recently released and price has nowhere to go but down. And that may be the right push for Samsung S7330 to start climbing that lower league it's playing in.</paragraph>
