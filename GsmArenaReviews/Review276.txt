			<subsectionTitle>Hands-on with the Readius mobile phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We think it's time we pay due respect to smaller brands. They quite deserve it for offering some exciting devices, which are sometimes capable enough to stand up to the big fish in the pond. First off, it's the Readius fold-away e-book, the iRiver GSM phone, the Garmin Nuvifone, Toshiba and their Widows devices, a Texas Instruments Android prototype, and others to follow really soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Polymer Vision announced the Readius mobile phone a few weeks back. The Raedius has a display as large as two business cards. In other words, the Dutch company has managed to squeeze a screen with twice the surface area of Apple iPhone in a device not much larger than most mobiles around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Readius secret is that it has a rollable display. You roll it out, read your email, and then roll it back again. Screen legibility is awesome and bright daylight won't hurt it either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display uses the electric ink technology and thus brings amazing power saving capabilities. Once a certain screen is displayed no more energy is needed to display it until the image changes. The other most obvious effect is that the fold-away form factor makes a color screen implausible. Instead, the 5" QVGA display is a 16-grayscale unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you roll the screen up, it becomes a pretty compact device that can amazingly fit into any pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the sound of it, Polymer Vision will be challenging the Amazon's Kindle e-book reader, since the grayscale display will not do for watching videos or browsing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Readius mobile phone comes with UMTS/HSDPA connectivity for downloading all the content you might want to read - including your emails and messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other connectivity options of the Readius include USB v2.0 and Bluetooth v2.0. There is also a built-in microSD slot with support for high capacity memory cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Readius mobile phone is powered by a 400MHz ARM processor and has only 8 hardware keys that are used for all its features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the phone dialling funtion of the Readius is rather limited. You are confined to using your Outlook-synced contacts - dialling a phone in numeric mode is not posible as there is no keypad of any sort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Readius is expected to set foot in stores worldwide in mid-2008 with the company currently set to conclude some high-profile contracts. Price is not yet known, but should be in the vicinity of high-end mobile phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hands-on with iriver GSM phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Multimedia player manufacturers iriver are downright committed to a corner on the GSM mobile phone market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After a controversial (and shortlived!) appearance at CES 2008 with an almost-clone of Apple's iPhone, the iriver GSM phone is back at the MWC 2008, this time with an entirely different user interface. What hasn't changed though is the large 3" touchscreen display that looks like a nice portal to all your multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iriver GSM phone was presented at the MWC 2008 along with another device - the Wi-Fi-enabled VoIP-centric iriver W7. The black W7 looks exactly the same as the iriver GSM phone but has a more elaborate user interface and can even dial numbers (something the GSM phone can't pull off at the moment).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the time being, the iriver GSM phone (the white one) is not complete and the user interface still needs to be updated. However, it is believed to have the same interface as the iriver W7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting detail is that the iriver W7, being a Wi-Fi/VoIP solution, comes in two versions - one with and another one without a GPS receiver. For the non-GPS enabled devices, including the GSM phone, iriver are offering a desk or car dashboard cradle with integrated GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iriver W7 will be available at the end of Q3 2008, while the iriver GSM phone should hit the markets in the beginning of Q4 2008 - both in white and black.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Garmin Nuvifone hands-on (sort of!)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just a few weeks ago, the leading nav-solution manufacturer Garmin announced entering the mobile phone business with their spanking new Garmin Nuvifone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Relying solely on touch for the handling, the Garmin Nuvifone promised a bunch of nice features. The main focus is of course the built-in GPS and GPS navigation software. Besides, it also pitched 3G with HSDPA and a camera with video recording capabilities and geo-tagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just days ago we came across the following Nuvifone promo and we were so over ourselves when we finally found time to call in at the Garmin stand at the WMC 2008 in Barcelona.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Garmin booth at the Fira de Barcelona however brought us only disappointment. They didn't have an actual working device for us to mess with. Instead, we were presented with a Nuvifone dummy that showed two screens - one with the interface, and another of the navigation software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, we decided to shoot the darn dummy, so you could share our disappointment. Maybe next time Garmin, right?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Modu - the transformer mobile phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finding our way around the Fira de Barcelona on the third day of the Mobile World Congress, we were desperate for a cheer-up after the ill-fated stopover at the Garmin stand. You may start to sniff the dramatic twist, but we doubt it you're even halfway prepared for what may as well be the pleasant surprise of this year's WMC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Imagine a device with many faces that puts Transformers in its pocket. It gets into business mood during the day, while it keeps a low profile during evening outings. One day it's a gaming platform with a large display, the next day it becomes your music player with pocketable body and optimized music controls. And as time passes by it gets even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, meet Modu. Modu is a true modular device - with a tiny beating heart at the centre of it all. It's the smallest mobile phone in the world, but it's not about dimensions we are talking here. Yet, it's true that great things come in small packages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This particular package consists of the Modu mobile phone and a variety of "jackets" to pick from. What you actually do is put the Modu in the jacket you need and it changes its functionality head-to-toe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so called jackets are shells that can alter every single aspect of the phone. From display size and available memory to battery power and software functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Confused? Don't be! With Modo should you need good music listening experience, all you need to do is put the Boom Box jacket on. It provides stereo speakers, nice intuitive audio player interface and so on. If you are in for a game - just change to the game jacket and you get a powerful large screen gaming console in your hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an idea of a Tourist jacket for example - you just buy yourself the Barcelona jacket and it will have all the information you may need when traveling to Spain's second largest city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's also an idea of a Storage device jacket that adds a male USB port to the Modu so you can plug it straight in the computer, no cables needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's even better is that the device is already working and it's got a few spare jackets in the closet. More are expected in the near future. The Modu can also be used without a jacket and then it's just a regular phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A regular phone that has quad-band GSM/GPRS network support and 1GB of storage memory that is (expandable to up to 32GB). When used on its own, the Modu also has MP3 player functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To say that we are impressed would be understated but the expected retail price makes things even better. The device is initially planned to be launched through carriers at an estimated price of only EUR 200 before taxes and subsides. It is expected to ship with two jackets prebundled. Other jackets will be available as well, at about EUR 20 to 60.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the good news doesn't end here. The Modu manufacturer is planning deals for the production of Modu mates - those would be standalone consumer gadgets that make the best out of Modu's modularity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An already agreed option is a car audio system by Bosch/Blaupunkt that accepts the Modu as a storage device and play tracks straight from it. The company is also developing a GPS navigation mate in cooperation with Magellan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an option of a digital picture frame that shows the images from your Modu, but also visualizes your text messages and you can use it to make and receive calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another mate projects is a DECT phone - you come home, you plug your Modu in your home DECT phone and you have all your contacts right there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A deal has also been signed with Universal Music that will probably make room for a lot of music-styled jackets themed by artist, genre, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll keep a close eye on this exciting thingy and let you stay on top of the latest about it. Next thing on our mind is a full-blown test drive. Hope we can pull that one off and see if it's that Jacket-of-all trades. For what we've seen so far, there is enough to be looking forward to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the meantime, enjoy this Modu commercial video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Texas Instruments and the Android prototype<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Texas Instruments had a pleasant surprise in store for us with two working prototypes running the Google's Android platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is a touchscreen device. It doesn't have the looks to take with you on the next party but surely it would come in handy if you are an aspiring programmer looking to contribute to Google's mobile venture called Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Texas Instruments are in fact going to sell their device to programmers at a reasonable price, so they can use it as a testing platform for their program code.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>

</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smaller non-touchscreen device is just a proof of concept that you may as well have seen on many online or live presentations. Both devices run on Texas Instruments chips - and surprisingly smooth for that matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you've missed a demo, enjoy our home-brewed videos. Cheers!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hands-on the Toshiba Portege series<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Toshiba stand at the Mobile World Congress was the next stop in our window-shopping tour. A few new devices were on display and they looked promising, at least on paper. So, we lingered at the Toshiba booth to give you a basic idea of what the devices look like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba Portege G910/G920<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Toshiba G910/G920 Portege is the most feature-loaded device showcased at the booth. It sports a full QWERTY keyboard and a whole bunch of other high-end features. You've got Wi-Fi, GPS, a powerful processor and a whole lot of RAM. Only the camera (2 megapixel unit) can be a little disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the camera is close to useless, since you need to open the device to use the internal screen as a viewfinder. In that scenario however, the camera lens ends up right under your fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Toshiba G910 Portege is quite a heavy bloke and, therefore, not the easiest to work with. However, it does make up for that with a large display of WVGA resolution that we found splendid for web browsing for example. The QWERTY keyboard is also a joy to use, with large enough keys to make typing quite pleasant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device is also quick enough and that makes navigation through the menus a much better experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba Portege G810<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Toshiba G810 Portege is a touchscreen device with touch-sensitive keys below the display. It has enough processing power and features, but navigation could've been a lot better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found working with the touch-sensitive keys quite a challenge, as they weren't as responsive as we would've liked. Still, this is by far not the final version of the phone, so it is likely to improve before hitting the shelves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba Portege G710<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next comes the Toshiba G710 Portege, which is again a Windows Mobile-powered device. This time however the standard edition is used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Less powerful than the G910, the Toshiba G710 Portege wasn't as pleasing to work with. It felt rather bulky in the hand too, so it doesn't win many points on size either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Toshiba Portege G450<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Toshiba Portege G450 is a 4-in-1 portable device. It's a portable HSDPA USB modem, a diminutive mobile phone, a USB data storage device and an MP3 player - all that weighing 57 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Toshiba G450 connects through a USB cable to your computer providing you with a broadband connection. You can even make calls on the device while you are surfing the Web through your carrier's GPRS/EDGE/UMTS/HSDPA wireless network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got an OLED display with a resolution of 96 x 39 pixels, which couldn't get us rolling. As a mobile phone, the Toshiba Portege G450 doesn't have any fancy features too - the only additional feature beside the music player is the Alarm clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting around the interface is easy once you get used to the controls. You use the two side rocker keys for that purpose. The right rocker allows you to select items and then go one level up in the menu. The left rocker is used for scrolling through the menu lists. Entering text or numbers proved harder due to the unusual keypad layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With 160MB of built-in storage chances are you won't probably be throwing away your music player just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that Toshiba are committed to producing another device in this form factor in Q2 2008 but this time with a built-in microSD slot for expanding the onboard memory.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hands-on with i-mate Ultimate phones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The i-mate Booth at the MWC 2008 has pretty reserved looks. There were no fresh phones announced, but some of i-mate's top-end communicators were on display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>i-mate Ultimate 9502 and 8502 come with Wi-Fi, built-in GPS receiver, Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP support, TV/Audio output slot and QWERTY hardware keyboard. The network support is really "Ultimate", including tri-band HSDPA/HSUPA and quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE. I-mate Ultimate 8502 and 9502 are running on Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.0 Professional and rely on the Qualcomm MSM 7200 400 MHz processor for their calculation needs (seen on the HTC TyTN II). The devices are armed with 256 MB ROM and 128 MB RAM, as well as a microSD card slot. Regrettably both devices have a 2.5mm earphone jack instead of a 3.5mm one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>i-mate Ultimate 9502</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I-mate Ultimate 9502 looks like a normal PocketPC phone - until you slide the display to reveal the full QWERTY keyboard beneath. The display itself is large 256K-color TFT touchscreen with VGA resolution. Other than that, a 3.2 MP autofocus camera and support for the same business applications as in I-mate 8502 are at your disposal. The large QWERTY keyboard and sliding VGA screen come at a cost - the device weighs a good 200g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our first impressions of i-mate Ultimate 9502 are that it's quite a smoothly running gadget with good response. Display rotation, when you open the slider however, is quite sluggish though, and that can really get annoying if used too frequently. Otherwise, the VGA screen is the breath of fresh air about this device. The QWERTY keypad is also large enough and comfortable to use. On the other hand, we can?t help the feeling that a TyTN-like design would've given even more space for the keys. Nonetheless, i-mate Ultimate 9502 did seem a nice device overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>i-mate Ultimate 8502</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I-mate Ultimate 8502 has a 256K-color TFT touchscreen display with QVGA resolution and a 2 MP camera with LED flash. The business functionality is quite extensive, with Push Email and support for Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, PowerPoint Mobile and ClearVue PDF viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The i-mate Ultimate 8502 won our appreciation with the design of its keyboard. The angular keys are really nice looking. Their usability is not as good but that can be explained with the size of the device itself. They are still good enough, unless you are going to type volumes on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>i-mate Ultimate 8150 and 6150</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other phones cought live in Barcelona 2008 are the well known i-mate Ultimate 8150 and i-mate Ultimate 6150. Not much to tell here, as they are pretty well-known to anyone interested in Windows Mobile devices.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hands-on with Gigabyte MS804 and MW998<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At the WMC in Barcelona Gigabyte conjured up MS804 and MW998. The two unexpected newcomers replaced without notice the Gigabyte GSmart MW700 and MS800, which were officially supposed to feature in Barcelona. Anyway, the new devices are hi-end PocketPC's running on Windows Mobile 6 Professional. The unique thing about both devices is the user-configurable CPU mode with Powersaving, Standard and Performance the available otions. The latter probably manages idle programs or those running in the background, as well as the data cash.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gigabyte MS804<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first debut is Gigabyte MS804, a tri-band GSM/EDGE phone with UMTS/HSDPA support. Unique to PocketPC, it is notable for the slider form factor revealing a standard phone keypad. MS804 sports an ample 2.6" 256K-color TFT touchscreen of QVGA resolution. It runs on the potent Marvel PXA270 520MHz processor, utilizing 256MB of ROM and 64MB RAM. Gigabyte MS804 has a 2 megapixel autofocus camera and a secondary video-call unit. An MP3 player and stereo FM radio with RDS are also in the package. Gigabyte MS804 measures 18.2mm in thickness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gigabyte MW998<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The other newcomer is Gigabyte MW998, a quad-band GSM/GPRS PocketPC, which has HSDPA sacrificed in favor of a 2.6" 256K-color touchscreen display of VGA resolution. The other specs are pretty much on par with MS804. We have the same processor, RAM and ROM capacity. It also brings an MP3 player and a two megapixel snapper, but lacks FM radio. Gigabyte MW998 keeps up with the MS804 dimensions, at 18.5mm thick.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hands-on with Eten M810 and V900<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We wrap it up with Eten and a couple of their hi-end offerings at the MWC in Barcelona. Eten Glofiish V900 features an onboard digital TV tuner, while the Glofiish M810 is full-QWERTY PocketPC. Both Windows Mobile 6 Pro devices were leaked earlier this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eten Glofiish V900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The highlight of Glofiish V900 is mobile TV. Eten's PocketPC supports the DVB-H, DVB-T, TDMB and DAB broadcasting standards. The Glofiish V900 also flaunts a VGA display along with HSDPA, Wi-Fi, and GPS. The device will also feature the brand new Eten touch interface - following a welcome tendency of home-brewed facelifts to the standard Windows Mobile UI. The Eten Glofiish V900 will be launched in the second half of 2008.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eten Glofiish M810</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eten Glofiish M810 comes to succeed the Eten M800 and brings a decent load of welcome goodies - hardware QWERTY keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth v2.0 with EDR, GPS chip (SiRF Star III), 2 megapixel autofocus camera with macro mode and secondary 0.3MP videocall camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eten M810 offers world wide connectivity with quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA support. The phone has a large 2.8" TFT QVGA display - so much for the rumored VGA, which we had back in M800. It runs on the powerful Samsung SC3 2442 500MHz processor, utilizing 256MB of Flash ROM and 64MB SDRAM. The user available memory is microSD expandable. The device is powered by an average Li-Ion battery of 1530 mAh capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official dimensions of Eten Glofiish M810 are 109.5 x 59 x 17.5 mm, at 179 g.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Alcatel presented a handful of new low to mid-end phones at WMC in Barcelona. The now China-based company steers clear of the high-end segment and the industry top dogs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-S218</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-S218 is a dual-band low-end bar with a 1.8" 65K-color STN display with a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels. Except for the regular phone functionality, it has an FM radio with RDS and Bluetooth. The onboard memory counts the meager 2MB and there is no card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-S319</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-S319 is an entry level flip-up phone. It has a 1.8" 65K-color STN display with a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels, 512KB built-in memory, and no extra applications. The dual-band phone even lacks Bluetooth and infrared.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-S520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bar-shaped dual-band Alcatel OT-S520 features the same 1.8" 65K-color STN display with a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels. No bluetooth and a card slot here either, but there's a VGA camera and 2MB of built-in memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-S621</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-S621 looks suspiciously familiar to its younger brother S520 but carries much more functionality. The dual-band phone impresses with its 10.9mm slimness and 69g weight. On top of the same 1.8" 65K-color STN display of 128 x 160 resolution, OT-S621 offers a 1.3 megapixel camera, 10MB of built-in memory and microSD card slot, as well as Bluetooth with A2DP support. The final extra is the MP3 player with dedicated hardware keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-S920</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-S920 is another lower mid-range phone sporting a 256K-color TFT display with a 176 x 220 pixel resolution. The other goodies include a 1.3 megapixel camera, MP3 player, Bluetooth v1.2 with A2DP, 8MB of on-board memory and a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Mandarina Duck</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Mandarina Duck is a flip-up phone for the young. It has a VGA camera with webcam functionality, MP3/MPEG-4 player, 10MB of memory and a slot for microSD cards, Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP profile and 128x160 65K-color TFT display. The top of the flip flaunts dedicated music keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-V770</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-V770 is probably the best phone in the pack. It's got the looks and a landscape 1.9" 256K-color TFT display with a 176 x 220 pixels resolution. Among the worthy features of this tri-band handset are MP3 player, 1.3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP, 10MB of built-in memory and slot for microSD cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-V212</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-V212 is a modest low-ender. It has a square 1.5" 65K-color CSTN display with a 128 x 128 pixels resolution. It's pretty short on functions, FM radio the only thing to mention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-Sport</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-Sport is a tri-band handset for the sport minded. It boasts a built-in accelerometer with handy sport functions, such as a pedometer and a calory counter. An accelerometer-based option mutes the alarm when you shake the handset. On top of those upgrades, the phone has an MP3 player, Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP profile, 2MB memory, microSD card slot and a 1.3 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-X020</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel OT-X020 looks like the front panel of a flip-up phone, but actually is a standalone USB 2.0 modem with a SIM card bed. It supports HSDPA 3.6Mbps, UMTS 2100 MHz and tri-band EDGE. It is a plug and play device with auto-installation functionality and one key connect/disconnect option. Its dimensions are 89 x 47 x 11mm at 50g of weight.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>At the WMC in Barcelona, Sagem Mobiles (Safran Group) showcased several new launches amidst some of the company's already available handsets. The bunch makes for a good all-round offering, ranging from modern and stylish to practical gadgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem my721x</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem my721x certainly counts among the style-driven phones with its brushed aluminum body and contemporary looks. Some 12.6mm thin, the newcomer has a 2" 256K-color TFT display. The tri-band phone employs a 3.2 megapixel camera, MP3 player, FM radio with RDS, Bluetooth, and microSD card slot. My721X will be released in April 2008.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem my855c</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem my855c is a flip-up with dedicated MP3-player keys on the front and a bizarre keypad. The tri-band handset bundles up 3G support and a 256K-color TFT display of QVGA resolution. The entertainment sector includes the mentioned MP3 player, FM radio and MPEG-4 player. Bluetooth v2.0 with A2DP profile is also at hand. The phone has 54MB of storage toppped with microSD expansion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem Roland Garros</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other new offering is the Sagem Roland Garros phone for the style-sensitive. Despite its soft white casing and gray keys, we could tell in a glimpse it has the same design as Sagem my511X. The Sagem Roland Garros phone has a 65K-color TFT display with a 128 x 160 pixel resolution. 10.9 mm thickness certainly earns it a "very thin" mark. Functionality is right down the middle - 1.3 megapixel camera, MP3 player, Bluetooth, 13MB of memory, and a microSD slot complete the basic set of functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem my750x</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem my750x is designed to cater to the youth market and shows some bold and creative use of color. The handset is available in violet, green, raspberry red, orange and blue variants. The back of the phone boasts a 'soft-touch' finish, while the speaker is highlighted in sound-wave-like pattern. The front looks good enough too with an intriguing keyboard and comfortable joystick beneath a large 2.4" 65K-color QVGA TFT display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At only 11 mm thin, Sagem my750x is a tri-band phone with dual-band HSDPA/EDGE support. The other specs include a 3.2 megapixel camera, MP3 and MPEG-4 player, FM radio with RDS, Bluetooth, 54MB of built-in memory and microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem my511x</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another mobile that Sagem showcased at the WMC 2008 is the Sagem my511x, which was announced not a long while ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sagem my511x is a 10mm thin handset with beautiful finish and chrome accents. It sports a flatbed keyboard and large D-pad, which turns into music control when the MP3 player is on. The information is displayed on a 1.9" 65K-color TFT display with a 128 x 160 pixel resolution. Other goodies included are the 1.3 megapixel camera, Bluetooth, 32MB on-board memory and a slot for microSD cards.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HP IPAQ 614 Business Navigator was also presented at the Mobile World Congress 2008. Part of the IPAQ 600 family, the HP IPAQ 614 (identical to the IPAQ 610c) comes equipped with a 3 megapixel autofocus camera, GPS receiver and support for almost all of the GSM and UMTS bands available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HP IPAQ 614 has a 2.8" touchscreen display with QVGA display and offers smooth performance thanks to the 520 MHz Marvel PXA270 processor and the 128 MB SDRAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the coolest thing about the IPAQ 614 is the Smart touch navigation wheel - you just put your finger on the touch-sensitive ring you see on the alpha-numeric keypad and you can scroll through the menus, applications and documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device is meant to be easily used by one hand so there is even a Jog Wheel on the left side which is rather nice - we at GSMArena love jog wheels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enjoy our video demonstrating the Smart Touch navigation wheel:</paragraph>
