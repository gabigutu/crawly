			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 3 name is shared between two smartphones that couldn't be any different. Announced during MWC 2015, one is a 5.5-inch behemoth, while the other is a more than pocketable 4.7-inch device. And as luck would have it, we got to review both concurrently, but in different spots in the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices should be available worldwide, but Alcatel will be using the Alcatel Idol 3 to start a proper offensive on the US market. The Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) is the company's boldest entry there to date, aiming to bring style, a rich feature set and value in the upper mid-range segment. It comes with 1080p screen resolution and a Snapdragon 615 chipset. So we got to review this one on US soil.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other one, the The Alcatel Idol (4.7) is the more affordable of the two and it's no surprise it comes with lesser hardware. It's got the same camera as its bigger sibling, but it has a 720p only resolution screen and a Snapdragon 410 chipset. It's the mini in the duo and it's aiming at the lower midrange spectrum of the market. We got to review one in our European HQ.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick glance at the long list of features of both phones shows Alcatel means business with its latest products. With IPS screens, dual speakers, 13MP Sony IMX214 main cameras, and lightly customized Android 5.0.2 Lollipop and sleek exteriors they certainly leave the right impression. Both come with the industry first fully reversible design meaning you can talk on either of them holding it with either way up. Not only the UI, but also the active speaker and mic combo will happily rotate to accommodate your preference even mid-call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite their budget-friendly nature, the Alcatel Idol 3 duo covers all the bases in terms of hardware features - even more so for the bigger phone. The 5.5"1080p IPS display ensures that the handset punches above its weight in this department. The smaller one may have lower pixel density but it's still gorgeous to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo speakers are a particularly welcome feature in the mid-range segment. Coupled with the large and crisp display, they ensure that the Idol 3 will be a highly capable platform for consuming media content and gaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we will kick off our review with unboxing, followed by design and build quality inspection. Head over to the next page for a closer look at the smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both Alcatel Idol 3 smartphones offer a well-appointed retail package. In addition to a charger, microUSB cable, and SIM removal tool, users also get a pair of quality in-ear headphones by JBL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A premium headset is surely a welcome sight in the box for the smartphone. Most rivals in the US don't include the accessory at all, while in other regions the Idol 3 direct competitors usually ship with a generic headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Idol 3 is a nice looking smartphone in the flesh. Thanks to its symmetrical design, It sports a clean, understated look that will appeal to a wide range of potential customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic back of the device features a nice matt finish with brushed effect. A touch of chrome in the frame and the Idol 3 logo on the back add visual flare without being gaudy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can order the device in three different colors. They include light and dark gray, as well as gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Idol 3 is one of the better looking devices in its price range. It is also arguably the best looking Alcatel smartphone to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Physical measures of the Idol 3 (5.5) are 152.7 x 75.1 x 7.4 mm, while its weight tips the scale at 141 grams. The smartphone is on the light side for a 5.5" device, despite packing an ample 2,910 battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock button is located in an uncomfortable position at the upper left corner. Thankfully, you can light up the screen with a double tap on both phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Idol 3 (4.7) measures 134.6 x 65.9 x 7.6 mm, which means the thickness of both devices is practically the same. The smaller one however is much lighter at 110 grams. But of course, a lot of that weight reduction has come at the expense of a significantly smaller battery capacity of only 2000mAh. Our dedicated battery test, which listed further in the review, will give you an approximation of the expected battery life from both devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the display of the Idol 3, you will find the front-facing camera, an ambient light and proximity sensor, as well as on of the stereo speakers. The other stereo speaker sits alone at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left here we also find the LED notification light, which lights up to notify you of any pending notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the smartphone is home to the power/lock key and the tray, which holds the micro-SIM and the microSD card. The volume rocker sits alone on the left side of the Idol 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and a microphone pinhole sit on top of the handset. On the bottom, you will see the microUSB port and another microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having stereo speakers and microphones on both sides allows users to use the Idol 3 for making calls on either side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the smartphone is home to the 13MP camera and its single-LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 3 has a non-removable battery and back cover on both models.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) features a 5.5" FullHD (1920 x 1080 pixels) IPS display. The unit has the same size and 401ppi pixel density as the iPhone 6 Plus. The 4.7" Idol 3 does away with 720p display with 312ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer boasts that the screen comes with dynamic color and contrast adjustment. They are marketing as some Technicolor technology but the truth is only licensing its brand to the smartphone maker and whatever technology they have, it has been developed in-house. The enhancement in this case refers to dynamic boosting of colors and contrast of certain areas of the screen image so that skin tones and faces remain natural looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing is certain, both phones have pretty nice displays for their price ranges and we really like the side viewing angles, the colors and the contrast. Sunlight legibility is quite good on both models.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) packs a 2,910mAh non-removable battery. The unit's capacity similar to that offered by some of the device's rivals in the mid-range segment. We put the Idol 3 (5.5) through the paces of our battery test. It achieved an endurance rating of 67h, which is quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7) has a significantly lower capacity battery of 2,000mAh. The unit propelled the device to an endurance rating of 55h.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regarding the wide gap in talk time, you should bear in mind that the Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) has been tested on a T-Mobile US network (3G mode) far from our usual European test site. This is one potential reason for the huge difference though our experience with other smartphones is that as long as the network signal is good, the choice of network cannot influence the battery life score that much. This should come to point out that, we're most probably looking at a genuine difference in the performance of the two, which can be caused not only by battery capacity but also due to a difference in the modem used by the built-in chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our endurance rating is an approximation of what the battery would theoretically last you if you were to use your phone for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback per day. While usage routines certainly vary, we've adopted this as a basis of our calculations to allow you to compare the real-life battery life of the phones we review. The endurance rating calculation also includes a standby battery draw measurement, which is not shown on the scorecards above.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Idol 3 offers a rich set of connectivity features. The basics include quad-band GSM andÂ&nbsp;UMTS, followed by HSPA+ and Cat. 4 LTE (150Mbps) support. Certain markets also get a Dual SIM model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A slight difference between the two Idol 3 models in the connectivity department means the 5.5-incher had dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n support and Bluetooth 4.1, while the smaller 4.7-incher relies only on single band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that Wi-Fi Direct and Wi-Fi Display are supported by both devices, as well as NFC. Both have GPS receivers too and USB On-The-Go support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only notable lacking features here could be a wired TV-out option, though the significance of its lack will vary depending on your use case.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Idol 3 boots Android 5.0.2 Lollipop out of the box. The Chinese manufacturer has added its own custom skin to the OS, though the overall layout has remained unchanged from stock Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see how the bigger 5.5-inch model feels like in action in the video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer promises that it will support the smartphone with over-the-air updates going forward. There have been no specific commitments to Android builds, though Alcatel will seed updates out "on a rolling basis as needed."</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A double tap on the dark screen will wake up the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a clean layout and a number of app shortcuts. Five of the latter can be customized via a dedicated settings menu, while the ones for telephony and camera sit permanently on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen has a familiar layout. The icons of the Idol 3's native apps are round and colorful - some users might need a bit of time to get used to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps are stored alphabetically into an app drawer. There is no option for custom order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has a stock Lollipop look. It contains shortcuts for commonly used features such as flashlight, Wi-Fi hotspot, and activating the device's reversibility among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app switcher has a neat card interface that allows you to select the app you need by swiping up or down. You can close apps by swiping left or right, or by hitting the dedicated button on the top right corner of each card. Alcatel has also added a button for closing all application at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now can be activated via an upward swipe from the home button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser and other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Idol 3 ships with two web browsers out of the box. They include the once default Android browser and the newer Google Chrome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual array of apps that help you keep your life in order are also on board. You get a clock, a calendar, a calculator, and a note taking app by Alcatel - each with Material Design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel's clock app has a cool-looking animated icon that shows even the seconds. It is a nice design touch by the manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A file manager is also included out of the box. It has a colorful, easy to read interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WPS Office handles editing documents out of the box - it handles all popular formats. You can also opt for the free Google Docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone also ships with a lite version of Facetune. The app allows you to tweak your selfies and typically costs $3.99 in Google Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a compass app included too. NFC tags are handled via a dedicated app, as are system updates, Wi-Fi Display casts, and Wi-Fi transfers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) features Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 MSM8939 chipset with 1.5GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU and quad-core 1GHz Cortex-A53 CPU. The GPU is Adreno 405, while the RAM is 2GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.7" variant of the smartphone features a less capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 MSM8916 SoC. The latter packs 1.2GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU, Adreno 306 GPU, and 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The contacts manager on the Alcatel Idol 3 is a standard Lollipop affair. The app features tabbed interface, which displays all contacts and the favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts including Google and Exchange. A button to add a new contact is constantly present in the bottom right corner - you can choose which account to sync the new addition with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone app comes with a tabbed interface for speed dial, recent calls and all contacts. The dialer is invoked by taping on its dedicated key and supports smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging is pretty much straightforward as on every other droid out there. The standard messaging client features Material Design. Alternatives are also available in Google Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own Android keyboard is the default input method. The solution is one of the best on the market at the moment.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a Gallery app on board. It offers a basic browsing interface for images and can display videos too. You can also opt for Google Photos as means to view, backup and share your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player on board so we used the Gallery app instead. The video UI is quite simple. Supported video codecs include H.265, H.264, H.263, and MPEG-4. The Idol 3 handled major video file formats without breaking a sweat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel has bundled a highly-capable music player with the Idol 3. Codeveloped with JBL, the app, in addition to just playing your tunes, turns your phone into a pocketable DJ station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DJ functionality is activated via a toggle in the settings menu. Overall, the app is as fun to use as it is capable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no equalizer presets, but the Sound settings menu has an option for JBL sound enhancement. Unfortunately, we couldn't spot any difference regardless of whether we listened to music via the built-in loudspeakers or through the supplied JBL headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Idol 3 also offers FM Radio with RDS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is nicely clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 3 duo demonstrated spotlessly clean audio output when we made it work with an active external amplifier. There was nothing to separate the two sizes of the smartphone in the first test and differences were pretty minor in the second one too. The two got excellent scores all over the field with the average volume levels the only thing to frown at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were treated to more of the same when our standard pair of headphones came into play. Some extra stereo crosstalk appeared but there was no other damage to the output. So excellent marks for clarity but only passable ones for volume, which is once again less than impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP Sony IMX214 camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Idol 3 packs a 13MP camera with Sony IMX214 sensor. The unit is found in quite a few smartphones out there and has proven to be quite a solid performer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface holds no surprises. Capturing photos takes place via a button on the right side of the UI. Another one for video recording sits right above it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several shooting modes at your disposal. They include auto, HDR, panorama, time-lapse, scanner, and face beauty mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A manual mode is also available - it allows you to tweak white balance, shutter speed, ISO, and focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Alcatel Idol 3 models seem to use one and the same cameras. Image quality is generally very good. Processing seems mature enough and we're pleased with how the fine detail comes out when viewing the images at pixel level - especially the foliage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, image sharpness is not equal across the frame, suggesting the camera lens is not as good as the sensor used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, colors are great and noise is kept (mostly) in check, so overall, great snappers from these two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This sort of a nice image quality is a surprise in the price range of the cheaper 4.7-inch Alcatel Idol 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the built-in HDR mode produces images that are slightly overboard when it comes to colors and contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Judging by the photos taken, both models use seemingly identical cameras, however that's not the case when it comes to video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some reason the 1080p videos produced by the bigger Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) are substandard. They even look as if upscaled from lower resolution. In contrast, the ones coming out from the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7) are much better when it comes to colors and detail. So we are willing to give it the benefit of a doubt - it might be a unit specific issue or a software glitch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With both phones, there's room for improvement in video recording. Even though both smartphones produces videos with one and the same bitrate, the ones by the Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) come out in 28fps, while the ones by the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7) clock in less than 27fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see a 1080p video sample shot by the Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you can also download directly an Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) 1080p video sample (37MB) from our server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see a 1080p video sample shot by the Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7) on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you can also download directly an Alcatel Idol 3 (4.7) 1080p video sample (25MB) from our server.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel Idol 3 duo is yet another proof that users no longer need to part with large amounts of cash in order to get a top notch smartphone experience. The smartphones combine quality hardware and polished software into a well-designed, solidly made packages each in their respective market segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hardware-wise, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset and the 13MP Sony-made camera performed up to our expectations just as expected. The bright and crisp 5.5" 1080p IPS display on the other hand, should easily satisfy all but the most discerning smartphone users, especially in the price range that the Idol 3 (5.5) inhibits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The above applies for the 4.7" model as well. Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 doesn't quite match the oomph of the 615 model, but it has different competitors to face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loud stereo speakers make the smartphone truly stand out in its segment. Coupled with the memory card slot and the nice-looking displays, they truly make both Idol 3 models budget-friendly multimedia devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reversible phone design that they also share is perhaps an industry's first though it hardly solves any real issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overly colorful UI is another questionable solution, though, we believe, it's a matter of personal opinion. However, compared to Google's Material Design, we find Alcatel's a bit over the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel has priced the Idol 3 (5.5) for $249.99 unlocked and contract-free in the United States. At one point, the device's price was down to $199.99, thus making it one of the best smartphone bargains around. In Europe, it goes for around 250 euro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we looked around to see what else $250 can get you these days. Here are some of the most notable alternatives to Alcatel Idol 3 (5.5) for the money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus ZenFone 2 is undeniably the biggest threat to the Idol 5 (5.5). The Intel-powered phablet starts at $199.99 for a version with 2GB of RAM, and tops out at $299.99 for a variant with 4GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZenFone matches the camera and the screen of the Idol 3 and offers more capable chipset. However, it lacks stereo speakers and is (arguably) nowhere near as visually attractive as the Alcatel due to the extra body thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fresh off a major price cut, OnePlus One now costs only $249 for a 16GB version and $299 for a 64GB model. The "Flagship Killer" entices with a high-end aura and more powerful chipset, but lacks expandable memory and stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> OnePlus One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto G (2014) entices with stock Android, quick updates, stereo speakers, and expandable memory. The handset is a worthy rival to the Idol 3 (4.7), but is nowhere near as talented as the 5.5" model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto G (2nd gen)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year's HTC One (M8) flagship can be found easily for less than $300 unlocked online. The device impresses with gorgeous metal body and BoomSound stereo speaker among its many talents. However, its camera is nowhere near as good as the one of the Idol 3 (5.5).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One (M8)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note is a competing value proposition. It packs a FullHD 5.5-inch display, but has no microSD slot. The Mediatek MT6752 chipset is surprisingly well geared. What it lacks is the Idol 3's slim profile and overall more upmarket looks. There is also the question of finding a retailer that will take proper care of the after sales support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Meizu m1 note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel's parent company TCL has picked the right time to enter the US market with the Idol 3 (5.5). Two-year contracts are all but extinct and paying full price for a smartphone is no longer a crazy idea, thus making devices that offer value for money without skimping on features an increasingly popular commodity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users looking for a good smartphone on the cheap will certainly enjoy the Idol 3, so long as they can live with its small quirks. The handset is the best smartphone effort by Alcatel to date and a sign of more good things to come from the manufacturer.</paragraph>
