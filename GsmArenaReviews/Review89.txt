		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A while back Nokia released the 6600 pair - the slide and the fold - which we fell for, big time. The seemingly more popular sibling got an update and the 6600i slide will keep on cashing in. Slightly revamped, it brings a beefier camera and a new paintjob to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looks have changed just a bit and we honestly think they did it right. The consciously minimalist design of the original didn't leave much room for frills anyway. Alright, the 6600i slide is a no-frills package overall, but don't go saying we didn't warn you. It's enjoyable and addictive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No need to tell you, the "i" in any Nokia model designation is there to save face. It's like Nokia saying: here's a phone that sells big, so be our guest - keep on buying it. It's more of a relaunch than an update. And we're not pointing fingers here - if you have a massive seller the first thing on your mind would be to keep it rolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just remember the 6300 - it did wonders for the Finns, so the 6300i followed in due course. Yes, it added Wi-Fi to its predecessor's feature set but that can really be seen as an exception and was meant for select markets only. And by the way, Nokia might have a point. The 3G-enabled 6600 slide can do without WLAN and a better camera will perhaps serve its market better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, "i" models are incremental updates - they build on the previous device rather than turn it into something completely new. In that sense, the last people to be viewed as potential customers are current 6600 slide owners. If we were to upgrade from Nokia 6600 slide, we'd probably be considering Symbian - or maybe an all-in-one feature phone like the 6260 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, the real job of the 6600i slide is to pick up the customers the original missed and serve the Nokia midrange more in keeping with the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've made it safely to the first jump, so you get ready to head to the next page, while we bring up the Nokia 6600i slide retail box and prepare to look inside.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6600i slide unboxed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Nokia 6600i slide does well to cover the basics. In the box you'll find a charger, a shortish microUSB cable and a microUSB headset and a BL-4U battery. The headset is one piece, which makes finding a good alternative quite hard. There's a user manual of course, and a 1GB microSD card to get you started.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6600i slide 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600i slide measures 93 x 45 x 14.2 mm for a volume of 52 cc. The handset is remarkably compact with very clean and simple styling. The 6600i slide is a real tiny slider with a pleasingly solid feel and extra friendly handling. The weight of 110 g is mostly attributed to the metal body.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600i slide stays very close to the original. The front has changed just a bit reinforcing the minimalist design of the lineup. The rocker style keys gave way to discrete little knobs, while the gloss of the predecessor was replaced by sedate brushed metal. The overall styling is absolutely intact though and the upgrade is just as sweetly compact as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notch of an earpiece is centrally placed right above the Nokia logo up front. The 3G-enabled handset sports a video-call camera in the top right corner, right next to an ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.2" screen follows, which enjoys most of the slider estate. Instead of the glossy front of its predecessor, the Nokia 6600i slide sports brushed metal, which looks and feels better - and sure deals with the fingerprint issues of the original.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the 6600i is different than the one of the original Nokia 6600 slide, which raised the bar quite high. There is only one improvement perhaps - and it's the display is now totally flat as opposed to the convex screen of 6600 slide. That way, it sees quite less prone to scratching. And it also keeps the impressive side viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the negative side however, the backlight brightness is really not on par with what we're used to on Nokia handsets and thus screen legibility suffers to an extent. Nokia S40 interface traditionally doesn't provide any means for user control over the backlighting levels so we really hope Nokia would fix that with a future software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, we had the same grudge with the Nokia 6720, so it might be some new manufacturer's strategy to help battery life. Whatever the reason, we hope we don't see it in future Nokia phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the display are the D-pad, the soft keys and the Call and End keys. The navigation frame of the D-pad is nicely projecting over a very spacious and responsive confirm key. The soft and call keys are on the thin side too, though they fair better in usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding up unveils the alphanumeric keypad, which takes the entire lower deck of the phone. The plastic keys with pleasant metallic finish are amply sized, well defined and solid to press. Mistypes are quite unlikely, and we are very happy with the build quality and the comfort of use. Even the long-standing slider issue of insufficient headroom for the top row of keys is partly dealt with by the oval contour of the sliding bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white backlighting is strong enough to make using the handset easy enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top side of Nokia 6600i slide you'll find the microUSB data/headset port under a neat plastic cap and the battery cover latch. The lanyard eyelet is on the right. The bottom part is a solid deck of matt plastic, which is completely clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right and left side of the handset are pretty bare, featuring only the tiny charger plug al the way up on the right.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is made of the same brushed metal used at the front. On the rear there's a dual LED flash right next to the 5-megapixel camera lens. The lens deck is slightly raised, which means the phone rests on it when you put it down - that makes it prone to scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dead center at the bottom is the loudspeaker grill, aligned to an etched Nokia logo. One complaint we have here is that sound does get muffled when the phone is lying on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is firmly locked in place and released by a latch. Below it you'll find the Li- 1000 mAh (BL-4U) Li-Ion battery, the SIM compartment and, unfortunately, the microSD card slot (making hot-swapping cards a no-go).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tiny Nokia 6600i slide is a real treat to use. The elegant rounded lines and fingerprint concealing brushed metal do make the compact handset a rare gem. The sliding action is smooth and solid, but you have to put your thumb on the screen, which isn't as fingerprint resistant as the rest of the front surface. Sliding up by putting your finger bellow the D-pad is quite uncomfortable because of the small size of the phone and also might cause the top part to rub against the keypad deck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give you a better idea of the size, here's the 6600i next to the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface - typical Series 40 5th ed.<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600i slide employs the Series 40 5th edition user interface. The environment is well familiar and all, but we wish Nokia used the 6th edition. The differences aren't that many but some are vital - like the vastly improved browser. The 6600i slide offers good Ovi integration though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But no matter 5th or 6th edition, S40 remains lagging behind the feature phone interfaces offered by the major competitors. There are quite some contemporary features missing such as smart dialing, officer document viewer, a nice image gallery (possibly one with screen auto rotation), some motion-based gaming and especially, multi-tasking. Most competitors already allow user to minimize Java applications in the background - Nokia still doesn't. For more than a year now, Nokia S40 UI still remains in hard need of an update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The confirm key launches the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The D-pad directions can be set up as shortcuts too - by default, left brings up the new message menu and right the Calendar. The font on the main display can be of any color you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode is available. It consists of four sections that can be edited or relocated as users see fit. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions denoted by their respective icons. The second section displays today's events from the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A double tap on the phone surface brings up the time and date as well as any missed events. A double tap would also silence an incoming call or ringing alarm. The alarm is just silenced and not snoozed and unlike some other phones, turn-to-mute is not enabled for the 6600i slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons can also be freely reordered within the grid, should the user find their original order inconvenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were times when the interface would lag or and even freeze - not too often, but enough to spoil the experience. At the time of writing this review, we used the latest available software on a fully retail unit taken straight from the store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six predefined ringing profiles on the Nokia 6600i slide. These should be enough to cover virtually any scenario. They can be set to expire at a given time, returning the phone to the previous profile. Flight mode is on hand too, turning off all transceivers and rendering the phone usable without a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600i slide comes with a good deal of Ovi integration - there's Contacts, Share and even Maps. We'll check them out later on in the review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A know-it-all phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia 6600i slide stores up to 2000 contacts and that sounds more than enough. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names, eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization. Ringtones can be assigned to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. Caller image is different for incoming and outgoing calls. It fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and appears much smaller when you are calling one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contact list: standard Name List, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Image. It can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at once. Contacts can be ordered by either first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook font size can be either normal or large, and it's an option that will surely be appreciated. The bigger font fits just as many contacts on the screen by leaving a smaller gap between the lines. And lastly, the well-known grouping option is also present. This means that contacts can also be organized in groups and these can subsequently be used as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application to mention here is the voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice extra is the Find-on-Map option which locates the contact's address on the new Ovi Maps for S40 application if it is entered correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log on the Nokia 6600i slide is the well-known S40 application. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them in bulk. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is crystal-clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception and in-call sound cause no concerns with the Nokia 6600i slide. Like almost all current S40 midrange phones this one also has a Voice Clarity feature, to apply some sort of background noise suppression during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound is loud and clear on both ends and you will have zero trouble with your calls. Vibration on the 6600i slide is weak though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have not included any Smart dialing features, so punching some numbers on the standby screen would give you the "helpful" option to start a countdown timer (interpreting the numbers as hours, minutes and seconds) but won't search through your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out Nokia 6600i slide is an average performer. It's certainly an upgrade of the original Nokia 6600 slide mediocre performance, but it's not nearly enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Nokia 6600i slide, you can't count on getting just everything in noisier environments, and calm and subdued ringtones surely won't do. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite up to the task. The Nokia 6600i slide is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email, as well as flash and audio messages. Instant messages are covered as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do to turn a regular SMS into MMS is insert some kind of multimedia content. As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can fill by simple typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with the most recent addressees in the call register. There is even the very handy option to define a favorite message contact, one is all you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and organized in a practical time-saving manner. You enter a few letters of a contact's name and then click match. This brings up a list of matching contacts and selecting one prompts you to choose either a mobile number or an email address, then it will shift to the message body automatically where you can start typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The T9 dictionary and the handy delivery reports go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will break down into displayed on the screen. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type. A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio messages have a separate editor, which can either record the message on the fly or use a previously recorded sound clip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email is easy to set up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The email client does pretty well to meet most user needs. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up the email client was extremely easy. It just required an email address and entering and confirming the password, the 6600i slide took care of the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Either message headers only or entire messages can be downloaded by default, depending on your choice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is still the same<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S40 gallery has never been our favorite and as it hasn't changed pretty much since, our opinion of it is still the same. It's still a reasonably good file manager for a feature phone - it can move, copy, delete and send one or multiple files. Its picture viewing capabilities however are limited to pretty much just displaying the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is not the fastest (especially for larger pictures) or the most capable around - there are only two zoom levels, so it is practically of little use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures can also be viewed full screen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter offers a very limited number of options (in contrast to almost every Samsung phone with their suite of editing features), so Nokia 6600i slide users are highly unlikely to take up photo editing on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search option, which is quite convenient for finding a specific file in busy folders. There are no tags or albums like in S60, so folders and Search are the only options to organize your photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Traditional music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Without doubt, the music player is among the nicest applications of the Nokia 6600i slide. It has decent looks and all-round functionality, including album art, and a fair number of formats are supported. The theme can be set to match that of the rest of the phone, integrating it very well with the rest of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is controlled with the D-pad. Besides all the typical functions, the music player of Nokia 6600i slide also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, MP4, WMA, AMR-NB. Naturally A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one default theme available for the music player or you could use the player skin that's part of the currently selected UI skin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sonic experience gets enhanced by equalizer presets and stereo widening. There are 5 equalizer presets on Nokia 6600i but you can easily create new ones thanks to the two user defined slots available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the artist and title of the currently playing song are shown on the homescreen. They appear in the Radio and music area on the homescreen so they need to be active for the info to be displayed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS, can't play through the loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to the preloaded content on Nokia 6600i slide is the FM radio. It resembles the audio player interface and covers all basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the music player, the FM radio also has the standard theme and the 'Set by Themes' option, which uses the currently selected UI theme. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's strangely missing here is the option to play the FM radio sound through the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is basic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of Nokia 6600i slide is compatible with 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The option to hide soft key captions to make better use of the full screen mode also improves the viewing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixel camera with autofocus, fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600i slide is armed with a 5 megapixel camera for image resolution of up to 2592 x 1944 pixels. Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited but reasonable given the mid-range spot. The available settings include white balance, three quality levels going from basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED flash is rather inadequate,only really usable with close range objects. Another drawback is the lack of a dedicated camera key, the D-pad is in charge of focusing and capturing. With no half-press, you press down the center key to focus and release it to capture the scene, which means you can't change your mind and skip the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, keep in mind that holding the phone upright shoots in portrait mode. There's a landscape mode for the UI, which makes taking a landscape photo more convenient but it gets turned off each time you switch off the camera and you have to look for it in the Options menu. Since most photos are taken in landscape mode, defaulting to portrait is strange and awkward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6600i camera doesn't rank among the top 5 megapixel shooters. Image quality is quite poor - noise levels are high, but at least it's luminance noise only. Pictures suffer obvious lack of detail, but the snowstorm of noise will cover it anyway on to many occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In good lighting, the situation isn't as bad, but in low light, you'd end up with a blurry ghostly photo. The low contrast and oversharpening don't help either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The area in which the 6600i camera performs best is macro photography. While there isn't a dedicated macro mode, the camera focuses very well and produces quite pleasing pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera speed isn't remarkable - it takes a couple of seconds to focus, and about 5 seconds to save a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia 6600i slide. We pit it against one of our all time favorite 5MP snappers - Nokia 6700 classic. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording: VGA@15fps</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the Nokia 6600i slide manages VGA resolution at 15 fps. The 3GP video clips length is only limited by the memory available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600i video suffers seriously from the unwanted effects of the rolling shutter. A rolling shutter is usually used on all handsets equipped with a camera but the extent of the unwanted geometric distortion is especially pronounced with the 6600i slide videos. You can see the almost constant nasty jelly-like effect even though we've tried to keep the phone as steady as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a Nokia 6600i slide sample video shot at VGA resolution (15 fps).</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity offers videocalling, but not HSDPA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity set on the Nokia 6600i slide is bottom of the mid-end - sure, it's 3G capable but don't expect blazing speeds, as there's not HSDPA support. Video-calls are enabled though with a dedicated front-facing camera. There's quad-band GPRS and EDGE support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth version 2.0 with A2DP is also supported and that's that for the wireless connectivity. For wired connectivity, you get the typical microUSB port, which can be used to charge the phone too despite the presence of the good ol' Nokia charger plug.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the memory card slot, which can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring data, is also present here, however it's under the battery, which makes swapping it quite a hassle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Things went very wrong with the browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Where did they go wrong? For starters, it's not the WebKit-based browser that we saw on the 6700 classic and liked very much. This is because the 6600i slide uses the S40 5th edition, rather than the 6th edition of the 6700 classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever the reason, the browser's performance is inexcusable for a new handset - page rendering is way off the mark, there's no virtual mouse cursor or mini-map, making page navigation quite a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the behavior of the browser that annoyed us the most though - it stops loading a page and renders it very badly, but then you discover that it is in fact still loading, it's just the progress bar that has disappeared. When it does finish loading some of the rendering bugs disappear. Some. And don't even bother asking for full Flash support, S40 just doesn't have it, regardless of which edition it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some odd reason Opera Mini doesn't come preinstalled. We've gone over and over how good Mini is but here's the gist - it renders pages properly and cuts the data transferred to a third, both speeding things along (with no HSPDA, 6600i needs it) and cutting down on data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, one of the first things to do if you buy 6600i slide is to download Opera Mini. For now, version 4.2 is the one to choose, but most definitely have a look at version 5 beta as well - it's shaping up as a great browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is great as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia 6600i slide is very elaborate, offering a large number of time management applications with nice features and a user-friendly interface. The calendar offers month, week, and day modes and five types of events can be set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. The event types are: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Furthermore, each type of event has its own specific fields and some of them even allow an alarm to be set up as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next-in-line is the handy To-Do manager that enables you to organize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be assigned alerts, as well as marked off once accomplished. Those can also be easily synchronized with the calendar application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable: it can be set to go off on any selected days of the week, even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish. The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are available as well - their length is limited to 3000 characters. Finally, the Nokia 6600i slide calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition a loan calculator is also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A few basic applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The consistently useful unit converter is first in the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application offers Yahoo Search out of the box, though other search engines might be available depending on your country and region (e.g. the UK gets Live Search too). Searching is web-based only, no option for local.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final featured application is World clock for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Share and Contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We'll have a look at Maps in the next chapter, but let's check out Ovi Share and Ovi contacts first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Share allows you to share images, video and audio files. Such services have become very popular and Ovi Share is Nokia's way of getting its foot in the door. It's free and you have access to unlimited storage. After a quick sign-up process, selecting files for uploading is easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This app is somewhat limited though in that you can only browse yours and your friends' uploads. For general browsing you'd need a web browser (the built-in one works well enough for once). Bear in mind that 5 megapixel photos can cost you quite a lot at the end of the month if you're not on an unlimited data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Contacts goes about giving you access to another of the Internet's most time-consuming services - instant messaging. Ovi contacts integrates tightly with the phonebook as a new tab and offers an IM client with a twist. You can search for people already registered with Ovi or send an invitation to anybody using Gmail since the Ovi contacts supports G-Talk, Google's own IM, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to this service you will be able to chat in real time with all your Ovi/Google Talk-connected contacts, change your status messages and mood, and all that kind of social networking stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition you can share the name and the artist of the track you are currently listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is fine and dandy but here's the stumbling block - S40 doesn't have multitasking. And since Ovi Contacts is a Java app rather than a native one, you can give up any hopes of switching between it and the rest of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have rigged a way around this - you have the option to remain online when you quit the app and new messages show up as notifications on the screen. Choosing to reply starts the Contacts app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen has a pleasant surprise - you can put Contacts on the homescreen, which shows the number of friends online and even a message when you receive one, complete with sound notifications for a contact coming online or receiving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We say Nokia "rigged" the solution because it's far from perfect - if you receive a longer message you can only see part of it on the screen, reading the entire message requires launching the app. It's just a click away but it takes a few seconds for Contacts to load. If you want to delete a friend from the Contacts tab in the phonebook, the application will start itself, ask your confirmation and then close again. And all this going back and forth is just to get around the lack of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps for S40 can plan routes, need external GPS receiver</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By now you're aware that the 6600i slide doesn't have built-in GPS, but Maps can work without one - you can browse the maps, look up addresses, plan routes, but you'll have to do without voice guided navigation. Furthermore it won't give you your general location using Cell-ID like Google Maps does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Map Loader application for PC you can download map data to a compatible computer, and transfer it to your device to save on potential wireless data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps offer straightforward route planning. Having entered a start point and a destination, the application will plan your route with easy-to-follow directions to where you're heading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you pair the phone with a Bluetooth GPS unit, it turns into a full-fledged navigation decice. Furthermore, turn-by-turn visual and voice guidance are available upon purchasing a navigation license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Saving locations in the Favorites section is another available option. The contents of Favorites can have different icons and can also be exported/sent via MMS, which is a nice extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps also work with the phonebook, so if you have the address of a contact stored in the phonebook you can quickly plan a route to that contact's home or office.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good pastime package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are four games preinstalled and they are diverse enough to help most people kill a bit of time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up is Bounce tales - a fun, cartoony platformer that follows the adventures of a blob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brain champ is a collection of simple puzzles - a variant of Simon Says, simple math questions (2 + 4 = ?). The puzzles may be simple but since you're running against the clock, things can still get pretty competitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seasweeper is a variation on Minesweeper, with submerged rocks instead of mines, that uses a square and a hexagonal grid. It includes an arcade mode, in which you pick up bonuses and earn cash as you guide a fleet of ships through treacherous waters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An all time classic is here too - Snake, version 3. It offers classic mode or adventure mode, which puts a slightly different twist to the game. There's even multiplayer mode over Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, here we are - the Nokia 6600i slide is a compact, well built and sturdy phone. And a beautiful one, we're keen to add. The spec sheet gives the impression of an excellent feature phone too - 3G and videocalling, 5 megapixel camera, Nokia Maps and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, make sure to read the fine print - 3G, but no HSDPA, and the built-in browser is no good. The 5MP camera will produce satisfactory shots in perfect conditions but is far from top-of-the-line - we don't really know why they even bothered upgrade. Even the lack of 3.5mm audio jack and the not-so-good prebundled headset will push some users away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're among the people that don't really care about those things, and only use the phone for calling and texting, you'll probably be alright (but note the ringing volume is on the low side).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6600i slide is still a good package, if you're ready to put up with its limitations. Some of them are not that hard to work around - installing Opera Mini takes a minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the alternatives the first thing to pop up is the Nokia 6700 classic. Its design and build are towel on par (if not superior) and it addresses a lot of the things that we didn't like in the 6600i. As with almost anything however, good things come at a price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6700 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U900 Soul is a golden oldie so to speak. It's not too old mind you, even in gadget years. It's got the looks, it's got the camera, and it's even got the 7.2Mbps HSDPA data speeds. And since it's been around for a while it's quite easy on the pocket. The Samsung S7350 Ultra s is newer (and more expensive) but throws in GPS, D1 video recording and DivX support into the mix, not to mention the larger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung U900 Soul ? Samsung S7350 Ultra s </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The predecessor - the Nokia 6600 slide - is also worth a look. It doesn't have a 5MP camera or support for 16GB microSD cards but that's about it. It's not that much cheaper, but not for long - now that the update has hit the stores. Just be warned of it's below average ringer volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While still on the matter, make sure to check out the Nokia 6260 slide too. Definitely not as pretty, but GPS and Wi-Fi might be worth the extra cash (HSDPA, HSUPA and Carl Zeiss optics sound nice too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 6600 slide ? Nokia 6260 slide </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600i slide is a cute little set and a decent midrange package. It obviously isn't a cameraphone, or a business tool. But then again, the likely shoppers of this handset will probably value aesthetics and not demand cutting edge technology. So, power users can safely move along, but everyone else is welcome to give the 6600i slide a shot.</paragraph>
