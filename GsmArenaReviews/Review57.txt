			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson may be green at heart but it sure looks like a red hot package complete with imaging, connectivity and novel design. Makers are keen to ride the green wave and phones are rushing to catch up. It seemed Sony Ericsson's GreenHeart had a slow start. But after a nice and easy rehash and the no-frills Naite, the GreenHeart is getting a speed boost with the Elm and the Hazel. Eco-friendly materials are combined with top-notch features and the already must-have social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elm is not the standard feature phone we've got used to seeing from Sony Ericsson. Its true power is well hidden inside and the exterior makes sure the Elm will take more than a casual look. This candybar packs all the connectivity you will ever need - Wi-Fi, DLNA, GPS receiver, Bluetooth, 3G support with HSPA and microSD card slot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Elm at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surely, the specs above reveal the Elm's intention to give you a square deal besides the eco-friendly factor. In this quick preview we'll be trying to look beyond the promises the Sony Ericsson Elm is making. The handset we have is far from mature software-wise but the hardware is all there and the finish looks good. The trademark Sony Ericsson Flash-based UI is at its usual best but some of the promised extras will obviously have to wait for a more final unit and a proper review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook integration is no news since the C901, but the Elm is keen to bring more - Facebook, Twitter and MySpace all a click away on your homescreen, courtesy of a novel widget system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since none of those are available on our test sample, we guess widgets and social networking will perhaps be the final touches to the Elm - and some of it will even be left to carriers themselves. But there's still enough stuff to check about an ambitious handset with a small environmental footprint and a long spec sheet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Elm 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm is a compact candybar measuring 110 x 45 x 14 mm. Candybar is not to be taken literally though. The Elm is slightly curved at the rear to give it that unmistakable silhouette, and a very comfortable and secure hand feel. The handset is small enough to fit in any pocket or purse, and along with the small size comes the friendly weight of just 90 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lightweight it is, but the Elm feels quite nice to hold thanks to its quality materials. Plus, most of the weight is concentrated at the bottom for a secure grip and comfortable typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Elm is part of the Sony Ericsson GreenHeart lineup, which is all about recycled plastics, reduction of hazardous substances and eco-friendly packaging. The concept is clear enough but - more importantly - the green-conscious Elm doesn't compromise with looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone combines fingerprint-proof matt plastic and aluminum in an asymmetric pattern, which goes well with the unusual curved shape. The Sony Ericsson Elm will be available in two colors: Metal Black and Pearly Rose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The irregular design shape (called human curvature) might be a self-conscious accent but it works more than well. The weight balance is perfect: the numpad sticks to your thumb and the risk of the phone tipping over backwards is near zero.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elm has the extra girth right where it matters too - around the shutter key. So, all in all, the unusual shape works quite in its favor - the Elm looks unusual enough to stand out but ergonomics are remarkable too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm employs a 2.2" 256K-color TFT display of QVGA resolution. What we miss here is the superb clarity and contrast of the C901 Cyber-Shot. The Elm's screen however is close and sunlight legibility and contrast aren't disappointing. They just don't seem enough to match the C901 quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display it's the regular Sony Ericsson navigation deck - designers have only experimented with the buttons' shape and layout. With the Elm we're possibly looking at one of the most tactile and comfortable designs. The distinct press is very welcome too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is near perfect too: very solid to press in all four directions and a large and comfy confirm button. The metallic frame of the D-pad nicely matches the handset's aluminum rear cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad is made of the same rubber-like plastic used for the controls and the D-pad. The numpad buttons are big enough and nicely convex for great touch orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Key presses involve a distinct click and typing is quick and easy. The soft white keypad backlighting is strong and even. The numpad is slightly arched inward to make it extra easy on the thumb and the great weight distribution of the body is another boost to comfortable typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson Elm features nothing but the regular Fast Port - unfortunately. Traditionally, this proprietary connectivity port doesn't have any protective cover to conceal the connectors and keep dust away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset hosts the nicely shaped volume rocker - which doubles as a zoom lever when taking or browsing pictures. The shutter key is further down - at the thickest part of the handset's body. The little round knob is very responsive with distinct half and full press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear side of the handset features the 5 megapixel camera lens, the LED flash and the loudspeaker. The battery cover is made of aluminum and has the Sony Ericsson logo. There is no protection on the camera lens, except a slight bulge around it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover (using the tiny cleft on top) unveils the standard Sony Ericsson BST-43 Li-Po battery with a capacity of 1000 mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer claims the battery should provide up to 430 hours of standby and up to 9.5 hours of talk time in a GSM-only network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, battery life ranged over two to five days on a single charge, depending mainly on multimedia usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also under the battery cover is the microSD memory card slot. It is hot-swappable, you just have to remove the back cover to access it. There is no eject mechanism so you'd better have some strong nails to to pull the card out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm is a compact candybar and the unusual curved shape works well in its favor. The handset certainly knows to make a good first impression but we're sure users will appreciate the ergonomics too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: a promise for social networking integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Elm uses the regular Sony Ericsson feature phone UI that's used in most of their midrange handsets. The Flash UI is well familiar and praised for its looks, speed and multitasking ability. The new GreenHeart handsets pledge to bring Social Networking integration as homescreen widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately our Elm pre-release unit didn't have any of this implemented yet. But we've already caught a glimpse of the Sony Ericsson social networking integration. Remember the Facebook integration on the C901? The app is enabled to run in the background, and your contacts who are currently online appear on the homescreen as small thumbs with mood updates. It's a handy option with nice visuals: all the thumbs are semi-transparent and switch from one another every 3 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We suppose the promised new Twitter and MySpace integration will work in a similar way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is well familiar, the one noticeable change being the dedicated Application icon, which is now the first item in the grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is visually appealing and snappy. There's screen auto rotation is enabled in the Media Center and is generally quite responsive. There's a barely noticeable lag involved but we guess that's to be preferred over an over-sensitive accelerometer that can often play up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Elm supports Flash Lite themes, which change the color scheme and wallpaper. Our handset has four themes preinstalled: Flow, Greenheart, Harp, and Melody. The Greenheart theme, logically, is the default one - the others sport darker color schemes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson handsets also come with a handy option for their wallpaper - you can use an application as a background instead of an actual image. Of course you can't just use any application - the choice is currently limited to a few apps. These are Calendar Wallpaper, Walk Mate and Standby World Clock 3D.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixel shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm has a 5 megapixel camera capable of producing images at a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. The handset is equipped a LED flash, which also serves as auto-focus assist light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel autofocus camera offers a lot of extra features such as smile shutter, face detection, auto-rotate, macro mode, spot metering, image geo-tagging, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera toolbar at the bottom gives access to shoot mode, scenes, picture size, focus, flash, self-timer, metering mode, white balance, effects, and settings Multi Menu. The Elm doesn't have manual ISO setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus mode has an extra feature - Face detection. The face recognition system allows you to simultaneously track as many as 3 faces but focus is locked on the one that's closest to the center of the frame when the image is captured.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using Smile Shutter is easy - first you fully press the camera key all the way down to activate it. A small blinking yellow icon in the right upper corner indicates that the mode is on and the phone will automatically snap the photo as soon as it "spots" a grinning face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cell-ID geotagging is available too, just remember that it involves a small amount of traffic, so you'll be billed for data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated macro mode in the Elm allows you to take images from as close as 10 cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full-res samples didn't look so well and that's the reason we provide you only with 1024x768 samples. Processing is still about to be fine-tuned, so we'll comment on the photo quality as soon as we get a retail unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Elm is also capable of capturing video, and it actually surprised us in that department. The Elm captures VGA videos at 30fps. The LED flash can be used in video mode too. The clips are stored in mp4 format and take about 7 MB for every minute of recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video quality looks promising at this stage and we are eager to see the final result once the phone goes retail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Media Center: rich multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Elm runs the same flash-based Media Center found in its most recent siblings. It serves as the launch base to Photos, Music, Video, Games and RSS feeds. The Media Center settings are quite simple - you can opt for portrait, landscape or auto-rotate modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Player to be found in the Elm is version 4.0 - the same as the most recent Sony Ericsson Walkman phones. Across the Media Center menus, you can enjoy screen auto-rotation. The player supports numerous file formats, including the regularly used MP3, WAV, WMA, M4A and E-AAC plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening. The player can naturally run in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available player styles are the same we already met in the Yari and Aino and use many Flash animations. You may opt for a spinning vinyl with some fancy buttons around it, or an old gramophone, a tape-recorder, or even a home stereo system. Every one of these styles gives the player look and feel a total overhaul.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface colors of the Media center vary across different themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in the Media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, and the interface is simple and stylish. The video files are accessible via the file manager too. The other extras include fullscreen mode and screenshot capability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no XviD or DivX support of course, but Sony Ericsson are promoting their MediaGo desktop software for video transfers and conversions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to our the Elm now, the Media center video section also houses the pre-installed YouTube client. It gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarked favorites and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image gallery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery is also the same - it stores the shots you've taken, along with prebundled or uploaded images, and offers some extra options like mark as favorite and photo feed. Latest Photo provides quick access to the most recent photos. Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year and when a month is open, it reveals a 3 x 4 grid of photo thumbs. Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the corresponding month with the highlighted photo slightly enlarged for better viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures section again opens as a 3 x 4 grid of thumbs with non-camera images such as the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the fullscreen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can send your pictures directly to your web albums, via MMS or Bluetooth. If the retail version software provides the promised social network integration, the uploading options will probably be even more varied.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Elm is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images using Cell-ID. When browsing tagged images in the gallery, the View-on-map option displays the location where the picture was taken directly on the preinstalled Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PhotoDJ, VideoDJ and MusicDJ are signature apps for all Sony Ericsson feature phones, and are available here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser and more coming up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Elm has quite a lot in common - including web browser and applications - with the Sony Ericsson Hazel. We'll be looking closer at those in our Sony Ericsson Hazel preview, which is coming up in the following days. Stay tuned.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm isn't a revolutionary device but it sure has a front spot in the company's feature phone lineup. It's arguable whether GreenHeart will be as compelling as Cybershot or Walkman, but the Elm is certainly not limited to an eco-friendly niche. Right the opposite, together with the Hazel, it ventures to take charge of the Sony Ericsson midrange at a moment when the company is radically reshaping its portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With top-notch connectivity, good 5 megapixel imaging, the green commitment and new approach to social networking, the Elm has a strong enough identity that goes well beyond GreenHeart. A small, lightweight and feature-rich phone, with a distinct design, sounds like a good recipe for success.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had such a nice time with it we may be tempted to overstate its sales potential. It may be too much and too early to call it a bestseller but it's all cheers on Elm street at present.</paragraph>
