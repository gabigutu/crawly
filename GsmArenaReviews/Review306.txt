			<paragraph>Samsung sets two contenders running for glory, with two 5 megapixel newcomers on the cameraphone market. The Samsung G600 was first to be announced, and had the mobile community astir. Featuring quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support, a glamorous 2.2" 16M color TFT display and stereo Bluetooth, the Samsung G600 is easily a tempting all-around multimedia device. The stylish design, the choice of colors and the metallic touch add up to some really exquisite looks. You may as well have a soft spot for this baby already but we are here to make sure its appeal is more than skin-deep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600 was the first GSM cameraphone by the Korean manufacturer to feature a 5 megapixel camera module. The checkered flag is nowhere in sight in the megapixel race, but obviously 2007 will be marked for the successful conquering of the 5 megapixel barrier. We really don't think the megapixel count is all that important when it comes to image quality - there's so much more to it, like color rendering, digital noise and dynamic range. But let's not get into the photographic mumbo jumbo; we're reviewing a mobile phone after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>How about a brief look back though, before we go? You know, a little bit of context won't hurt. Samsung D900 proved quite a gifted contender in the 3 megapixel shootouts we did in the past. In fact, it even got our recommendation as the best cameraphone in the slider form factor last year. The G600 is in for quite a challenge meeting this kind of expectations. Samsung D900 is already well in the past though, so let's get on with it. More after the jump.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Another go at sliders<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, Samsung are obviously really fond of the slider form factor. Given the number of sliders and clamshells in their portfolio, it's a safe bet that the bar form factor is somewhat out of favor for the most part. The Samsung G600 is a relatively compact handset, though not exactly the Ultra stuff. It's in fact the most compact 5 megapixel handset to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A lot of metal is used for the body finish making for a really fine and sophisticated handset. Above the display there is a large loudspeaker grill. In fact, as with most Samsung sliders, the earpiece and the loudspeaker are nested together. There is also a special ambient light sensor that controls the display brightness - bright for sunlight, dim for darkness. It's a nice perk and this is the first time Samsung are using it. The navigation keypad is below the relatively large 2.2" TFT display, which surprisingly can visualize up to 16M colors. That's another first for Samsung. We suppose that putting a 16M color display into a feature phone was only possible by throwing in a more powerful processor. That would also explain the unusually snappy user interface. The D-pad under the display is rather conservative (we've all seen what Samsung can do with scroll wheels and touch sensitive keys), though surprisingly comfortable and user-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad is pretty much the same - great for typing without looking at the keys at all. Although the keys are almost completely flat, tactile feedback is great. As usual Samsung does well with sliding springs (there we go again with sliders and clamshells).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side of the Samsung G600 only features the camera shutter key and the memory card slot. The shutter key for the camera is a two-step one, much like on a digital camera. A halfway press focuses and locks the exposure, while the full press actually takes the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would have appreciated a dedicated Camera mode key on the right side of the G600, much like the one we saw in Samsung E590. The microSD memory card slot is hot-swappable, which is usual for Samsung handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the Samsung G600 features the connectivity port used for connecting the charger, data cable, or the wired headset. Samsung have chosen to implement a brand new connector in both G600 and G800. Peripherals from past models won't do here - the same holds true vice versa. The good news though is that the G600 pre-bundled headset has a 3.5 mm standard audio adapter, so you can change it for your favorite headphones. The volume keys are on the left side of the G600, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and the bottom sides of the G600 are completely bereft of controls, quite typical of mobile phones in the slider form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Samsung G600 is interestingly curved to mirror the curve on the front, right beneath the display, where the D-pad begins. The back curve is in the upper part and we find it a nice design touch. Or, it could've been made to accommodate the hulking camera module when the slider is closed. Sliding the front of the slider up, reveals the 5 megapixel camera and the LED flash. The camera is meant to be used with the slider in landscape position, which means that you will end up with a finger on the lens once too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the curved back panel reveals the Samsung 880 mAh Li-Ion battery. It's quoted at up to 300 h standby time and up to 3 h 30 min talk time. In reality the battery preformed fairly - we had to recharge the G600 every three days or so when without making a full time job of fiddling with the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really liked the way the Samsung G600 feels in hand. The smooth metal finish and the comfortable size and weight make for a really pleasurable experience. If you find it hard to understand our appreciation for the classic Samsung lines, a few days of using the G600 will inevitably change your opinion.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Brand new display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 has a shiny 2.2" TFT screen of QVGA resolution capable of displaying up to 16M colors. Visibility under direct sunlight is OK. The display is well done and Samsung deserve a thumbs up for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white keypad backlighting is even and strong enough. The navigation key has circular backlighting along the edges and, if nothing else, the backlighting adds to the high degree of user-friendliness the Samsung G600 offers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The better side of a mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 is great at calls - nothing less than you would've expected. You can make or receive calls with the slider closed too. Dialing a number has always been fun with Samsung but this time there is only one dialing animation available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung G600 loudspeaker test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600 was not among the loudest handsets we have tested in our loudspeaker loudness test. In fac it only rated somewhere in the botoom of the tested handsets that bear the mark "good" in this test. It saves the G600 from complete failure, however it doesn't put it on top of our list. Here is how the G600 ranks along some of the other handsets that have entered the loudness test. More info on our test and all current results can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The latest Samsung user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 features dynamic animated wallpaper as usual. Of course you can change that with a wallpaper of your choice. If you stick with the animated one, known in the past as Samsung uGo, it will automatically update the home screen background to display landmarks of the city or country you're in. The scenery even changes when night falls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In standby, the up direction of the navigation key activates the proprietary Samsung My Menu. It features several user-configurable shortcuts for your convenience. As it has always been with Samsung handsets, pressing the confirm key on the pad in standby launches the web browser - a truly inconvenient solution but one gets used to that eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600 features the interface styling we first saw in Samsung E950. The G600 menu interface has an advantage over Samsung E950, as it offers lovely animation effects. There are four animation styles (slide, door, zoom, fade) to choose from and the handset deals well with all of them. We are under the impression that the G600 is equipped with a rather capable processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface supports skinning through themes. There are several presets but you can create ones of your own too. The number of the main menu icons displayed is a total of twelve. You can choose whether list menus should be available as pop-ups (Samsung old-school) that come up when you highlight a menu item, or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 is also the first Samsung handset to actually have full-featured ringing profiles. All we used to get with previous models was the Silent and Normal ringing modes. Now there's a choice of 5 profiles, including the Offline mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new thing about the menu system is that all settings are put together in one place - phone, light, display, messages, calls, phonebook settings, etc. are all easily accessible from one place. A centralized setting for choosing the default memory for different applications is also available - you can set that for the camera, voice recorder, FM radio (with the G600 you can record FM broadcasts), Bluetooth, WAP downloads, etc - all in the same place. It's really convenient.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Listing your contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung G600 can store up to 1000 contacts with multiple fields. It can display the names from the phone memory only or all names from both the phone memory and the SIM card at once. Searching employs gradual typing. A total of 12 fields of information are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers for each contact, plus an email address and a note. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture; contacts can be organized into groups. Individual contact details or your whole contacts list can be sent via Bluetooth. Unlike Samsung E950, the G600 now has a field for a contact's birthday.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There aren't any innovations in the call management department. The Dial key on the touchpad opens a list of the recent contacts, while opening the Call log from the main menu will provide additional details. We were let down by the fact that there is no longer a message counter, which monitors the received and sent messages - it's a feature present in all the Samsung Ultra II lineup handsets. However there's the new Call Manager that allows you to limit your call times and call costs or filter the incoming calls with a Reject list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Swift messenger<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600 manages SMS, EMS, MMS, and emails. SMS, EMS and MMS use one and the same editor. MMS are created through a selection from the menu or by inserting an image, which makes the editor automatically switch from SMS to MMS. EMS allows you to apply formatting and font colors to your text messages. SMS can have maximum 1836 characters (12 message parts). The number of the 160-symbol chunks that a longer message breaks down to is shown in the upper part of the message composer. T9 dictionary is there to assist you; both browsing and adding new words is fast and intuitive. If sending fails, say because of a network failure, the message is saved to the Outbox. The Samsung G600 has no limitation for stored messages as the shared memory is used. When sending your messages you can find the recipients name in either the recent contacts list, or the phonebook. You can also search for it in the groups, or in a custom recipient list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is relatively good. It can manage up to four accounts - POP or IMAP; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments. The client can be set up to check mail at predefined intervals (user-configurable, of course).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lovely picture box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 file browser is pretty much standard for Samsung handsets. The phone memory and the memory card are separate but they both have the same folder structure. There are folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, games and other, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. The functionality of the file browser is adequate. You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create or delete folders (except for the root ones). Files can be sent again one by one or in bulk via Bluetooth. Throughout the whole file manager you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 picture gallery is a part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening the Images folder. We are delighted with the style and speed of the picture gallery. It's the first time we see such a good picture gallery in a Samsung handset. Once you highlight a thumbnail it automatically pops up to offer a larger preview. And the speed is just amazing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can copy or move images but only to the Images folder on the memory card and vice versa. Unlike Samsung E950 here you can sort images according to their date, type, name, or size. The Slideshow function offers different types of transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can scroll sideways to see the next images without having to return to the image list. You can view the picture full screen, but only in portrait mode (landscape pictures get cropped a bit). Additionally, you can zoom in on a picture to a point the image gets unrecognizable. Browsing the 5-megapixel photos was incredibly fast, as well as zooming and panning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish you can do a bit of editing on your pictures using the integrated Scalado Image Editor, which is quite fast and rich in features. Processing images is quick but editing still takes time since all the features are organized in intricate submenus, which makes applying different effects a rather lengthy process. The Scalado Image Editor allows you to apply 13 special filters such as stamp, black and white, sepia, negative, milky, antique, fog, moonlight, color boost, posterize, solarize, blur, and sharpen. Then you can get serious with other effects like despeckle, noise, oil paint, emboss, sketch, sketch color, cartoon, paint, frosted glass, magic pen, spotlight, mirror. You can also adjust levels, brightness, contrast and color. You can of course flip, rotate and crop the image, as well as apply one of 10 warp styles that make pretty funny portrait images. Options are so many that elaborating on all of them calls for a full-fledged software review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player is even better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Armed with 55MB of internal memory and a microSD card slot, the Samsung G600 can be comfortably used as a portable music player. The Music player application allows filtering tracks by artist, album, genre and composer or you can choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to or the ones that you've played the most. Custom playlists can be created too. You can minimize the application to continue playing in the background. The player does have several equalizer presets plus "wide" and "surround" presets (you cannot create your own, though). You can rate tracks and mark them as favorites. You can subscribe to audio podcasts too. What's even better, there are three new fullscreen animations that run in the background of the player and enhance its looks. The name of the currently playing song scrolls horizontally on the home screen once you minimize the application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the first time has Samsung provided a standard audio jack adapter complete with a remote and a microphone. You can listen to music with the retail headset or you can plug your favorite headphones and still enjoy hands-free telephony. You can also use a Bluetooth headset for listening to music - both a mono and a stereo one will do the job, as Samsung G600 supports the Bluetooth A2DP profile. You can even listen music on two Bluetooth headsets simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we couldn't test the audio quality of the Samsung G600, as we got our handset without the 3.5 mm audio adapter. By the way, the connectivity port used this time is not the regular Samsung one we all know from previous models. It's a new one, which is also used in the Samsung G800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 comes complete with an FM radio, which is a welcome feature. You can store up to 30 radio stations. There is no RDS but you can set user-defined names to the stations just so you know which one to choose next time. The radio can also play in the background, much like the music player. The most unique thing about the radio is that you can actually record programs with it - we've never seen a feature like this in a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Music player and the FM radio have similar interfaces; the same holds true for the video player interface, too. It doesn't have many features but it can play video files in fullscreen landscape mode and you can fast-forward and rewind videos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixels score a mark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung G600 features a promising 5 megapixel camera with a LED flash, which can take pictures at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. Armed with auto focus, it's supposed to do well enough on both close and distant subjects. As we already pointed out earlier, the Samsung D900 cameraphone was good enough to earn a recommendation as the best 3 megapixel slider a year ago. Samsung cameraphones have been evolving ever since - in terms of picture quality we haven't seen earthshaking progress. However the improvements in speed and user interface are evident. The Samsung G600 is the latest and most advanced of all Samsung cameraphones available in terms of speed, user interface and megapixel count. The shutter key is a two-step one, much like on a digital camera. A halfway press focuses and locks the exposure, while the full press actually takes the picture. This half-shutter mode has been available in Sony Ericsson Cyber-shot handsets for quite some time now, but it first appeared in a Samsung phone with the E590, which was not really long ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is intuitive and follows the current trend of presenting settings on a toolbar in the bottom of the screen while options appear as popup menus. The settings are extensive and include picture size, shooting mode (single shot, multi-shot, mosaic, panorama), effects (black and white, sepia, negative, emboss), white balance, ISO (up to ISO 800), and viewfinder mode (regular, with indicator icons on and with guidelines).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among all those, an interesting feature is the Mosaic shot seen on previous Samsung handsets too, which allows you to make photo collages - however those turn out in rather low resolution. The multi-shot mode allows you to take several shots in rapid succession with only one press of the shutter. The Samsung G600 can take up to 9 shots in a row at high quality compression and up to 15 shots at normal quality compression. The gridlines that appear in the viewfinder (turning them on is optional) are there to help you frame your shots like a pro, adhering to the photographic rule-of-thirds. Using it to align your subjects and place points of interest on or near the lines and their intersecting points makes your photos more professional and aesthetic. The rule-of-thirds also applies to landscape shots. For example, the sky should take either one third or two thirds of the frame, instead of placing the horizon in the center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality has several different variables such as resolution (meaning image detail, not megapixel count), color accuracy, noise, and noise suppression techniques. There are also other things to watch for - highlight/shadow detail (which is the dynamic range), contrast, sharpness and sharpening processing, and chromatic aberrations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general the image quality of the photos produced by Samsung G600 is on an average level. The photos don't have really that much of detail; however we found medium noise levels and no traces of noise suppression processing. The auto focusing is generally reliable so it should get the job done. In terms of dynamic range we consider the G600 on par with Sony Ericsson K850 for example, and while the picture contrast is good, on some photos we experienced purple fringing. Possibly the greatests flaws we found with the Samsung G600 camera are the relatively slow shot-to-shot time and the processing it does on the captured images. The mobile oversharpens the images and it leaves some artifacts along the edges of sharpened subjects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 Mode setup page is where you switch between camera and camcorder, where you turn on the Scene mode and where you will find the "back-office settings" as we like to call them. They include stuff like picture quality (normal, fine, superfine), scene modes (auto, party/indoor, beach/snow, sunset, and dusk/dawn), exposure metering (matrix, center-weighted and spot), shutter sound (can be set to off), zoom sound, brightness sound, auto focus beeps, default storage memory and default naming for photos. As you can see, there are wide-ranging settings, as one might expect in a sophisticated cameraphone. There is even a macro mode, but our test showed there's not much need for it, as the auto focus handles most close-up shots just fine without turning the macro mode on. The most awkward thing about the camera is that to turn the scene mode on, you have to go to the "back-office" settings, select "scenes" and only after that do they appear on the regular settings toolbar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 camera is also able to shoot video - in the so-called Camcorder mode. There is an upgrade in the video recording department, as all recent Samsung handsets reached only CIF video resolution (352 x 288 pixels) at 15 fps. With Samsung G600 you now have VGA resolution (640 x 480 pixels) at your disposal - alas at only 15 fps. Recording length is only limited by the available free memory. The user interface of the camcorder is pretty much the same as the one of the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are captured in MPEG-4 format so they are easily playable on a PC with most video playing software. Having VGA resolution is a real nice thing for a feature phone, but the 15 fps ruined the pleasure for us (Nokia 6233 offered the same combo). Previous Samsung models had the same issue with CIF resolution, they only recorded it at 15 fps, while to get the more enjoyable 30 fps you had to go down to QVGA resolution. At least, now with the Samsung G600 you can record CIF videos at 30 fps with ease. That is not that bad, having in mind that the VideoCD standard uses CIF video resolution too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Making connections<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung G600 you can count on EDGE and GPRS for browsing internet on the go. As we've already mentioned, the G600 also comes equipped with Bluetooth which even allows listening to music on a stereo headset (A2DP profile support). Bluetooth works seamlessly when transferring data to and from a PC too. You can set certain files or folders visible or invisible to the Bluetooth File Browser service according to your needs. A data cable will allow for even faster file transfers. Using the phone as a modem with a PC is also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of cable connections we should point out once again that the Samsung G600 uses a new connectivity port that is incompatible with older peripherals from previous Samsung handsets. The Samsung G800 is another handset that uses the same port. Such a step seems an odd decision and we just can't understand it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NetFront 3.4 web browser of the Samsung G600 is excellent for a feature phone - it renders pages well. EDGE doesn't provide great speeds, however we are content with the browser. It offers a mini-map so that you know where you are on large pages, and it even has a virtual cursor, which highlights the currently active hyperlink or field. There are three different zoom levels and you have a text search function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NetFront browser also offers landscape browsing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Making the most of your time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are three types of events available: appointment, anniversary and task. Much like on previous Samsung handsets, you can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick which day the week starts on - Monday or Sunday. Up to five alarms are available and each can be set to repeat on given days of the week. There's a separate setting for the type of snooze you would like to have for each alarm. You can of course choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also offers a To-do manager, a voice recorder, a world time application, a calculator, and a unit converter. A countdown timer and a stopwatch will cater to sports-minded users. Samsung G600 supports Java, so downloading additional applications or games is not a problem. The interesting thing about the Calculator is that it offers a direct link to the Converter, it can save your calculations and it offers some advanced mathematical functions to choose from.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stamp it!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to additional applications, Samsung gets a well deserved pat on the shoulder for the integrated Office documents viewer. The Picsel viewer is a nice application, and it runs faster on the Samsung G600 than on previous handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also several other noteworthy applications. The Image Stamp application allows users to watermark their images - simply select a watermark imprint, then select the image to be watermarked. Hardly a must-have on a mobile platform, this application is obviously meant for fun mostly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yahoo! search and Yahoo! Messenger were integrated into Samsung E950, while the Samsung U700 came with Google search integration. Well, none of those is available with Samsung G600, although you will find Google search on the Samsung G800, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Samsung E950 was equipped with the Smart search application, which used to search throughout the whole handset content, such as contacts, menus, messages, etc., the Samsung G600 has a cut down version of it that only searches interactively through your contacts while you are typing a number to dial. Further on, the Smart Search activates automatically when you start dialing a number and shows you all the available contacts, which have this number combination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 is also equipped with the Mobile Tracker application, which allows you to protect your investment. The application starts secretly sending tracking messages to a number you define, in case another SIM card is put in the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another clever (to an extent!) functionality is the SOS messaging. Once you predefine an SOS message and several recipient numbers, you can send those numbers distress messages by simply pressing the volume keys several times.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gaming with the same old titles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to games, Samsung have their handsets packed with them. It's quite pleasing to see all those titles sitting in the fun corner. Unfortunately, if you've had a recent Samsung handset, the odds are you would have already seen all those games. What's more, over half of them are trial versions. But the Samsung G600 has full support for Java MDIP 2.0 so you can download additional titles and other applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The games the Samsung G600 bundles up are Cannonball, Forgotten Warrior, Freekick Festival, Archangel, Midnight Hold'em Poker (trial), Tetris Mania (trial), Minigolf Las Vegas (trial), Midnight Pool (trial), and Paris Hilton's Diamond Quest (trial).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We fear the Samsung G600 won't be able to snatch the best 5 megapixel slider recommendation off the heavyweight contenders in that form factor. However, Samsung have stirred up a really nice combination of features that would appeal to the tech savvy. Looking at the hardware side of it - it offers all the essentials and more: a quick processor, a nice 16M color TFT display, stereo Bluetooth, FM radio with recording capabilities, a TV-out port, and a 3.5 mm audio adapter combined with the highly alluring 5 megapixel camera. The G600 user interface is by far the most mature Samsung interface we've reviewed so far. The excellent web browser, the great music player, the office documents viewer and the snappy response will make users happy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We admit it's not the perfect gadget - the lack of 3G will turn down many potential buyers, while the unoriginal design we've seen over and over again won't make it stand out in the crowd of Samsung sliders on the shop windows. We guess many of you are already fed up with Samsung's lack of imagination when it comes to slider phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No offence, we still find the G600 pleasant to the eye and great to hold in hand. It's a genuine multimedia gadget from head to toe. Adding to the fact that it's the most compact and most affordable 5 megapixel cameraphone to date, the Samsung G600 looks like a great pick for this year's holiday shopping.</paragraph>
