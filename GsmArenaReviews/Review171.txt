			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel has brought the whole family to this year's MWC - two Idol 4 phones, Pixis of all sizes and even a Windows 10 hybrid laptop. The phones really like to party and have dedicated Boom button, which turns up the sound, launches the camera (and does a few other things), while the stereo speakers can work in any direction you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 4S is the company's flagship at the MWC 2016 and is made out of metal and glass. Here's what else to expect from the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the Idol 4S, the Idol 4 has the same build, but tuned down specs to match a more midrange persona.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Plus 10 is the company's first 2-in-1 device - a hybrid Windows 10 laptop with a detachable keyboard. It has an LTE hotspot... in its keyboard! (no, really)</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Idol 4S hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 4S is the company's blockbuster at this year's Mobile World Congress. The company has given the Idol 4S it's best and, as a result, the phone sports a premium build and upmarket specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the build quality, the Idol 4S features a metal frame and a duo of Gorilla Glass 3 sheets at the front and back. It weighs 149 grams but feels considerably lighter than the spec sheet suggests. Thanks to the metal frame, it feels like one of the most solid and well put together phones to come out of Alcatel. The dual 3.6W speakers are also a welcome feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.5" display is of the AMOLED variety and has a QHD resolution. As you could imagine, it is very nice to look at and with a 534ppi pixel density, it's also very crisp. However, despite the oleophobic coating, the showroom demo unit couldn't handle all the fingerprints. We'd imagine that with regular useage the smudges will be far less, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Idol 4S relies on a Snapdragon 652 chipset with a 1.8GHz quad-core Cortex-A72 and a quad-core 1.4GHz Cortex-A53 and 3GB of RAM. In our time with the unit, Marshmallow 6.0.1 was running very smoothly. We'd imagine that the performance will remain satisfactory even with a few dozen apps on the 32GB of internal storage. Don't worry, you can throw in a microSD card on the second SIM card slot to expand the storage further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether you need it or not, the Idol 4S can be used upside down - with the UI responding accordingly - as well as back to front. This means you can virtually place a call with the back of the phone in your ear, and there won't be any problems at all. If that's not enough, rotating the phone in landscape automatically enables the phone's surround sound capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting feature of the Idol 4S is its Boom Key - a dedicated physical button on the side of the phone, which has different functionality depending on the context. For example, pressing the button while in standby mode fires up the camera and takes a quick photo; press it while in the gallery and it artistically shuffles for a slideshow. While playing music on the loudspeaker, the Boom Key amps up the bass and loudness. Lastly, pressing the button while on the homescreen shows a pleasant weather animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera setup of the Idol 4S consists of a 16MP main snapper and an 8MP front-facing shooter. The main camera has a f/2.0 aperture and can record 4K video @ 30fps. The secondary camera is coupled with an LED flash and records 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we're quite pleased with our first encounter with the Alcatel Idol 4S. The company bundles a custom pair of JBL headphones ($40 retail value) with the phone. The package itself transforms into a pair of virtual reality goggles, which is insanely cool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Idol 4 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol 4 shares the same build as the more premium Idol 4S. The metal frame and Gorilla Glass 3 at the front and back feel just as nice as the phone's bigger brother.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's changed is the display, which is 5.2" IPS LCD panel with 1080p resolution and the chipset is a Snapdragon 617 with either 2GB of 3GB of RAM depending on the model. The Boom Key is here as well, as is the reversibility options and stereo speakers. Due to the smaller size, the phone is a tad lighter at 130 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back, there's a 13MP camera, which records 1080p videos, while the 8MP front-facer with LED combo from the Idol 4S is unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you're wondering, Alcatel is keeping the same packaging for the Idol 4 as the Idol 4S. Getting the phone will also get you the cool retail box that converts to a VR headset.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel Plus 10 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel showed off a Windows-powered phone at CES, now it has brought a 10" Windows hybrid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The detachable tablet has a 1,280 x 800px touchscreen with stereo speakers around it and is powered by an Intel Atom x5 chipset. The full-Windows experience is hampered by limited amounts of memory - 2GB RAM, 32GB storage (plus a microSD card, which is practically mandatory).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Windows 10 has an automatic tablet mode that switches to bigger on-screen buttons, suitable for touch operation, when you detach the keyboard. With the keyboard you can use the screen or the trackpad, but it's pretty cramped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet is built from plastic entirely. There's a flap that covers the card slot, but we found it pretty flimsy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Plus 10 features a 2MP selfie camera on the front (upper left corner) and a 5MP camera on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard has a full-size USB (plus one micro) and a microHDMI here. It also adds a second battery (2,580mAh, adding to the tablet's 5,830mAh). Alcatel says this is enough to last an 8-hour work day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all, the keyboard works as a Wi-Fi hotspot for up to 15 devices. Note that despite this functionality, the SIM card actually goes into the tablet. Speaking of connectivity, the tablet has single-band Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we didn't like about how the tablet docks to the keyboard is that the angle is not adjustable. You can plug the tablet in backwards so that the keyboard just works as a stand, but we don't see much value in that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet has an optional leather finish (fake leather, of course), but there wasn't such a unit around for us to caress.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel POP4, POP4+, and POP4S hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In keeping with traditions, Alcatel took full advantage of the MWC 2016 stage and made sure to update its POP line as well. The refreshed 2016 lineup includes three base models - the POP4, POP4+ and last, but not least, the POP4S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the most part, the line has stuck to its affordable roots and has come up with lower-specced devices. However, this year the top model in the lineup comes with a nice specs sheet, threading in mid-ranger territory. Before we dive in the specs themselves, it is also worth noting that more variations on these three core options are most likely going to appear as well at some point or another. Alcatel's current business model demands it, as it does tend to cater to carrier needs rather than end-user market and is thus highly flexible for modifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An unfortunate consequence we experienced first hand is that information printed out at the Alcatel booth was often misleading and a strange mix of various specs sheets and facts. Luckily, the press releases got everything right, so we can share our initial hands-on experiences with confidence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The central topic in the new POP 4 series is improved style and customizability. It shouldn't surprise anybody that the material of choice in the budget-friendly family is still plastic, although, to Alcatel's credit, it has tried its best to do as much as possible to refine its exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three units now have a trendy curved back design and the plastic is complete with a brushed steel effect, much like on an Asus Zenfone 2, although, admittedly feeling a lot less sturdy. Don't get us wrong, everything is nicely put together, but the units just don't appear solid and are also lighter than they appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for customizability, color plus pattern options are abundant, to say the least: Hairline-Brushed, Leather, Wood and Baby Skin, to quote a few of the available covers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the units themselves, first up, we have the POP 4. It comes with a 5-inch 720p, IPS display. It is the lowest model up inside it there is a rather underpowered quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 SoC, along with 1GB of RAM and just 8GB of onboard storage, thankfully expandable with up to 32GB more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, despite all the cost reductions, it still has Cat.4 LTE and an 8MP primary shooter plus a 5MP front-facing one, with 84.4 degrees wide-angle lens. As for the actual feel of the unit, it fits snugly in the hand and is comfortable to work with, although, as already mentioned, somewhat too light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The displays on the POP4 units are perfectly decent. Max brightness is ok and so are viewing angles. Colors, however, are somewhat washed out, and that goes for the top-end FullHD model as well, but we can't be too picky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving up in the food chain, we have the slightly upgraded POP 4+. Its display goes all the way up to 5.5 inches but has kept the same resolution. Another change is the 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. The processor, camera, battery and everything else remains the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there is the POP 4S Its footprint is quite close to its sibling's and understandably so, as it does have the same 5.5-inch display, only with FullHD resolution. The RAM amount is 2GB while storage stays the same at 16GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera setup has also been improved with a 13MP shooter on the back and the same 5MP on the front, and the battery is rated at 2960 mAh. However, it's the eight-core MediaTek MT6755M SoC and the addition of a fingerprint reader that truly set the POP 4S apart and allow it to step into in mid-ranger territory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is also worth noting that the POP4 line boots the latest Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS, but the included colorful skin does seem a bit too juvenile to our taste.</paragraph>
