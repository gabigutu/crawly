			<paragraph>The girly Samsung E530 is quite a precious device that has a lot of modern functions and is nicely made up. Almost every woman will desire it. Do you want to see why?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Mobile phones with clamshell design always had an inexpressible magic especially for the female part of the population. That's why we don't have to wonder why mobile phones' manufacturers occasionally modify some of their successful clamshells for better suit women. Mostly, the modification consists in changes of color combinations and frequently in adding of special, female related functions to the phone menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  The new Samsung E530: girls, do you like it? </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same happened with the reviewed Samsung E530. It is indistinguishable in hardware compared to the similar Samsung E720, which has arisen as good combination between the old clamshell E700 and the modern, high-end D500. We advice you to read the E720 review as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent sparkler<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung E530 is a rather good-looking clamshell phone at first sight. The rounded waveforms of the body suit well a phone without an outer antenna; at first sight it seems to be a little fatty; however, when you hold it in your hands or have it in the pocket its size is not limitative. The color combination is decent, the dark purple centre harmonize well with the purple-silver phone endings. It's a good thing that the manufacturer has abandoned the glaring red body colors, even for a phone targeted at women.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Decent purple tints suit very well to the phone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a small OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) status display on the front part of the phone, which is mounted approximately in its center. Above, you may see the megapixel camera lenses with external diode flash. Here you won't find the popular mirror for self-portrait shooting, because its function is reproduced perfectly by the status display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  A small display and a diode flash camera on the front cover </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find a combined data and power supply connector at the bottom edge of the phone, under a discreet plastic plug. There is a strap eyelet on the upper edge of the phone, which is a part of the elegant case, delivered with the phone. There is a volume control button and a microphone slot on the left side of the phone. On the opposite side of the phone you'll find a covered connector for stereophonic hands-free set - again supplied in the package. Above it you can find the camera activation button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The strap is delivered together with the phone ? the operating items on the sides</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp; The system connector is protected by a cover ? the handsfree connector, too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If left opened on the table, the phone is quite unsteady due to its oval shapes. There's no bigger area to prop at. It swings and turns around at every touch, more over, it outbalances much forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lithium-Ion battery is a direct part of the back cover, so the whole construction of the phone is solid and doesn't creak even under a stronger pressure, which is a problem with many other phones with batteries overlapped by a plastic shell. The accumulator has 800 mAh capacity, which provides the phone with enough energy for 330 minutes talk time or up to 200 hours of stand-by. The recharging cycle of the empty accumulator to its full capacity with the added travel charger doesn't take more than two hours. The information about the charging status is displayed in an interesting way: the phone itself doesn't inform you, it's the charge connector with the help of a colored light. The red light means that the phone is still charging; the green one means the opposite - full accumulator capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Look under the back cover ? the phone is relatively small ? a stylish case is delivered together with the phone - empty... ? ... with phone </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>For endless texting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The layout of the inner part of the phone is standard without big exceptions. The main color display occupies almost the whole upper part of the phone; the speaker slot is mounted above its upper edge. The lower part of the phone is divided into two imaginary parts - an alphanumeric part of the keyboard and a function part. At a glimpse, you will notice that the designers did a good job with the keyboard outer appearance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   The phone opened ? the function part of the keyboard ? the numeric part of the keyboard ? lightening of the keyboard </paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's almost amazing that the functionality is not subordinated to the appearance, but made to the highest possible level. The numeric buttons themselves are big enough for bigger fingers too, they are quite distinguishable from each other when touching them; their stroke is confident. The stroke is optimal especially for fast and precise writing. The latter applies also for the function keys, the only exception is the correction button with C symbol, which could be some a few millimeters wider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting of the keyboard is white, strong enough and rather even - only the left numeric keys gleam.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gorgeous, in one word<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main color display is active and is capable of showing 262 thousand colors with the resolution of 176 × 220 pixels. This display, faithful to the good tradition of Samsung, belongs amongst the best in its category, possessing almost every thinkable characteristics. The display image looks like a photo, the separate pixels are small enough, and the diagonal lines are not so apparently rugged. The display shows good results when reading in direct sun, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The display excels with its image quality </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The outer display also looks very fine because it is much smaller. It is manufactured by the OLED technology, which in every thinkable condition is a guarantee for very good readability. The mini display is divided into two parts: upper row with basic status information (time, date, signal strength, the remaining energy) and lower graphic part with 96 × 96 pixels resolution. The number of the displayed colors comes up to 65 thousand and the upper status line is glaring constantly without any increased energy taken from the accumulators due to the used technology.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Menu and operation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I personally like the Samsung mobile phones menu, because they have always performed well with the colors and graphics, and always remains well arranged. When working with Samsung, I always have the feeling that the colors helps me to orientate, while with other phones I think that their menu is colorful only because the manufacturer wanted to use a colorful display. Yes, the colors in the menu of some competitors are rather confusing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Stand-by display ? the main menu ? some pretty wallpapers are prepared in the phone </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left context key serves for entering the phone main menu, whereas the right ones are restricted only for entering the phonebook. You may freely change the application and function of the four-way cursor button; in the original setup it serves for initialization of writing new messages (the left key), calendar (the right key), Bluetooth (the down key) and MP3 player (the up key).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  You may choose the menu color from four variants ? you may also change the color of the numerals when dialing a new number </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nine animated icons compose the main matrix menu. The currently selected icon is enlarged and colorfully framed. You may move in the main icon menu and in the text shots by key shortcuts. Changing the color scheme of the menu could be done with the templates; the phone has four of them preinstalled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phone calls and phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The address book of Samsung E530 is traditionally multi-itemed and you may enter up to 1000 entries to the internal phone memory. I really mean multi-itemed: you may set four phone numbers, note, email, portrait picture and sound to every record. The phone may display entries from the internal phonebook together with the SIM card entries. Searching in the phonebook is quite convenient with the help of the step-by-step writing of the sequential characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Contact details ? you may sort the contacts into groups ? the contacts context menu ? fast call set up </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may sort the contacts into groups, of course. You may also set to them specific distinguishing ringtones and picture or photo. This picture displays on the whole area of the screen; the 64-channel polyphonic or MP3 music clips are used for the ringing. The produced sound is qualitative and surprisingly rich, the bass is also noticeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A selected sound may ring up when opening or closing the phone. You may reject the incoming call in closed position too; you may accept it also by opening the phone. You can adjust the volume with the side buttons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no change in messaging from Samsung E720, so we will borrow the SMS and MMS description from David Polesny's review: The device manages text messages as well as extended EMS or MMS. And of course - email client. As usual, the memory takes in up to 200 SMS. You can use the built-in T9 dictionary and divide each message into 12 shorter ones. Sign counting refers to the message as a whole; at the same time the phone shows you how many messages have already been used. Just like the D500 model, the T9 dictionary can be centrally deactivated so that it does not turn on every time you enter the SMS editor. The display offers 7 lines for writing SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Message menu ? writing SMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for creating MMS, their editor is so well organized that it could hardly confuse anyone. You are given 4 lines with descriptions and icons to gradually enter the individual message items. If you want to use optional functions, enter the context menu. Here you can preview the message or attach an additional page. A message can contain 300 KB and can have up to 10 pages. Details about the current size of the created message and its pages are given in the top part of the display. The maximum memory space for saving multimedia messages is set at 3 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client enables the user to manage maximum five accounts using the POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP protocols. Even though the client works with attachments, a message can carry no more than 250 KB of information. The number of characters for each email message is limited and should not exceed 1000, or the message will not be sent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each client has special folders where received emails are displayed. First to get downloaded are the headers, then you can download the rest of the email, incl. the attachments. The phone offers an option for leaving a copy of the email on the server as well as an option for setting the maximum size of each email that is to be downloaded. Unfortunately, the choice given is among three sizes only: 100 KB, 200 KB or 300 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option for automatic downloads with a one hour break between them, which cannot be reduced and thus may turn out to be much too long. The phone has a simple filter, which stops messages coming from forbidden addresses and from those with discarded message subjects.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera and video recorder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The built-in digital camera has a one megapixel resolution. While the older photo mobiles with VGA resolution have limited usage, Photo Call for example, the megapixel camera phones stand a comparison with the cheap classic compact cameras. Samsung E530 takes pictures in a little unusual resolution of 1152 × 864 pixels. There is also a lower resolution setting - it can be used when sending emails and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera viewfinder ? camera setup ? diode flash setup </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may select the picture quality from four different settings; it is possible to adjust the exposure compensation. Main color effects, frames and self-timer are available; you may shoot in mosaic mode (saves several photos in one frame) or multi shot mode (up to 15 frames in a sequence). You may switch on the diode flash permanently or only after the time of the exposure; you may use it as a flashlight in the darkness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample pictures: </paragraph>
			<paragraph>       </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo quality could be higher, the purple fringing and the higher noise level in most of the pictures are rather annoying. The camera has big problems with the shooting of objects at shorter distance; the sharpness of the whole picture is ok with distant objects. The digital zoom is not good for any real use considering the unsuccessful conversion algorithm. The attendant sound of the zoom is interesting - it simulates the sound of a real moving zoom lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the contrary, the quality of video recordings is high. You may record video clips in resolution of 253 x 288 or 176 x 144 pixels, which are stored in the internal phone memory (only the available memory limits the maximum size of the recording) in MPEG4 format. A matter of interest is the zoom option during recording. The quality of the video records is completely the same as the one of E720.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The MP3s are in fashion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may store music files in MP3 format to the 80MB internal memory and may listen to them while traveling. The player doesn't have buttons on the front side of the cover (like the E720 model); the playback control is not possible even with the help of the additional handsfree set. It's a pity, that the phone doesn't have an additional memory card slot, so you just can't get many pieces into the internal memory. The reason is that this memory is shared with the other phone applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The supplied headphones </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is very simple. Put the audio files to the music folder and start the playback. Subsequently, you may pause it, stop it completely, jump across a track ahead or back. In the menu you'll find a repeating option or an option for random playback; you'll find also a simple equalizer with four presets. You can switch on the 3D effect, which however distorts the sound unnaturally. You may also select from three skins for the player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The MP3 player is very simple</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player cannot run in background, so for example you can't listen to music while writing messages. The supplied headphones work quite all right, however more bass will suit better to the sound.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no change in the functions for time organization, data ability and many other additional functions; their description could be found in the last chapter of Samsung E720 review. New, however, are the functions, especially specified for the ladies. In the menu under the cleverly named item The Women's Life you'll find some really interesting applications:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar, the alarm clock and the timer are amongst the standard functions. The Java games and data functions are not forgotten either. The phone is equipped with wireless Bluetooth technology; unfortunately there is no infrared port. GPRS class 10 provides the data transmission in the GSM network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Female functions menu ? stopwatches cope also with mean times ? calendar in month preview ? alarm clock </paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Game samples</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Why don't you have it already?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung E530 is a modern phone, which belongs to the best phones that you may put in your purse. The phone inspired almost every woman to whom we showed it during the testing with its pragmatic and eye-catching appearance. I really can't think out any important limitations of this phone. So, if you are looking for a stylish phone, full of modern functions, this is the right choice.</paragraph>
