			<paragraph>The mirror-like clamshell Z610 has a magic top half and an invisible external display; it supports 3G, has a 2 megapixel camera, and has one of the most luxurious keypads ever seen on the mobile market. Memory card slot is available, of course. In other words, Sony Ericsson's portfolio has been enriched with another top-quality model.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Generally, I am not an admirer of manufacturers, who frequently release new models with the only objective to fill in their portfolio, even though these do not bring along any innovations. In this aspect, many of you may find the new Sony Ericsson Z610 a perfect example of the "no innovation" trend as in functional terms it is fully identical to the K610 model. Yet, allow me to disagree with you: no matter the fact that SE Z610 (on the market since September) is going to offer the same equipment at a price about 90 euros higher than the one of SE K610, this new SE model represents a new design philosophy and an utterly innovative construction. Compared to Z610 the forerunner Sony Ericsson K610 looks rather boring.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Magnificent illumination<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It has been a really long time since Sony Ericsson last succeeded to inject such a high dose of charisma into a mobile phone. Well, its phones have always tended to look solid and carry significant features (some of the best as to their price category). Yet, SE Z610 is more like a pretty girl you see on the street. You turn around staring when she passes you, completely ignoring her IQ. The entire front cover is glossy and therefore perfectly reflects near-by objects (have a look at the images with a key and a pair of pliers). The phone is going to be offered in three color versions - grey, blue, and pink. We have tested the least attractive grey one. According to us, turquoise blue and pink suit the phone best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    &nbsp;&nbsp;    Two more color versions</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Reflective surface looks gorgeous</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front side is dominated by the camera lens and the solid joint of phone's clamshell construction. The surface around the camera lens is curved in an attractive way breaking even the glossy plate. Yet, the most beautiful part is still to come: Sony Ericsson Z610 has an invisible OLED display, which gets activated when the phone has been closed or any side key been pressed. For the rest of the time it remains hidden behind the reflexive surface of the device. Sony Ericsson has apparently copied this interesting effect from Sony's tiny portable music players. Impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;Camera lens stands above the front surface </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The external informative display has 21 x 8 mm and resolution of 128 x 36 monochrome pixels. It is horizontal and visualizes standard details like signal strength, battery state, and time. When the phone is set to quiet profile, a canceled musical note also appears on the display; a newly received message is alerted with a tiny envelope and an arrow. Missed calls and messages cannot be displayed simultaneously as the display would not fit so many icons. That is why missed calls are always given an advantage: the above mentioned arrow turns the other way and shadows the envelope. On the outer display you could also scroll the name of the song you are currently listening to or the name of the person who is calling you. Scrolling is smooth, characters do not get blurred.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  "Invisible" OLED display is one of the greatest beauties of Sony Ericsson Z610 </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quick overlook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To be explicit, let me also mention the exact dimensions of Sony Ericsson Z610: 95 x 49 x 20 mm, 110 g. Let's now have a look at its sides: nothing on the right, nothing on the top, just a Fast-Port connector in the bottom. All external control elements are concentrated on the left side of the device. Here they are from bottom to top: a LED (untraditionally situated), which only informs you about three basic activities of the phone: interrupted green light signals that the phone is on, interrupted red light shows lack of energy, while constant red light means that the device is being charged. Unfortunately, the phone offers no light alerts of planned appointments, missed calls or received messages, which I consider to be a significant con as such helping tool should be available in any clamshell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; All-side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover of the device is flat, smooth; in a color nuance that perfectly synchronizes with the front reflexive surface. So what could you find in the back? The manufacturer's logo and the model denomination (located here for the first time); the loud speaker grill, and a connector for an external antenna protected with a rubber cap. Once you remove the back cover, you will see a Lithium-Ion battery with capacity of 950 mAh (BST-33) advertised to provide energy for up to 400 hours of stand-by or up to 420 minutes of call time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Back cover with manufacturer's logo ? loud speaker grill ? after removing the cover ? SIM card bed </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card is inserted into a bed under the battery; In SE Z610, unlike K610, there is no space for a memory card. Instead, the memory card slides into a slot with rubber cap (marked as M2) located on one of the sides, above the state diode. M2 is another name for the cards of the Memory Stick Micro type. One such card (64 MB) is enclosed in the original package, whose content is otherwise rather limited: the above mentioned memory card, a USB data cable, a CD with software, and documentation. No earphones or cleaning clothe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Slot for Memory Stick Micro </paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the last two elements on the left side of the device still waiting to be mentioned - a dual volume-control button and a play/pause button. Sony Ericsson Z610 looks pretty solid; no creaky sounds were heard during the testing process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Construction is solid </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Magnificent keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I am overwhelmed. It has been ages since I last typed on such a brilliant keypad as is the one of Sony Ericsson Z610. One sure thing is that mobile manufacturers usually install spacey keypads in clamshell models. Sony Ericsson Z610 however comes to offer an exquisite keypad design, ideal key distribution and perfect key reactions - basically all one needs for seamless and comfortable typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Keypad is extremely comfortable ? main switch-off button is untraditionally situated in the bottom </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numeric keys are spacey; they stand out a little, this way facilitating the finger to move from one key to another. The functional keys are glossy, which makes them optically stand out from the surrounding surface. The main control key has a confirming center and is generally very comfortable to manage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main four-way key with confirming center, surrounded by functional keys </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the control key you will see three keys with fixed functions. The left one runs the web browser, the middle one activates the camera, and the right one provides access to My menu. All three keys are slightly uplifted and easy to find by touch. The keypad is illuminated in white. It gets activated gradually from the display downwards every time the phone is opened or a random key has been pressed. Cool, indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Keypad backlighting </paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the part called "My shortcuts" you can create a list of all important menu items with instant access. The folder "New events" stores received but unread messages, missed calls, and alerts of events in the calendar. The next in line is the folder containing frequently browsed websites. Another excellent folder is "Running applications"; here you can manage all running Java programs (there could be three to four of them running in background simultaneously). This is what I call real multitasking - an extremely rare option to find in common mobile phones without OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is slightly bigger than the display of Sony Ericsson K750. The pity, however, is that SE has decided to stick to a basic resolution of 176 x 220 pixels and visualization of 262K colors. Both brightness and contrast are good. Besides, the black surface below the large glass of the display makes the latter look even bigger than it really is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Display ? resolution is nothing special, but looks good </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Menu with animation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main menu hides no surprises. It is a typical Sony Ericsson menu as used in many recent models. Icons are elaborated precisely; nearly every menu corner features animation. Even so, Sony Ericsson Z610 is fast. No function took it more to open or activate than one would have expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  Three built-in color schemes with animated wallpaper </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the device is on stand-by the left functional key provides access to information about calls, while the right one opens the menu. Calls are controlled through the keys located below the display (as you know it has already been some time since Sony Ericsson stopped applying the classical green and red keys). Each way of the main control key can be assigned an instant-menu function. Just on the contrary, the functions assigned to the functional keys are fixed, that is, not user-configurable. Having a huge clock appear across nearly half the display is quite nice though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone settings consist of 5 items </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having once mentioned the display and the second camera for video calls located above its top edge, let me detail video calling and its options here. Once you have selected a contact in your phonebook, you can choose whether the call you want to execute should be a standard one or a video call. In the latter case the phone reserves the down left corner of the display for the image created with the front camera (VGA resolution of 640 x 480 pixels). Here you will watch yourself. The rest of the display is occupied by the picture of the person on the opposite side. I guess some people may want to change places of the two pictures...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VGA camera for video calls </paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can zoom in the other party's image twice (by one step at a time); exposure compensation, however, is no more a subject to modification like it used to be earlier. Darkness is not a problem as the phone has a night mode. The front camera could be fully deactivated. If you feel like showing the opposite side a subject or your environment, you can switch to main-camera mode without having to interrupt your call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Video calling and its interface </paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two megapixels at every corner<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let me now pay a little bit more attention to the main camera in Sony Ericsson Z610. Its maximum resolution is 1600 x 1200 pixels, that is, 2 megapixels. Two other resolution options are available as well: 1 megapixel or VGA. There are two levels of image quality to choose between. Apart from the standard shooting mode, the camera also offers panoramic and multi-shot. Frames are available too. In the menu you will also run into more options like night mode, self-release, and white balance. The exposure compensation is controlled by moving the main key left or rightwards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera interface ? setup options ? a picture just taken ? possible modifications </paragraph>
			<paragraph>To take a picture it is necessary to hold the phone vertically. At the same time a shutter release button is missing on either of the phone's sides. Instead, shooting is executed by a press on the center of the navigation key. The camera does not have an auto-focus option. Once taken, each picture could be sent to a blog, that is you create you own photoblog - a unique service developed by Sony Ericsson in cooperation with Blogger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each picture could be accompanied by a legend and text. Publishing on Internet takes a few seconds. A single image displayed on the web is sufficient for a blog to be automatically registered. Subsequently, you will receive a SMS with inscription details allowing you to configure your already existing blog through your home computer. Of course, you could easily update your blog straight from a PC too. The entire application is simple and easy to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;A standard photo plus three color effects </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let me now get back to the camera menu. It is also vertical and seems to have maintained the same structure Sony Ericsson has been sticking to for some time now. In other words, owners of older SE models will manage to get around pretty easily. Yet Sony Ericsson has failed to resolve one weak point: when you modify the setting in one (any) part of the menu, the entire menu closes down automatically. I myself would prefer to close it manually. Now, every time I modify the camera settings (implies changes of more than one item), I need to enter the menu once again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Sample photos in full resolution (click to enlarge)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images Sony Ericsson Z610 takes could hardly be compared - as to quality - to those taken with the best cameraphones. They are not bad, but cannot compete with the champs. Saturation becomes far too intensive under favorable light conditions. In result, images look pretty attractive, but less natural. As soon as you find yourself surrounded by less or worse light, the small camera sensor creates significant and quite unpleasant noise. Details of a bit farther situated objects come out especially poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera of SE Z610 does not feature a macro mode, so anything located at 80 or less cm from the lens comes out blurred. The camera has a double digital zoom, which only creates crops and is thus only applicable in the lowest possible resolution. Video is not even worth mentioning as it comes in handy for use in MMS only. Just think about it: what else would you manage with QCIF (176 x 144) resolution? When a video is being shot, the phone offers you the option to automatically limit record's duration so it can be subsequently inserted in a MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Text came out pretty poor </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User friendly file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file manager used in Sony Ericsson Z610 belongs among those best on the market (in the category of phones without OS). It allows you to select files (single or multiple), copy them, move them; it also creates or deletes folders according to user's will. The manager is divided into three basic parts - one for files in the phone memory, another one for the files stores on the memory card, and a third one that combines the files from the former two parts all together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Three items in the file manager </paragraph>
			<paragraph>I used the manager to try to find out the exact capacity of the internal memory of SE Z610, about which the manufacturer makes no official statement. The result is 20 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Visualization of each of the submenu views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Work with images is intuitive. They could be dealt with in the form of either a mere list, or a list with previews. The name of the respective file is visualized in any case. The date it was made gets displayed in the list with previews only. The phone also offers a visualization of 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 matrix with images, where file names remain invisible. Work with videos is quite similar. Each image preview could be zoomed-in up to 32 times.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Small, but important hint<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has not made any modifications in the phonebook: it fits in 1000 contacts, each of which can be assigned a total of 28 fields, or namely: three email addresses, a picture, a ringing melody, a company name, a complete street address, a birth date etc. At typing these details the phone will ask you whether you would like them to be copied and pasted into the calendar. There is one unpleasant hint though: the above mentioned 1000 contacts could contain no more than 2500 phone numbers in total. In other words, the phonebook would not fit a single number over this amount. Numbers and emails belonging to one contact can be browsed through the use of the horizontal ways of the navigation key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Five fields to go with each contact </paragraph>
			<paragraph>SE Z610 will also ask you whether you want to browse the contact list on the SIM card or the one stored in the phone. Browsing both at the same time is not possible. Searching is done through gradual typing of the initial letters of the desired contact's name. Each name could be accompanied by a picture and a specific ringtone (not applicable in the case of contact groups). Groups could be used as call filters or for sending SMS. Their amount is not limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SE Z610 can alert you of incoming calls with 72-voice polyphony melodies. Sound is superb. The phone supports both MP3 and AAC formats. In addition, the phone has a built-in composer for creating your own music. Call service is perfect: ringing can be silenced without call rejection, microphone can be deactivated; conference calls are available too. If you need to make a record of a particular call, feel free to use all available free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound records are only limited by the available free memory </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slightly different message font<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The message editor works with SMS, EMS, instant messages and MMS as well as with emails. SMS are written on 5 lines en bloc; font has been slightly modified since SE K750: it is bold and perfectly readable even for users with poorer sight. T9 is reliable as usual. Besides, you can deactivate it completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Message editor ? SMS ? work with messages and their settings </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Characters get counted down (the last 20 ones) shortly before a message or sub-message is completed. Each message could be divided into up to 10 sub-messages, each of which is indicated by the editor. MMS may contain text, an image, an audio and a video record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time organization in Sony Ericsson Z610 is nearly perfect. Its calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. There is only one event type. Which day the week should start with is up to you. Accomplished tasks can be marked off. Stopwatch and countdown are available, of course. The only application you may miss here is a measure and currency converter (not a part of phone's simple calculator either). Sony Ericsson Z610 synchronizes in a way similar to SE K600, SE K610 and their forerunners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete organizer menu ? typing a new entry ? month view of the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Week view ? view of a particular day ? event details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  There could be four alarm clocks; each of them could be attached a picture and a text</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Stopwatch ? simple calculator (does not respect the rules of mathematic operations)</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretending that EDGE does not exist<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both WAP and web sites are easy to access. The phone transfers data through GPRS Class 10. As to EDGE, it appears that Sony Ericsson from time to time recognizes its existence (see for example the K790 model), and from time to time decides to ignore it (like in this case). The most convenient, of course, is fast UMTS, as long as the network supports it . The phone has a well elaborated WAP browser, which can also open simple html pages (in landscape mode too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Built-in Internet browser features plenty of options (zoom, landscape mode, etc.) </paragraph>
			<paragraph>For close-range communication the mobile can use either Bluetooth or the USB data cable enclosed in the original package. The phone also supports the standard function Mass Storage. The Infrared port seems to have gone away. The original package also contains an installation CD including all necessary drivers and applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A crucial extra for Sony Ericsson Z610 is its music player. The player opens and plays all music files available in the phone memory. If you prefer to create playlists of your own, there is no problem. The player reads details from ID3 tags. When it is minimized, however, and a new song starts, it does not display any information about it in the top part of the display. Repeat and shuffle as well as sound modification through an equalizer are available too. The phone has the famous MegaBass preset. In a result, the bass elements get perfectly expressed, while highs and middles rather disappear. Sony Ericsson Z610 does not have a FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;Player is elaborated in Walkman style typical for Sony Ericsson ? playing in background </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Do you find me attractive?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Z610 is an ideal decoration for both your conference and home table. Be sure that its illuminated "invisible" display will make everybody around watch your phone with intensified interest. At the same time, it is a user-friendly phone, which will help you organize your time pretty successfully even if you are into "serious business".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Z610 will provide you with 3G support, a standard 2 megapixel camera, a music player, and a Memory Stick Micro card slot. Not a bad offer, don't you think? I am just a bit reluctant about the absence of EDGE and Infrared port. The dust-covered camera lens (a consequence of the lack of protection) and the rather unnecessary state diode in one of the phone's corners won't probably excite users either.</paragraph>
