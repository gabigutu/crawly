			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 640 XL is one of Miscrosoft's recently announced Lumias and it's also available as a Dual SIM model, which we're reviewing. It's the best equipped smartphone in the Lumia 640 series - it packs a massive 5.7" screen and a 13MP camera. The Lumia 640 is ready to capture new users for Microsoft's mobile platform by offering a smooth smartphone experience on big screen, all with a tantalizing sub-200 euro price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia was well known for its rich lineup of phones, where everyone could find their dream phone. In the new smartphone era the diversity applied mostly to the color options, but today Microsoft is revisiting the past traditions with the new Lumia 640 series, which offers seven different handsets with attractive specs and bargain pricing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Breaking a pattern is a tough move today, but it seems Microsoft got it right for the most part. You can get a Lumia 640 in a regular 5" size or a 5.7" XL flavor. There are 3G, 3G Dual SIM, LTE and even LTE Dual SIM version of each size, which is very nice - you can opt for the one you need and save some cash in the meantime. And, of course, the paintjob options are as rich as they get - matte cyan, glossy cyan, orange, black, matte white and glossy white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we got the 3G Dual SIM model of the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL, one with a matte white panel. It is noticeably big, but feels really light, the Glance screen greets you at start and the ZEISS logo highlights the rear 13 MP camera. The 5.7" 720p display isn't offering the best pixel density, but it makes up for it with the ClearBlack technology. And while the Lumia 640 series was introduced as the first Windows 10 smartphones, they are still running on Windows Phone 8.1. They will be the first phones on the queue to get the update this summer though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 640 XL has pretty much all bases covered. The Snapdragon 400 chipset is our major concern. It proved a really powerful platform for the Windows smartphones in the past and is still utilized by many. But Microsoft's recent push of new apps and games within the Windows Store may finally raise performance issues on these kind of smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a quick roundup of the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL you can check out our video review. It will give you an aggregated view of our written review and if you want the complete picture you can read on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coming up next is our unboxing and the inspection of the phone's hardware.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Lumia 640 XL<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lumia 640 XL comes in a big and heavy box, but it offers very little in terms of content. In addition to the Lumia itself, you get only a single-piece 750mA charger. There is no USB cable or a headset included, of course that may as well vary according to the region.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lumia 640 XL 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Lumia 640 XL measures 157.9 x 81.5 x 9mm and weighs 171g. This means the phone is about half a centimeter shorter and narrower and 40g lighter than the biggest Lumia there is - the 6" 1520 model. And the Lumia 1520 is a slab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are not sure if it's just us, but we're slowly warming for the 5.5-inch screen form factor and the Lumia 640XL was a breeze to handle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There isn't much place for innovation when it comes to a mid-range Lumia. Microsoft isn't keen on experimenting with the design as millions of people are already familiar with the iconic Lumia shell and can pick it among others in a heartbeat. That's why Lumia 640 XL looks like any other Lumia really - a plastic removable rear cover and a black glossy piece of Gorilla Glass 3 shield.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose from a plethora of color options for the rear cover and you can always buy new ones, when you get tired of yours. Some of the colors are even offered in matte and glossy finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.7" 720p IPS display is of the ClearBlack variety and its borders are almost invisible under the black glass when it's off or even when using the Glance screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the entire back is removable, it clicks nicely into place and it fits perfectly. It doesn't move and there are no unpleasant squeaks or creaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 640 XL may weigh about 170 g, but it feels really light, probably because of its huge footprint. The matte white version we had fits well in hand and isn't prone to smudges, but we suspect the glossy models will be an entirely different story. Sure, handling isn't perfect with such a big phone, but it's as good as it can get. The phone feels light, the matte version provides good enough grip and that's pretty much all we can ask for in a 5.7" phablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 640 XL front is all pitch black and has no controls. The earpiece is above the display as is the 5MP selfie camera. A bunch of hidden sensors are also around. Below the screen you could notice a small pinhole for the primary mic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing on the left, while on the right we find the volume rocker and the lock/power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Lumia 640 XL has the audio jack, while the microUSB port is centered at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the 13MP ZEISS lens is at the back accompanied by a LED flash and the loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping the battery cover reveals the battery itself - it's removable. Unfortunately, you can't swap either SIM cards or the microSD one on the go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 640 XL packs a 5.7" ClearBlack IPS display of 720 resolution. The pixel density of 259ppi provides reasonable sharpness and the image quality is good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are very punchy and viewing angles are decent. Although we found the blacks and pixel density of the Lumia 640 XL to be only average, we should note that the contrast is very good and the screen is brightness at 100% is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone did excellent in our sunlight legibility test, meaning you'll have no problem seeing what's on the screen when taking it outside, even in the brightest sunny days.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has supplied the Lumia 640 XL will its proprietary Color Profile app that lets you tune the saturation and color balance to your liking. The Display settings also include a dedicated Brightness settings, where can tune the brightness levels for the three default profiles Windows Phone offers - Low, Medium and High. We found this particularly useful.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM is powered by a 3,000 mAh battery. According to the official stats it should be enough for about a day 3G talks and 39 days on stand-by. Naturally, we've ran it through our battery test and the results are in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery tests include dedicated measurements for web browsing, calls, video playback. The Lumia 640 XL Dual SIM managed an overall rating of 74 hours, which means it will last three days if you do an hour each of watching videos, browsing the web and making calls each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also did our standby test with just one SIM card active, but oddly we found there is no change in the standby endurance and thus in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our routine also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 640 XL has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and quad-band 3G with HSDPA. The Dual SIM model, as ours, supports dual standby. You can also opt for an LTE-enabled version, as well as LTE Dual SIM model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of local connectivity, it offers dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 4.0, with file transfer support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wallet app also uses NFC connectivity. Unfortunately, we won't know whether that has any potential to expand beyond its out-of-the-box functionality for at least a few more months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is still useful for file sharing and it works across other platforms with NFC support. Sending a picture to a Samsung phone, for instance, wasn't a problem and the same goes for web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC also plays nice with some cool accessories - like the JBL PowerUp speaker that automatically starts playing when you place the Lumia 640 XL on it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tiled user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 640 XL is running the latest available Windows Phone 8.1 out of box. The latest Lumia Denim software expansion package comes pre-installed, too. The Lumia 640 lineup was introduced together with the Windows 10, but the new OS isn't ready yet for commercial release. Microsoft promises the Lumia 640 smartphones, including the XL we are reviewing today, to be the first to get the Windows 10 firmware update though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest release of Windows Phone 8.1 offers folder support, better organized settings menu, customizable snooze alarms, more powerful Cortana and expanded reach, among other optimizations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iconic Glance Screen is available on the Lumia 640 XL, featuring some cool features. In addition to showing just the clock, it also supports notifications - the same ones you've configured to show on your lockscreen. The Glance Screen is basically a monochrome representation of your lockscreen. You can opt for the Glance to be always on, timing out after predefined interval, or to light up when you pick up the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen itself looks the same as the Glance screen, but with colors. Double tap to wake and additional unlocking security measures are available as options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar interface with resizable live tiles is your Start page, you can group tiles into folders if you like. Almost every app within the Store comes with its own tile and you can see useful info live at your homescreen. Tile background is available and while it looks great, but still, not all live tiles are transparent, which can detract from the overall effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Center is your place for four customizable toggles and all notifications in Windows. It works just like on Android OS - you access it by pulling down from the top of the screen, dismiss all notifications key is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft likes Apple's way of handling apps running in background - most of the apps are suspended upon hitting the Windows key and will be resumed once you bring them back. There are others, of course, such as Navigation, Cortana and Battery apps, which will continue to run in background unless you specifically kill them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quiet Hours mode is Windows Phone's Do Not Disturb feature - it can be set to block calls and messages over pre-defined time interval, plus it can also go on automatically during events you have marked in your calendar. Naturally, exceptions are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's Cortana is available on every Windows (8+) smartphone already. It does what Apple's Siri and Google Now do - it recognizes your voice commands and questions in natural human language and provides voice feedback. Cortana can fully interact with your phone and carry out all kind or commands related to it. Cortana can also track various news topics, makes suggestions for cooking and dinner, plan trips, find places, and even make jokes, among other things.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Lumia 640 XL is powered by the widely used but now dated Snapdragon 400 chipset. It has four Cortex-A7 processor cores clocked at 1.2GHz, Adreno 305 graphics common for most of the Windows Phone gang and 1GB RAM. The chipset is a staple in low-end Android phones - we consider it the minimum for proper smartphone user experience. Under Windows Phone it's even better, as the OS has been carefully optimized to run on that specific hardware. Still, it's not a powerhouse and you can clearly see a performance advantage in Windows Phone with better chipsets - of course, they do cost more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AnTuTu for Windows Phone rates the Lumia 640 XL much like the rest if its Snapdragon 400 siblings - the Lumia 830 and 735.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran the JavaScript-centric Kraken benchmark and the compound BrowserMark 2.1 on the Internet Explorer 11 browser. Unfortunately, the Internet Explorer browser isn't on par with today's mobile competition - it isn't even close to Chrome and Safari. Oddly enough, our real life impressions of the speed of the web browser are more than positive so don't let that low benchmark score put you off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 640 XL won't be topping any charts, but it's not meant to anyway. It was never supposed to compete at benchmarks, instead they focus on smooth, hassle-free and rich Windows experience. It's the real-world performance that matters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, the Lumia 640 XL offers a lag-free experience and didn't stutter in every day usage. Some of the more heavy apps opened with a slight delay, but that's about as slow as the phone gets. The Lumia 640 XL offers pleasing performance that would be more than enough for non-power users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and contact management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the phonebook that you'll find on any Windows Phone device. It supports multiple accounts, including social ones, and has multiple pages like the rest of the WP interface. The first page is your contacts list, the second one is What's New with all of your friends' social updates, then come (chat) Rooms, and Groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the People app, viewing a single contact also allows you to check this specific person's social updates plus you can view the complete history of exchange with this contact in one place, displayed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each SIM card has separate Phone and Messaging apps, so there is very little chance that you accidentally use the wrong SIM. The People Hub offers a comfy switch to each number, so you can easily choose the card you wish to initiate the call from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 640 XL scored a Good mark. The loudspeaker isn't the loudest around and you should keep in mind that you may miss few calls or notifications in louder environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In Windows Phone 8.1 the Photo Hub has lost the magazine UI in favor of the traditional WP page view. You get three swipe-able pages - all, albums and favorites - all pretty much self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Automatic OneDrive backup is available, you just need to enable it from the settings. Microsoft gives you 30GB for free plus 3GB for the each device on which you turn on the automatic OneDrive camera upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Music player in Windows Phone 8.1 uses the familiar page layout - you get Now Playing page; Collection view with shortcuts to artists, albums, songs, genres, playlists, and Music Store highlights. It also allows you to create, edit and delete playlists straight from your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player is compatible with your Xbox Music account and can stream your songs if you have active connection without saving them on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Music app doesn't support FLAC playback. Equalizer options are available from Settings -&gt; Audio. You can either user presets or customize your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio with RDS support on board the Lumia 640 XL. You can use the loudspeaker for the FM radio, though you still need the headset connected as it doubles as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is a separate app called Video. It has a four-page layout - your collection, movie store, TV store and spotlight. It supports XviD, DivX, MOV, WMV and H.264 videos up to 1080p resolution. It won't play videos using the AC3 audio codec though (often found in MKV containers). There is a limited subtitles support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is very good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Microsoft Lumia 640XL did well when plugged into an active external amplifier, showing very clean output. Its volume levels are above average, rounding up a solid overall performance here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance with headphones was pretty solid too - volume levels drop slightly but still remain decent, while stereo crosstalk rises, but is not much worse than average. It's not the best performance we've seen, but it should please the majority of users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Very good 13MP camera with ZEISS lens<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Lumia 640XL comes with a 13MP auto-focus camera, coupled with an LED flash though it lacks a dedicated camera key. The Lumia camera interface is very familiar - it offers white balance, focus, ISO, shutter speed up to 4s and exposure settings. You can choose between 13MP 4:3 mode and 10MP 16:9 samples, there are no other resolution options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, you can get more camera functionality via Lenses, such as Cinemagraph (animated photos), Panorama, Refocus, Selfie, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP images taken with the Lumia 640 XL turned out quite good, with reasonable amount of resolved detail. Contrast is good as is the color rendering, although sometimes the white balance is off. Noise can be somewhat of an issue - even in daylight but we are happy with the overall processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, here is are 5MP shots snapped with the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of 13MP sharpshooters these days, so the Lumia 640 XL camera isn't something special even on a mid-range smartphone. It does very well when it comes to resolved detail, the colors are nicely warm, but sometimes the white balance is off. Notice the pinkish spot on the ISO chart, too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 640 XL camcorder can record video at 1080p@30fps, with a solid 17Mbps bitrate and an solid 30fps. Sadly, videos are recorded in a single channel AAC mode with a 160Kbps bitrate and 48KHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is pretty much the same as the still camera. It offers only white balance and manual focus settings, and also allows you to choose the audio bass filter (off, 100 Hz or 200 Hz). Opting for 200 Hz (Strong) will capture much better sound in concerts or clubs where the sound is overwhelmingly loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In video recording, the Lumia 640 XL performs similarly to its still photography shooting chops. White balance is off and the dynamic range could be better. The level of detail is decent, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 30s sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 640 XL is ready to stand up against the competition in our video comparison tool. Its page will give you information on what to look for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer 11 is the newest version of the Microsoft's mobile web browser. It supports private browsing, Reader mode, unlimited tab support, tab and bookmark sync across devices, among others. Back and Forward iOS-like gestures work too - just swipe from the left or right edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document/Excel/PowerPoint viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. OneDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through OneDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's OneNote note making tool comes preinstalled as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All other organizing tools are available at first run - there are Calendar, Alarms, Calculator and Weather apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's Travel, Sports, Finance, Food &amp; Drinks and News apps are available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Lumia 640 XL you get a few Lumia exclusive apps - Storyteller interactive diary, Creative Studio for advanced photo enhancements, and, of course, HERE Maps and HERE Drive+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Drive+ offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation anywhere in the world. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone's traditional Games app is present - it carries over many features from the similar Xbox profile - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. It is also your gaming hub - here you can find all of your pre-installed games, spotlight news and store links.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Windows Phone now features a dedicated and feature-rich file manager. It's called Files, developed by Microsoft and you can get it for free from the Store.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Lumia 640 XL 3G Dual SIM is one of the seven newly introduced Lumia 640 smartphones. It's the bigger model offering massive 5.7" screen estate and higher resolution camera. If you are keen on the phablet class, you'll find the Lumia 640 XL very likable with great grip and solid construction. We'd recommend the matte flavors as the glossy materials compromise both the handling and looks. The removable rear cover and battery come as a nice bonus, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are lots of Lumia smartphones already, so why choose the Lumia 640 XL particularly? First - it will get the Windows 10 update this summer before all other Lumia phones. Then - it comes with a very capable 13MP camera with a ZEISS lens. There is also the expandable storage, the big screen and the great battery life. And last, but not least important - you can get it in 3G, LTE, 3G Dual SIM or LTE Dual SIM version and by choosing the right model you can save some cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone, soon to be replaced by Windows 10 for Phones, is getting better by the day. We've already spent some times with the Windows 10 Technical Preview and the upcoming update looks very promising and a huge step in the right direction. And it surely helps to be among the first to get it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 640 XL isn't the fastest around and its Snapdragon 400 chipset will be probably discontinued by Qualcomm soon. But Windows is quite lightweights and it's optimized specifically for this hardware so the performance is hiccup free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like the idea behind the Lumia 640 lineup, but the XL model is too big for you, there is the smaller 5" Lumia 640 flavor. It lowers the camera resolution down to 8MP, but you can also get it in 3G, LTE and dual SIM models. Naturally, it's cheaper than the Lumia 640 XL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE ? Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE Dual SIM ? Microsoft Lumia 640 Dual SIM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Lumia 535 is another 5" Windows smartphone, available in dual-SIM version as well. It has less capable hardware and camera, but halves the price, which makes it one of the most affordable yet powerful offers out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Microsoft Lumia 535 ? Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want a much smaller version of the Lumia 640 XL, you can opt for the OLED-packing Lumia 730/735 model. It matches the Lumia 640 XL hardware, but comes with a smaller 4.7" 720p OLED screen with Retina-like pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia Lumia 730 Dual SIM ? Nokia Lumia 735</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi Note and Redmi Note 4G are two great models with snappy hardware and big 5.5" IPS 720p displays. Both models match the chipset and camera department of the Lumia 640 XL, run on the beautiful MIUI on top of Android KitKat, and cost almost half the price. If you aren't into Windows that much and you are on a shoestring budget, you should keep an eye for the Redmi Note and Redmi 4G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Xiaomi Redmi Note ? Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The beautiful Lenovo A7000 comes in lively paintjobs too. It packs a 5.5" IPS HD display, runs on a powerful MT6752m chip with an octa-core processor and has double the RAM and matches the battery capacity. The A7000 has Android Lollipop pre-installed and ticks all the boxes a modern Android smartphone should cover. The Lenovo A7000 is LTE and dual SIM enabled and costs a few euros less than the Lumia 640 XL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Lenovo A7000</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 costs the same as the Lumia 640 XL and matches its hardware package but greatly disappoints in camera quality. Its highlight is the front LED flash accompanying the selfie camera, but as we found out - its image quality isn't on par with the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia C3 ? Sony Xperia C3 Dual</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Meizu m1 note comes with a punchy 5.5" 1080p display, a much powerful 8-core 64-bit processor, more RAM, double the storage and a better camera. It has LTE connectivity, as well as dual-SIM support and runs on the feature rich Flyme OS based on Android KitKat. It costs about the same as the Lumia 640 XL, which we are reviewing but offers much more hardware oomph for the.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Meizu m1 note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Lumia 640 XL - Dual SIM, 3G or LTE - isn't without competition and it isn't winning everywhere. It keeps focus on the important stuff as usual - user experience, camera quality, satisfactory battery life and feature/app rich operating system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 640 XL is definitely another precise project by Microsoft, which is targeted properly, executed excellently and priced reasonably right at launch. Windows Phone however still lacks the momentum of Android and we sure hope Windows 10 will take the mobile platform on the next level, or Microsoft will have no other option but keep selling its smartphones at bargain basement prices to keep the whole mobile endeavor afloat.</paragraph>
