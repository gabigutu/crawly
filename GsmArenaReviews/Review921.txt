			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's that time of year again and Apple's in the usual record-breaking mood at the box-office. This is an S year in the Cupertino calendar but different enough - it may be that two phones instead of one account for almost double last year's record sales. We can only guess as to which one contributed how, but this is hardly the point. We have the latest flagship reporting for duty and it will be both the main course and the desert, considering the 5c didn't quite impress as an appetizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with every "S" version of the iPhone the changes are subtle but not illusory. There's no new design obviously, no bigger screen or a bump in resolution - nothing to go against the conservative grain of how Apple typically delivers iPhone upgrades every other year. That said, it's not this phone's fault that the iPhone 5 wasn't the full-digit upgrade everyone was hoping for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual with Apple - we need to give it that - a certain set of users just can't wait to get the next big thing. Others, though, won't just get rid of the iPhone 5 unless the newcomer is convincing enough. An iPhone may fail to meet the (usually over-inflated) expectations but it has never been a product to be displeased with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new OS version may be a decider as well, if more people share our experience and feel the slowdown on an iPhone 5 running iOS 7, but the rest of the new stuff may as well be just enough to tip the scales in favor of the iPhone 5s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing that makes a tangible difference is Touch ID, with a fingerprint scanner having made the iconic Home button its residence. The camera has a bigger sensor and dual LED flash, and gladly takes advantage of what's probably the most notable improvement - the 64-bit A7 chip. The iOS enters its 64-bit stage in its seventh iteration, well ahead of the competition. What this means is better memory management and more complex tasks and apps ahead. This could as well be the first step to bringing the iOS closer to Apple's dedicated desktop OS X - an early message that both platforms are due for a rendezvous eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s pushes the major re-design another year back - but this is something we can live with. After all, the styling of the iPhone is still relevant - to say the least. Digging a little deeper reveals that Apple has taken good care of bringing many major facets of performance to a new level on its latest flagship. The processor, the camera, Touch ID, video recording and still imagery, low light performance, and naturally, the look and feel of iOS 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However many things are still annoying about the iPhone - many, if not all, repeating themselves years on end. We like the premium compact and lightweight body of the iPhone but perhaps Apple is running out of excuses in terms of screen size and resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's what makes the next point even more agonizing - the price. Apple tax or not, the iPhone 5s is more expensive than any of the competition's flagships, and by a good margin too. The bottom line is Apple is charging more and delivering less: a smaller screen, lower resolution, less storage. Oh well. Who can blame them if they can get away with it? Scratch that - make an art of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, an iPhone has always been more than the sum of its specs. But we're going to do the math anyway. Starting with the hardware, which may look similar but not without some noteworthy changes. Let's go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iPhone 5s retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s comes in a retail box that's exactly the same as the iPhone 5's from last year in terms of size and shape. Our Space Grey unit came in a white box, whereas last year's Black model came in a matching-color packaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The box contents haven't changed either - you get the Apple lightning USB cable, an A/C adapter, EarPods headset with volume controls and microphone in their separate box and the SIM tray eject tool. There are a bunch of leaflets and, for the first time since the iPhone 4, Apple has thrown in two stickers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 5s 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s has kept the exact same dimensions and weight as the iPhone 5. At 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6mm and 112 g, it's probably the most compact premium smartphones in the market. Just not sure this is the compliment it appears to be, considering what kind of screen size and resolution qualifies as premium these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Four inches of screen diagonal is what the iPhone 5 also has, the build and finish being the same too. Obviously there was room for the new processor, bigger battery and camera sensor, along with the new fingerprint scanner, in the old iPhone body.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of the iPhone 5s, like with every S version in the iPhone lineup, hasn't changed dramatically. And we'll say it again - it doesn't need to. The most prominent change are the color options - the White Silver option is the only one that looks identical to the iPhone 5 - the Black of old is now Space Grey, which is a much lighter hue, which contrasts nicely with the dark strips top and bottom. And, there's the brand new Gold option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The True Tone flash, which is essentially a dual LED flash, and the home button doubling as a fingerprint scanner are the only other differences over last year's flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple prides itself on the immaculate build of its flagship iPhone and this year's model is simply the next installment in the premium category. Every detail has been carefully considered and crafted so as to deliver the impressive 112g of weight. The front is entirely covered in Corning Gorilla Glass, with cutouts for the earpiece and home button only. The sapphire crystal and stainless steel-framed Touch ID button looks very subtle on the iPhone 5s face, contributing to an almost uniform glass surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two black strips of glass frame the aluminum plate around back. The aluminum is matte and feels grippy enough. It proudly features the iconic logo and the iPhone inscription, in contrasting mirror-glass surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the iPhone 5s is missing, compared to the iPhone 5 is a black paint job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the iPhone 5s is a pleasure, which is hardly any news. It's built to the highest standards and has a premium feel that few can even hope of matching. The screen size is the only thing that out of line with current trend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There a numbered few smartphones in the market that come close to the iPhone 5s in terms of build quality and finish. The HTC One comes to mind with its curvaceous, yet uncompromisingly cool aluminum back. Sony's Xperia Z1 has the steel frame to compliment the front and rear glass panels but it feels huge compared to Apple's latest gadget.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Most of the front is taken up by the 4" Retina display, with the resolution of 640 x 1136 pixels breaking down to 326ppi. It's a LED-backlit IPS LCD, but more on that in the dedicated display chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the screen sits the good old, but actually brand new, Home button with Touch ID. The fingerprint scanner is essentially a CMOS sensor, which takes pictures of your fingerprint in 500ppi, processed by the A7 chip. Underneath is the familiar home button. A double press will launch the task switcher, while a press and hold will fire up Siri.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen sit the usual earpiece and a new iSight camera. Inside the earpiece Apple has placed a dedicated third microphone, which is used in voice recognition. The front-facing camera features a BSI sensor and larger pixels, but is still stuck on 1280 x 960 stills and 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch ID sensor is covered with a capacitive layer under the sapphire crystal, which meets your finger. The button is encircled by a stainless steel frame accent that matches the phone's color option - in this case black to go with the surrounding glass surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the usual three buttons: volume up, volume down and a Mute toggle. The latter is rather stiff, which makes is pretty hard to operate with one hand, even though it's located in a way to comfortably fall under your finger. Then again, probably that was required to prevent accidental pushes, which can potentially result in missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right you find the tray, which pops open to reveal the nanoSIM slot. The fact that you need a pin to operate it is hardly ideal, though, particularly if you need to exchange SIM cards on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the iPhone 5s hosts nothing but the power/lock button - no fancy IR blasters for remote control of various appliances here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features the lightning port in the center, the 3.5 mm headphone jack to the left along with the main microphone and single speaker nestled under micro-drilled holes that form two grilles. Apple is using its familiar proprietary screws here so you'll need to get the appropriate pentalobe screwdriver to undo them if you're into to repairing your device at home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lightning cable that comes with the iPhone 5s (iPhone 5, 5c, 4th-gen iPad and the iPad mini) features an authentication chip so don't go thinking you'd be able to buy just any third party replacement cheaper and use it for backing up or syncing your iPhone 5s - it's not guaranteed to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lightning end of the cable can be inserted either face up or down into the iPhone 5s, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we come to the back of the iPhone 5s. The most notable change, visually at least, is the dual LED flash. It features one white and one amber-colored LED, which in combination should favor more natural skin tones when shooting with a flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the new iSight camera. It has seen a sensor increase of about 15% - 1/3" up from 1/3.2" - without affecting the resolution. It's 8MP, just as before, but the pixel size has been increased from 1.4 Âµm to 1.5Âµm, meaning in theory each pixel will gather in more light due to its larger size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To help increase the light intake Apple has also increased the aperture from f/2.4 to f/2.2, while sticking with a 5 element lens.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple decided that the 4" Retina from last year is still good enough by 2013 standards. The screen is an IPS LED-backlit LCD with a resolution of 640 x 1136 and 326ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple are using the same display two years in a row, and it will sure want us to take it as a statement, a refusal to give in to the screen size craze. It may have a point as far as screen resolution goes. The iPhone 5s has more than enough of it for this kind of size. But 4 inches of diagonal doesn't quite cut it anymore, not in the premium segment, where power users and heavy multimedia consumers shop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we're not saying that Apple needs to cross the 5" barrier but are pointing instead to manufacturers like Motorola, which managed to squeeze a 4.7" screen in a device that's not significantly taller or wider than an iPhone 5s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least some of the space above and below the screen seems wasted. The LG G2, in comparison, has side bezels half the size, while the top and bottom of the 5.2" device are still slimmer. We are not talking proportions either - the iPhone is lagging in terms of absolute values and that takes away a bit of the premium feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display matrix of the iPhone 5s is exactly the same as the one on the iPhone 5 and 5c. There are red, green and blue pixels in a straight line and equal size. Here goes the matrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple iPhone 5s ? Apple iPhone 5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The differences between an iPhone 5s and an iPhone 5 are almost non-existent in the screen department. The black levels are pretty much on par. The brightness seems a little lower on the iPhone 5s and the same goes for contrast but the differences are almost imperceptible to a naked eye and could be a result of some tweaks in the iOS 7 software, compared to iOS 6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For all purposes practical the iPhone 5s screen can be considered identical to that of the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as sunlight legibility goes, due to the slightly lower brightness the iPhone 5s falls a little short of its predecessor. However the contrast in direct sunlight remains excellent, and better than that of its direct rivals.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The battery inside the iPhone 5s is of slightly higher capacity, in view of the new 64-bit A7 processor. Last year's iPhone 5 went with 1440mAh, whereas this year we find a 1560mAh unit inside the iPhone 5s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're be still digging into the iPhone 5s' real-life battery performance but Apple promises the same exact numbers as last year - 250 hours of stand-by, 10 hours talk time on 3G, 8 hours of browsing on 3G and 10 hours on LTE and Wi-Fi. We'll update this page with the results when our test completes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 5s and iOS 7: a match made in heaven<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5s runs buttery smooth with iOS 7, a major overhaul to the user interface with brand-new flat looks, transparent menus and keyboard, new system icons and apps, new control center and much more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we continue, here is a quick video demonstration of the new iOS 7 running on the iPhone 5s:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 looks a lot different compared to its predecessors, but its logic of operation is mostly the same. All of your apps are on the homescreen, folders are available and there is the familiar dock that can take up to four shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All system icons are different though: the clock now has an animated icon showing the current time, the system fonts have been altered, and there are lots of semi-transparent elements and new gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start from the beginning - the lockscreen. It's totally different and yet it works in a very similar way. The slide to unlock bar is now gone and you can swipe anywhere on the screen to unlock your iPhone 5s. The text is somewhat illogically placed right above the tiny arrow for the control center which points up, but you actually still need to slide to the right to access the homescreen. The swipe might've worked both ways, left too, but that's not the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different unlock methods for you to choose from. One that is unique to the iPhone 5s is TouchID (more on that in a minute), but there's also the classic 4-digit passcode. If that's too insecure for your taste, you can also opt for a custom passcode. This will bring you a text field where you can enter a virtually limitless security combination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen also has the camera shortcut at the bottom, you can swipe up from there for quick access to the camera app. A double press of the Home key will bring up the multimedia controls as usual. Lockscreen notifications are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can notice two transparent arrows at the top and the bottom of the lockscreen. Swiping from the top down will display Notifications, while swiping up from the bottom will bring up the new Control Center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen out of the way reveals the revamped homescreen. The Spotlight pane is now gone - but not lost. It's just triggered by a new pull-down gesture anywhere on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders are available as usual, but there is no limit any more to how many apps you can put inside them. Pages are available in the folders, each page can pack up to nine apps and there is no limit on the page count. And you can finally put the Newsstand app away in a folder! Hallelujah!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opening and closing of folders is now accompanied by a cool animation. These take a bit too long, though, and might become irritating once you are past their initial "wow" phase. Another cool bit involves the folder icons and the folders themselves being semi-transparent and their backgrounds adapt to the prevailing theme color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may have already noticed the semi-transparent dock, folders, keyboard and Control Center in the screenshots. The Notification and Control Center colors are also adaptive, just like the folders, and they'll change depending on the background. So they might be blue-ish on the homescreen, but light gray in the web browser, or dark gray in the settings, or green in the gallery, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is less transparent and has only two themes - very light or very dark gray. Of course, they also change depending on whether your keyboard has popped up on top of a light or a dark background. Beside the new theme and font, the iOS keyboard is unchanged, which is not a bad thing as it's certainly one of the most comfortable around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dictation is also available courtesy of Siri. Just hit the dictation button to the left of the space bar and fire away. Keep in mind that the performance may suffer in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The changes don't end with those transparent and adaptive visuals. Opening an app involves a zoom in animation over the app icon, which is pretty cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is observable throughout iOS 7. Apple designed the new iOS on independent layers - background, homescreen icons, icon badges, and then app pop-ups. The iPhone then uses its accelerometer and gyroscope to move layers independently and create an illusion of depth. The movement is very subtle. In fact, you might not even notice it if you are not looking for it, but it's there and it looks awesome once you start moving your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is not only available on the homescreen. You can see it in folders and in the pop ups that ask you for passwords or display notifications. Those pop ups by the way are also translucent and adapt their background color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you don't like the parallax effect you can turn it off from the Accessibility settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple iOS 7 brings live wallpapers. You can find them in the relevant section of the Wallpaper Settings. Currently there are seven live wallpapers but there is no wallpaper section available in the App Store. It seems we'll have to rely on Apple for adding more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might have noticed in all these screenshots that Apple has ditched the cellular coverage bars and replaced them with five dots. The battery also got a new icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple decided not to follow the competition and put the connectivity toggles in the notification area. They're in a brand new Control Center instead, that's pulled up with a swipe from the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has five non-customizable rows for various shortcuts. The top row has five toggles - Airplane, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, DND mode and Rotation Lock. The second row has the brightness slider. Next come the media player controls including a volume bar. The fourth row has AirDrop and AirPlay shortcuts. Finally, at the bottom of the Control Center there are four shortcuts - one that turns on/off the LED flash to serve as a flashlight and three app shortcuts - Clock, Calculator and Camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume slider is perhaps a bit redundant but nothing in the Control Center is customizable. It's a great, albeit well overdue, addition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center has been redesigned as well. It now has three tabs - Today, All and Missed. The Today tab has the date, a summary of all events for the day, calendar day view, reminders, stocks and tomorrow's summary. As usual, you can choose which apps you want to show up in the pull-down Notifications and in what order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Today tab is customizable, and you can disable its elements one by one - everything but the date displayed at the top can be removed so it doesn't get in the way. You can even disable the Today tab altogether in the Notification Center for the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The All tab is basically the notification center from iOS 6 but sans the weather, stocks and calendar events. The first two are now part of the Today tab, while the weather is gone for good. You can disable the All tab for the lockscreen as well (just turn off Notifications View). If both Notifications (All) and Today tabs are disabled, the entire Notification Center will no longer be available on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Missed tab displays new emails, messages and missed calls you received while your iPhone 5s was locked. Those notifications are still available in the All tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the handling of notifications hasn't changed a bit. You can opt to disable a notification, set it to be a banner, which will shortly pop up over the status bar or an alert showing up at the center of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also options to disable badges on app icons or disable lockscreen notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, you can interact with notifications straight on the lockscreen. If a notification has just arrived, sliding to unlock will open up the relevant app - upon a missed call, you'll go straight to the phone app. You can also swipe a notification to perform a task - swipe to call back or text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The banner notification is very subtle. If you receive a text in the middle of something, it will briefly pop up over the status bar and disappear in a couple of seconds, and not distract from what you're doing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Do Not Disturb is, as expected, still an integral part of iOS 7. It gives users further control of notifications, or rather their suppression. If turned on, it will mute incoming calls or alerts. You can allow calls from your favorite contacts and have the option to set a specific time interval in which you won't get any notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dedicated toggle to activate the DND feature and it can be customized in the Notifications submenu. When Do Not Disturb is on, a crescent icon appears next to the clock in the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to Apple, iOS 7 offers multi-tasking for all apps. Previously true multi-tasking was reserved only for navigation or music streaming apps, the rest had to go in suspend mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, this multi-tasking for all apps will surely drain the battery faster than Apple would have liked, so there is a catch. Yes, all apps will work in the background, but iOS will learn which one of them you use most often and when.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's say you open the Facebook app every morning and don't use it for the rest of the day. iOS will soon learn that and will optimize the app to work according to your schedule until you change it. This means most of the day and night the app will still be in suspend mode (push notifications will work of course), but iOS will run Facebook shortly before your alarm goes on and load all the content. That way when you open it, your news feed will be already updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed that apps also update in the background when push notifications come in. This is a part of what Apple calls opportunistic updates - the iPhone waits until a data connection is available and starts the updates then, so it doesn't need to activate the connection on another occasion and waste your battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We haven't spent enough time with iOS to give a proper judgment on how well the new multitasking works, but once we do we'll duly update this section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All apps that use Cellular/Wi-Fi connection and can work in the background are listed under Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Background App refresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task-switcher interface is invoked with a double tap on the Home key. It looks a lot like the webOS cards of old and, more recently, the HTC Sense Task switcher - all apps are presented with cards that you can swipe up to close. Each card has the respective app icon so you can easily recognize what's what.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multitasking UI works in both portrait and landscape mode, but you cannot see more than three cards at a time. It's one of the limitations of the card interface and we suspect this is why HTC went for a different task switcher with the One, but here's hoping that Apple will at least fix the landscape mode down the line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 Settings menu has the same layout as in previous versions but updated with the new flat and borderless look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the Background App Refresh, iOS 7 offers even better control over the apps that use mobile data. The Cellular tab offers detailed cellular data breakdown by apps and services, allowing you to properly manage your resources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing worth mentioning is the Vimeo and Flickr integration in addition to Twitter and Facebook. Once you enter your account details in the settings you can upload your photos straight to your Flickr gallery, while your videos will go to your Vimeo. You just need to hit the share key on a picture or a video and use the dedicated Flickr/Vimeo icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last major change about the user interface is the Back gesture available in all iOS 7 default apps (maybe developers will be able to extend the support to third-party apps after launch). Whether you are in settings, App Store, Messages, Notes, Reminders, Safari, etc. a swipe from the left side of the screen will take you one step back.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchID adds another level of security<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Arguably the coolest novelty feature of the Apple iPhone 5s is TouchID. It's a fingerprint scanner that's placed right below a piece of sapphire glass covering the Home button. When you touch your finger against the Home button the sensor will take multiple 500ppi images of your fingerprint, to be processed by the A7 chip and get your iPhone 5s unlocked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Long story short, it is impressively quick and perfectly accurate. The TouchID sensor offers 360-degree readability translating into effortless scanning of your fingerprint. Apple has integrated TouchID as an added security measure, but it'll still allow you to use your passcode as a backup form of validation. Enabling passcode is also a mandatory requirement in order to use TouchID.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting it up is as easy as using it on a daily basis. To get started you have to hold your finger on the Home button until you feel a short vibration. Then, continue to touch and lift your finger whilst making small adjustments to the position of your finger each time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second step is to hold your iPhone 5s as you normally would and touch the Home button again so that the outer edges of your fingerprint get scanned as well. This will make sure your entie fingerprint gets mapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple says that the more you use TouchID the better it'll get. You can commit up to five fingerprint samples (yours or those of family and friends), which is cool for setting a limited list of people with access to your device. Apple warns that with all five fingerprint slots filled in, the TouchID sensor operation may take a slight performance hit, but we didn't notice any such delays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TouchID can be used for more than just unlocking your phone. Apple has integrated the feature into the digital goods purchasing experience. You can use TouchID for making authorizations in the App Store, iTunes Store as well as iBooks Store. You can decide which one of them has access to the TouchID sensor in the Fingerprints settings menu. However, if you've set the Require Password option to Immediately, then TouchID will be disabled for purchases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What bothers us quite a bit is that despite the flawless hardware implementation (the best we have seen so far), Apple hasn't paid enough attention to the software backend of the TouchID feature. It would have made the perfect tool for enabling seamless multi-user access with different security levels or, if that's too much to ask, at least introduce different user preferences for the different fingerprints you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you could assign different permissions to individual users, you could for example share you iPhone 5s with your kids safe in the knowledge that they can unlock it, but not max out your credit on apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature that allows multiple user profiles depending on the fingerprint that unlocked the phone also springs to mind and whatnot. Third-party developers are also locked out of TouchID for now so authorization of any purchases outside the Apple stores are a no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's hoping that Apple's R&amp;D team gets down to work and unlock the great potential that TouchID undoubtedly carries as quickly as possible. Waiting another year for iOS 8 is simply not going to cut it and it might be way too late at that point anyway.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Apple has designed an entirely new chipset to drive the iPhone 5s. It's called the A7 and is the company's first 64-bit mobile system-on-a-chip. According to the gurus at Cupertino, it's twice as fast as the A6 that it replaces in terms of both CPU and GPU power. We'll find out if that's true in just a second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before that, we should mention that the Apple A7 28-nm chip is comprised of a 1.3GHz dual-core CPU dubbed Cyclone which uses ARM's ARMv8 microarchitecture. The GPU, while not officially confirmed, is believed to be the PowerVR G6430. The use of a 64-bit instruction set for the CPU enables Apple to put more than 4GB of RAM on its future generation of products, but the iPhone 5s packs just 1GB. Not that this feels insufficient - the way iOS handles multi-tasking you are extremely unlikely to run out of operating memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to actual benchmarks we start with the new Geekbech 3 test to see how the CPU and memory are doing. The iPhone 5s blasted through the test managing the promised double score over the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c with A6 chips inside them. As you can see Apple A7 is a good match for the quad-core Snapdragon 800 chipsets, too, placing itself right behind the Sony Xperia Z1.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We also ran the iOS version of Linpack. Once again, the iPhone 5s delivers on the promise of twice the performance of the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's time for the multi-platform GFX Benchmark that gives the GPU a run for its money. The iPhone 5s scores a few frames per second less than the Adreno 330 GPU found in the Snapdragon 800 chipset of the Xperia Z1, which is still a great result. In the T-Rex portion of the test the iPhone 5s managed to get even with the current batch of Android flagships.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we put the iPhone 5s through the SunSpider and BrowerMark benchmarks to test Safari's JavaScript and overall browsing performance. The iPhone 5s with its new iOS 7 operating system claimed the top spots and sits comfortably above the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c in both charts. Clearly, Apple has put special attention into the web browsing performance and with the single-core nature of those test not making the A6 and A7 pay for their shortage of cores, its smartphones really shined.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has been updated with the new iOS borderless look and simple color scheme. The logic behind the phonebook app is completely the same though, there is just one new feature - Blacklist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either add contacts to the blacklist from the Settings menu, or you can simply go to a contact and hit Block this Caller key at the bottom. Once blocked you will no longer receive calls, FaceTime and messages (SMS, MMS, iMessages, emails) from this contact. You can of course unblock them at any time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the phonebook offers Facebook and Twitter integration. After you set up your accounts the phonebook will automatically ask you to link your existing contacts with their social ones (if available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can search via the dedicated Search field at the top of the list of contacts or you can use the alphabetical scroll at the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is intuitive and gives you the option to include lots of additional fields, like several addresses, related people, web, email, birthdays, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set different ringtones, message tones and vibration to your favorite contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since iOS 6 your iMessage and FaceTime ID is joined and the phonebook will automatically detect if either service is available with each contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s has very good reception and doesn't suffer from any issues with the embedded antennas. The in-call quality is great as well - this is where the multi-mic setup works quite splendidly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The incoming call and in-call screens have gone flat too. The dialpad itself looks different, though it brings no new usability features. Smart dial is sadly, still missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can reject calls via SMS since the last iOS update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the iPhone 5s to remind you to call back a person at a location or when you're leaving the current one, which is a nifty trick. Keep in mind that doing so will invoke constant use of GPS, which could in turn lead to a significantly reduced battery life but the phone would probably still last a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FaceTime comes as a system app in iOS 7 and looks just like the Phone app. It works both over a cellular data or Wi-Fi. The service now offers voice calls too, in addition to video conference. With FaceTime audio calls and iMessages, iOS users won't need Viber as much to connect with other iOS users free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we've tested the loudspeaker performance of the new iPhone 5s. It marks a slight improvement over the speaker of its predecessor and scored an Average mark. This means you should be able to hear the phone in semi-noisy environments, but to ensure not to miss any calls, we advise you to turn vibration on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New looks for the messaging department<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messages app also gets the new iOS skin. It adds a new option in the conversation view - Contact. If you tap on this key, you'll get options to Call and FaceTime that user, or go to their phonebook profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iMessage service lets you exchange instant messages between iOS 5 or later running iGadgets over Wi-Fi or 3G. You can send plain text as well as multimedia (pictures, sounds, videos) messages. The iMessage conversations are color-coded to differ from the standard SMS/MMS - their bubbles are blue instead of green. A cool thing about them is that each conversation is synced with the iCloud so you'll have it right there and available on all your iDevices, including your Mac (although synchroniszation is not flawless and the time stamps would get messed up at times).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty simple - you type, you add content (optional) and hit send. Adding multimedia is done either by hitting the small picture icon next to the text field or through the sharing menu in the gallery or supported apps (Voice Memos, Notes, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Mail client has the new looks but the functionality is unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VIP lists are available - emails from people on the list will be delivered to a dedicated VIP mailbox and will appear highlighted in the regular inbox. You can also set a different notification regime for VIP emails - so they appear on the lockscreen, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also flag important emails. After you flag your first message, a new Flagged mailbox will appear gathering all of your flagged emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching pictures and videos while composing an email is possible since the iOS 6 - just tap and hold on an empty space and use the popup menu. Bold, Italic and Underline font styles are available in the text editing options, as well as quote font size levels. Text selection works the usual way (tap&amp;hold and select) and the available options will appear as soon you've made the selection: Cut/Copy/Replace/Bold Italic Underline/Quote Level. Quote Level will increase / decrease the quote symbols before the text you're quoting. Finally there is a built-in dictionary. It's very rich in content and conveniently works offline.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Completely redesigned Photos app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos app has been redesigned more thoroughly. To begin with, the Photos tab looks better organized. Prior to iOS 7 we used to get a grid of all of photos there, sorted by date. Images are now organized by date and location, for those that have been geo-tagged. This view is called Moments, with a description always at the top, with time, place and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moments view offers multiple photos selection - you can select an entire folder with just a single tap. Mass Delete, Share (including AirDrop) and Add To Album options are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go a step back, to Collections view where you can better view your sorted photos into groups with labels and much smaller thumbs. Those thumbs are still clickable, you can even scroll them to find the one you're looking for (small thumbs are hard to navigate through though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a city label in Moments or Collections will take you to the old Places view, where you get a map with pins showing where exactly your photos were taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Year view. It squeezes your collection into tight grids for each year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is Shared photos - it has all your Photo streams. Photo Stream, which acts like a social sub-network, works really well and is very simple to set up. You choose what pictures to share and which people to share with. Your buddies on the receiving end will be able to like them and post comments. You can invite users you want to share your Photo Streams with via email or get invited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the third tab is albums. You get three default album types - camera roll, my photo stream and panoramas. Albums can be added, edited and deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are displayed in full size and you can delete, share or edit them. From the sharing menu you also get advanced options such as copy, assign to contact, slideshow, print, use as wallpaper and AirPlay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can AirDrop multiple pictures from this interface as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photo editor is the same as before with a new option to add filters. It supports rotation, cropping, filters and red-eye removal. There's also an Enhance option too. In Edit mode five keys appear at the bottom for the available editing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every new iPhone 5s offers you iPhoto and iMovie powerful Apple apps for free. The iPhoto allows you also to organize your photos by albums and events and you can even create journals - collages of photos you can share via iCould and make it visible to anyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhoto app has richer editing options than the standard gallery, but its UI needs to be updated to match the iOS 7 looks. Not it just looks ... retro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the powerful iMovie editor is available for free as well, you just need to download it once you sign in on the AppStore. You can make your own movies and trailers by adding, cutting, merging, etc. videos, songs and pictures. The app is nicely functional and performs excellently on the A7 chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Limited video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many things have changed in iOS 7 but the video player is definitely not one of them. You can upload only supported formats via iTunes or purchase videos from the iTunes store. This is an extremely disappointing showing by a platform that is supposed to excel at multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of extra functionality is bad enough, but having to use just an extremely limited number of media format or resorting to converting files, which is both slow and inconvenient is a real deal-breaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music and iTunes Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 music player is exactly the same as the one in iOS 6, its appearance is in line with the new iOS design. You can create playlists, delete songs right from within the player and reorder tabs whichever way you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cover Flow is gone for good replaced by the new Album view - you access it by flipping the device landscape. It lists all the covers to the albums you have in your library. Tapping on an album thumb lists all the tracks in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen hasn't changed in functionality neither is the settings. Even in its seventh major iteration iOS still fails to offer configurable equalizers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are logged in with a US Apple ID (the service will roll out in more countries soon), your iOS 7 music player will get an additional iTunes Radio tab. It's a music streaming service with the entire iTunes content available for streaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stations are divided by genres, but once you add a station, you can choose to remove artists or add more songs from an artist/group. You can preview a station before adding it to your list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you like a particular song, you can buy it with just one tap. History is available and you can always return to buy songs later. A Wish List is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Radio is ad-free if you are using iTunes Match. Otherwise, every 7 to 10 songs are broken by about 15sec of commercials.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flagship-worthy audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple smartphones have never disappointed when it comes to audio quality and the iPhone 5s makes no exception. In the active external amplifier part of the test, the iPhone 5s did perfectly and even outdid the iPhone 5c with lower stereo crosstalk. Its volume levels were just as high as on the 5c, which makes them one of the best in business, second only to the HTC One and Butterfly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second trial produced equally impressive scores. The iPhone 5s again managed to beat its lower-tier brother by the virtue of its better stereo and was overall as close to perfect as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the numbers and see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Improved camera hardware and software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5s kept the camera resolution at 8MP for a third generation in a row but make no mistake, it's not the same camera. The sensor has been changed with a 15% bigger unit, which should improve low-light performance. The lens has a wider aperture too - it has gone from F/2.4 to F/2.2, which should allow 25% more light in, another thing to help low-light performance. And daylight performance of the iPhone 5 was already pretty great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s brings another change - True Tone flash. It's consists of two LEDs with slightly different colors. This should allow the camera to get a more accurate reading of the colors in the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 brings a brand new camera interface with some cosmetic changes (it's flat) and it's more usable. You still get two columns of controls - effects, shutter key, gallery shortcut/last image preview on the right and front/back camera toggle, HDR mode and flash mode on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This gives you access to the basic options, but the mode switching has been moved to a swipe gesture. Starting at the default photo mode, square photo and panorama are in one direction video and slo-mo video in the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Square photographs have, of course, been popularized by Instagram and so have photo effects. The iPhone 5s can display a grid of 3 x 3 effects in real time to help you pick the one that's appropriate for the scene. The available effects are Mono, Tonal, Noir, Fade, Chrome, Process, Transfer and Instant. These work with the front-facing camera for selfies too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera supports AF/AE lock as usual with tap and hold on the viewfinder - this can be of great help with tricky scenes. There's a geo-tagging option but no resolution settings as usual. Still, we like the balance the iOS 7 camera finds - almost everything is one tap/swipe away and you get all the options you need for daily smartphone photography. The manual settings of the likes of the Nokia Lumia 1020 are alluring for some creative shots, but most users shoot at full auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time to go over the image quality, we'll also bring in some iPhone 5 photos to see if there's actual progress. iPhone photos have been some of the best in the business for a few years now and the iPhone 5s is no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image processing is nicely mature, bringing noise levels down without sacrificing much high-frequency detail. And there is plenty of detail, great for an 8MP shooter. The 5MP difference between it and 13MP Androids isn't very pronounced. And that's without signs of too much sharpening, something quite a few Androids are guilty of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color rendering settings have been changed - the white balance is now noticeably warmer. The iPhone 5s also exposes shots slightly higher, retaining detail in the highlights at the expense of shadows, which contributes to the different look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried out the new HDR panorama mode, which turns in spotless stitching when there are no moving objects. It also handles bright highlights and dark shadows in the same shot quite well, the only downside is that some areas can look a little washed out. Also, it only does around 180° rather than a full circle. The resolution is impressive high though and there's lots of detail all around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iPhone 5s and iPhone 5 mini-shootout<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We won't do a detailed shootout, but we'll point out the differences that caught our eye. The iPhone 5S shots are sharper, though the difference is minor. Pixel peepers will spot it, while those that only upload downsampled shots to social networks might never know about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s tends to expose shots slightly higher, but it doesn't use longer shutter speeds or higher ISO settings compared to the iPhone 5 - instead it leverages on the wider aperture that lets more light in. The iPhone 5s also has slightly wider dynamic range than its predecessor thanks to its larger sensor, although the difference is, once again, pretty minor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing we'd criticize the iPhone 5s here is that the warmer white balance gives photos a noticeable yellow tint but the good thing is saturation has been toned down to more realistic levels. The iPhone 5, which was running iOS 7 too, has a more neutral white balance, though it has its own issues (the grey asphalt looks reddish).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new lens on the iPhone 5s is slightly wider than the iPhone 5. The tiny difference is illustrated below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took both iPhones to a dark room to snap a photo - our intention was to check if the new flash really does allow for more accurate colors, but the result was quite surprising. Both phones did a 1/16s exposure but the iPhone 5s shot at ISO 100, while the old model did ISO 200. And the difference is noticeable, whether it's having a second LED flash, a wider aperture and a bigger sensor or a combination of those things, the iPhone 5s shows a much improved low-light shooting capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos have a yellow tint though, which may not surprising given the daylight shots, but those promises for improved color accuracy didn't pan out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can check out how the iPhone 5s does on our three standard charts against its predecessor and all the other phones in our database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   iPhone 5s vs. iPhone 5 in our photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s camera records 1080p video at 30fps, which is the most popular option at the moment but we're already seeing UHD videos and 1080p @ 60fps. The iPhone 5s does have a high framerate mode, 720p @ 120fps, which is used for slow motion videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard 1080p @ 30fps videos are captured at 17Mbps bitrate, which is about the average for Androids too. Most disappointingly, the iPhone 5s continues to capture mono sound (64Kbps, 44.1kHz) just like its predecessor, which bewilders us now as it did then - both phones have multiple mics, so it's really disappointing that Apple didn't put them to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can snap a photo during video recording, but that comes out with 1080p resolution and are barely any better than grabbing a frame from the video. The only difference is that those shots have the same FoV as the still camera, while the video itself has much narrower viewing angle due to the way the iPhone 5s stabilization works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is excellent - videos are smooth, have no noticeable noise and plenty of detail. The videos carry over the warmer white balance and slightly oversaturated colors of the still photos, but there's no pixilation, oversharpening or jumpy continuous autofocus, which are our most common complaints for other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched sample here - 1080p @ 30fps (6 seconds, 13.4MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Slo-mo videos are shot at 720p resolution and 120fps frame rate, which can give you a 4x slowdown. The bitrate jumps to a hefty 30Mbps, which suggests Apple picked 17Mbps for regular videos with storage in mind (and those certainly don't suffer from low bitrate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, one thing we noticed is that the phone does a cool-looking ramp up effect where time runs normally and then smoothly transitions to 4x slowdown. The videos themselves are at 4x slowdown the whole time so you lose the great effect if you download the video to a computer or share it on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We re-encoded one video to 30fps to show you what the slo-mo looks like, but bear in mind that due to the extra re-encoding step the quality has been degraded a bit. You can download the original video here - 720p @ 120fps (8MB). You'll need a player capable of reducing the framerate to experience the slowdown, the video itself runs in realtime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tested the video stabilization of the iPhone - it's a software stabilization, there are no special hardware components. We pitted it against the HTC One which has actual optical image stabilization, but the iPhone 5s video actually looks smoother. The trade-off, as we said, is the narrower field of view on the Apple smartphone, but the result is still mightily impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The field of view of the iPhone 5s video camera is a little wider than the one on the iPhone 5, letting you capture a bit more in the frame. The difference is slightly more pronounced than what the still camera showed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the wider FoV, the new iPhone 5s actually manages to capture more detail - it's not like your iPhone 5 is suddenly junk, but there is definitely a difference if you look at the two videos up close (it's easiest to see in foliage). The videos have a warner white balance once again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our video compare tool is another great place to check for differences in video quality between the iPhone 5s and last year's model. There are plenty of droids to throw it against too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Powerful connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5s supports quad-band GSM, penta-band 3G plus a plethora of LTE bands. On its A1453 model the number of supported LTE bands is a whopping 13. A CDMA version is available as well. If you want to know more about the different model versions and the carriers they support check out the table below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s supports dual-band (2.4 GHz as well as 5 GHz) Wi-Fi a/b/g/n. Some of its Android rivals come with the latest ac Wi-Fi standard, which offers faster speed transfers, but unfortunately, the iPhone 5s doesn't yet support it. Tethering, however, is supported, although it's up to your carrier if you'll be able to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP support, but that's hardly any good for data transfers. We've long since given up hope that Apple will enable sending and receiving files on iOS devices through Bluetooth, but as cloud storage solutions improve we no miss it that much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s offers A-GPS and GLONASS support, just like its predecessor. Also just like its predecessor, the smartphone is impressively quick in getting a satellite lock, taking just a few seconds on most occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one new feature in the iOS 7 connectivity department - AirDrop. It's a system-wide file sharing service between supported iDevices. AirDrop needs to have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop is available in every share menu throughout the iOS 7. You can send pictures, videos, App Store and iTunes links, Notes, Maps links, all kind of files from file managing apps (i.e. Filer, Flash Drive, Air Disk, etc.), Office docs, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there are people with AirDrop service around you, they will automatically appear in the dedicated AirDrop field. You just mark your files, select people and hit the send key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop won't work with other phones and PCs, but will work on Macs running on OS X Mavericks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regular USB mass storage isn't available but there's a workaround using the iTunes computer software. You can transfer whatever files you want, but those are only made available to the app that you've dropped them onto. Good things is you are not restricted to files compatible with said app and you can simply drag&amp;drop files that you would download on another computer later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, hardware storage expansion is still out of Apple's policy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple is continually improving its Find My iPhone service. The latest iOS 7 updates it with the so-called Activation Lock. This will not only protect your personal data but also make your iDevice inoperable once wiped unless you enter your Apple ID. This means the stolen or lost iGadgets will be of no use to thieves or finders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud was an integral part of iOS 5 and is present here in iOS 7. It syncs all of your important data between all of your devices running iOS 5 or above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get 5 GB of free storage but you can buy more if you want. Selecting which apps to sync is pretty easy. iCloud even remembers each device you've backed up so you can restore them separately if you wish. You can naturally delete older backups to free up space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has records on exactly what apps you've purchased, what you have installed on an iDevice and what you've deleted for some reason. Apple keeps tabs on this for each of your iDevices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you chose to sync with iCloud, Apple will sync only the app's personal data, not the entire IPA file (as iTunes did). Here is an example:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Say, you have Angry Birds installed on your iPhone. It has a save data of 1.5MB. Apple will sync only this file. If you delete the game and later install it again (free, from the Purchased list), your iPhone will download the original IPA from the App Store and will get back this 1.5MB file too - a lot more natural process to sync an app rather than keeping the whole image. If you use an app as USB storage (Filer or even CineXPlayer), then, by default, the whole content will be backed up too, eating your backup quote quite fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing with the iCloud app sync - when you buy a new app, it will be pushed to all of your iDevices automatically (if available and if you have enabled this feature from the AppStore settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has announced a new connectivity mode that will be supported in a wide range of vehicles, starting in 2014 - iOS in the car. You will be able to see your iPhone screen on your compatible car display. And you will be able to control it via your car controls or just tell Siri via your car audio system what it is you want it to do for you on your iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will be able to use navigation, dictate messages, make calls, play music or iTunes radio, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the confirmed car manufacturers to integrate the new service are Honda, Mercedes, Nissan, Ferrari, Chevrolet, Infiniti, Kia, Hyundai, Volvo, Opel, Jaguar and Acura.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>New Safari with unified search field<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has finally updated the Safari browser. Yes, it got flat looks and 3D tab switching, but that's just the beginning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing you'll notice is the unified search/address field. It was about time, really. The next long-awaited features are the full-screen view and auto-hide. Open in background handy options premieres as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari finally supports more than 8 simultaneously opened web tabs. We quit trying to reach the new limit (if there is one) at around 22. The tab switching interface is a 3D arc where you swipe a tab left or right to close it. You can rearrange the tabs, you can add new ones or switch to private browsing. It's certainly looks good but it's a departure from the flat design language seen elsewhere on iOS7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you switch to private browsing, you'll need to either close all current tabs or migrate them to Private as well. It's not possible to have private and non-private tabs open simultaneously like in Google Chrome. When you are browsing in Private mode, Safari switches to a dark gray color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you open your History you'll find a new tab called Shared Links. Here you'll find all links from your Twitter timeline, with authors and comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari in iOS 7 supports the iCloud keychain where you can store all of your passwords and credit card info (sans the security code). There is also a password generator available, in case you are out of ideas. What's good about this setup is that all your save content from the computer version of Safari is now available straight on your phone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In much the same way, iCloud syncs your opened tabs, along with offline reading. Safari also allows you access to your multimedia content without exiting the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like before, if a page is compatible with the integrated Reader (most of the article pages out there are) you get a Reader button right into the address bar as soon as the page loads. The Reader strips the webpage of ads and makes the layout and font size more suited to a smaller phone screen. And best of all, if you are reading a multi-page article (such as our reviews) getting from one page to the next is automatic as soon as you scroll to the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the font size via two controls at the top, and also there's a built-in dictionary to look up unknown words.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Pages allows you to import, create or edit documents (doc, docx are supported). It isn't as powerful as some of its Android counterparts, but it covers all the basics and will do an excellent job for most users. It needs to be updated with the iOS 7 skin though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numbers supports Excel files and also covers all major functionalities you'll probably need. You can easily import files via iTunes too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Keynote opens and edits (PowerPoint) presentations. It has all the tools you'll need to create a decent presentation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app has been revamped as well and has a very useful new feature. You can now drag and drop events if you want to move them to different days. Just tap and hold on an event and you can move it to a different day and hour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar benefits greatly from the Facebook integration. Birthdays and events from Facebook are immediately synced with your calendar but you still get the option to omit them from the Calendars tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view by list (iOS's agenda variant), day and month. There's also a toggle to get back to today if you've strayed too far back or forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilting your device to landscape orientation automatically opens up the weekly view, which lists all of your events in a side-scrollable fashion. Events are color-coded so you can recognize what's what with a quick glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating an event is done the same way as before. You can choose which calendar you want the event to be synced with, add a location, additional notes and set up an alert.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the Calendars tab. You can customize the iCloud personal and job-related event colors to your liking. You can also create additional calendar entries, for example if you have two jobs (or projects), etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reminders interface has been changed as well. It comes with three default lists - Scheduled, Calendar and Reminders, but you can create your own lists as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up a reminder is easy. The available options are time, place, repeat, priority and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator has a stylish flat new look but no new functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the refreshed Note app. You can share, copy and print notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app has got the new skin as well. It has world clock, alarms, stopwatch and timer. You can set any of the songs in your music library as an alarm sound. You can also choose from your custom ringtones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather app has had a major update. It now offers live weather animations, a lot more weather information plus the time of sunrise and sunset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom out and get to the cities view, which would show the weather in all the locations you have stored at the same time. Live animations are also available in the city preview. Night-time specific animations are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compass app, besides the new interface, got some new functionality too. If you swipe to left you'll get an inclinometer. Unfortunately, the inclinometer only measure one of the angles of inclination, rather than both, so it's probably too early to retire your dedicated app. The Stocks app has new color scheme and UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Memos are available as well. You can capture practically unlimited voice memos and send them to others via a message or mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iBooks offers various font and color settings, but on a screen this size, it's just not the best e-reading experience. Pages are side-scrollable only and on a mobile phone that doesn't quite make sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iBooks app is also a PDF viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose different fonts, reduce and increase the text size, change the background and play around with brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PassBook is an e-ticket app that handles all kinds of electronic tickets and reservations (including boarding passes), loyalty cards, coupons, etc. It's Apple's answer to apps like Google Wallet but without the additional NFC support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The location-aware app makes the right coupon available in the right place and at the right time. The PassBook will report the balance on coupons and cards, let you check your ticket seats and can even show you relevant notifications (e.g. gate or terminal change for a flight).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Siri accepts more commands, has new voices<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A new iOS version just can't afford to pay no attention to Siri. After more than two years in development the assistant has finally graduated from beta.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as the rest of the iOS 7, Siri now looks different. It always launches in full-screen and has a real-time voice graph. Another UI novelty is the option to edit your voice request with the keyboard in case Siri didn't hear you right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri supports and uderstands English (American, Canadian, Australian, British), French (France, Canada, Switzerland), German (Germany, Switzerland), Japanese, Italian (Italy, Switzerland), Spanish (Mexico, Spain, US), Mandarin (China, Taiwan), Korean, and Cantonese (Hong Kong) languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most important Siri upgrades, of course, are under the hood. Siri now has Wikipedia integration and it offers new voices, there is both female and male English US for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri can also carry out commands affecting the iOS - it can turn Bluetooth or Wi-Fi on/off, increase brightness, play voicemails, check other people's social network status, play iTunes Radio stations, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri is a really powerful voice assistant capable of POI search. Assistance with restaurant booking is part of Siri's set of skills. It will find you exactly the restaurant you are looking for and filter the results based on user reviews. You can run impressively detailed searches based on food type, location, outdoor, pool, price range, ratings, etc. This feature is not available in every country, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri also answer slots of questions and isn't limited to game scores. History, stats, player bios, player comparison, teams, records, etc. Siri should be able to return most of the info right onto its own screen, without switching over to the browser. The same applies to movies. You will get all of your movie-related answers right inside the Siri window - anything about actors, directors, awards, movie stats, premieres and tickets, reviews, trailers, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has replaced Google with TomTom as map provider for the iOS native Maps application. It also offers voice-guided navigation courtesy of Siri. The navigation will work even on the lockscreen or in the background. Real-time traffic reports are available and Apple is also crowdsourcing the live traffic info anonymously from iOS users on the road. Sadly, there isn't an option to pre-cache maps for offline use, which can be a problem if you need guidance abroad or when you don't have signal. Still, if you set up a route when you have internet access, Maps will cache the maps needed to guide you along the way so you can finish your trip even without an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of iOS 7, the navigation service also includes turn-by-turn walking directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D Flyover mode is a great bonus for your viewing pleasure. When you enable the 3D view (outside navigation) you will be able to explore cityscapes from birds-eye view. The currently available selection is quite limited, but more and more areas are joining Flyover in time. You can zoom, tilt and rotate using two-finger gestures to explore 3D landmarks rendered in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When Maps launched with iOS 6 it was quite a disappointment because of its poor map data, but Apple managed to deal with most of the problems and lack of data and accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you prefer the good ol' Google Maps, it is available for free in the App Store and is on par with its Android version. You get voice navigation where available, offline map caching, Street View, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>App Store now has automatic updates, nearby apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS App Store is still the richest application store to date. It uses a tabbed interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Featured pages with scrollable rows is available as well as the usual Charts (Top Paid, Free and Grossing apps), Search and Updates. There is on new tab that replaces Genius - Near Me, which we'll cover below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 brings one more feature that users have been asking for - automatic app updates. Once you turn it on in the App Store settings, your apps will update automatically (via Wi-Fi only) and you'll get notifications for the completed updates in the notification center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you decide to use the automatic app updates, the Updates tab in the AppStore will display a list of all recent updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Store offers another new feature - Nearby apps. Here you'll find the most popular apps people have downloaded in your current location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Store has a new hidden extra that will be appreciated by those using iTunes gift cards. You can now scan the card codes with you camera right in the App Store interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual you can view all the apps you've bought on your current iDevice or previous ones through the Purchased menu in the Update tab. iCloud plays a key part here - all of your purchased apps from each device show up and are ready for download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iTunes store is where you get music, videos, TV shows, movies, podcasts and ringtones. It has a similar tabbed interface like the AppStore divided into Music, Movies, Search, Tones and More.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music syncing is probably the trickiest part of the iCloud sync. Along with the tracks purchased from the iTunes store you surely have a collection of your own that you sync with your iOS device via iTunes. Apple is also offering a service to sync both collections in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music you've purchased at the iTunes Store will be easy to sync automatically across all your iGadgets. But you will need to use the iTunes Match service for the rest of your music collection if you want it synced too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Match will scan your collection on the computer and check for matches with songs in the Apple's iTunes Store. If there is a match, the iTunes song will be synced, if not - well, Apple will upload this song on their servers and then sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So iTunes scans yours songs and pushes them to all your other devices if they match. If some of your tracks are of lower bitrate than 256Kbps, the iTunes Store will replace them with higher quality (256Kbps). The iTunes Match service costs $25(US) or ?25(EU) a year.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Game Center gets a new look<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Honestly, the Game Center has always looked awful, but in iOS 7 Apple finally did something about it. We are rather fond of the new look of the app, which is in line with the rest of the operating system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as functionality is concerned the Game Center has remained pretty much unchanged - it has your games, your friends and your challenges.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For half a decade Apple made just one iPhone a year and each was at least in the running for the best phone of the season. This year is different but at one point it seemed so for the wrong reasons. For a moment there, we thought Apple may have ended up with no potential winner out of two runners in the race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never mind the 5c, it's an old phone in new clothes, but yes, we were that skeptical about the 5s at first. It has got to be the smallest update a new iPhone has brought since the whole thing started. Having lived with it for a while now, we see that the upgrades are small but well thought out and executed, for a greater improvement in user experience than the mere sum of the updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The A7 chipset is not meant to set a speed record, it's meant to run iOS 7 smoother than A6 ran iOS 6 and it delivers. Plus, the future-proofing of course. The camera doesn't go head first into the megapixel race, but meaningful upgrades to both the hardware and software make it one of the better cameras around. Even the fingerprint sensor is meant to be a quicker alternative to the four-digit PIN, rather than an NSA-grade security feature. Perhaps, different levels of access would've been a great addition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the iPhone 5s is what we want most phones to be - compact, premium-quality, some improved features, some to make life easier and an OS that works equally well for children, teenagers and adults.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our biggest quarrel with Apple is the screen - a big screen (4.3-4.7", perhaps) is a must for a high-end smartphone with aspirations for multimedia consumption, gaming and productivity. The resolution could use an update too - the PPI was stunning in 2010 when the iPhone 4 was announced, not so much today. We guess we have to wait until iPhone 6 to, hopefully, get that wish granted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What if the iPhone 5s is too pricy for you? The iPhone 5c is no alternative, you'd be better off getting a second-hand iPhone 5 (it's the 5c in the body of a 5s). And if you already have an iPhone 5, the upgrade isn't worth the $200 in the US (let alone other markets where the price is much higher). iPhone users with 4S and earlier are the only ones that could seriously think about upgrading, as the cumulative changes would be worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Apple iPhone 5c ? Apple iPhone 5 ? Apple iPhone 4S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, Android has an answer to the metallic build of the iPhone 5s and it's the HTC One - with a bigger, sharper screen, optical image stabilization (OIS), more base storage, better audio, cheaper... no really, the iPhone 5s in Europe is ?700 and the One is ?500 (and that's for 16GB and 32GB respectively - equaling storage means the premium rises to ?300).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mini version, the HTC One mini, is a great alternative too. It's not much bigger than a 5s with its 4.3" screen and while not as powerful, with limited storage and no OIS, it's a great midrange option that comes at almost half the price of an iPhone 5s. If you think about it, you can get the One mini now and upgrade to its successor next year and you would have spent as much as the iPhone 5s costs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC One ? HTC One mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X is the iPhone of the Android world in a way - it emphasizes user experience over raw specs (unlike the Samsungs, HTCs, LGs and Sonys) and it has its own unique personality thanks to its highly customizable build (you can even have a back panel made of real wood) and the always-on voice commands. With very slim bezels, it's not that much bigger than the iPhone despite its 4.7" screen, but it costs almost as much too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is perhaps the most technologically advanced Android phone at the moment with a 5.2" screen that fits in the body the size of the HTC One, a 13MP OIS camera with 1080p video recording @ 60fps, robust 3,000mAh battery and much more. It's plastic-made and the software might be too highly customized for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 has a 20.7MP camera with a large sensor (but no OIS), and a gorgeous 8.5mm glass and aluminum body that houses a 3,000mAh battery and can dive under water. The bezels are a bit over the top just as on the iPhone 5s, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG G2 ? Sony Xperia Z1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the iPhone 5s is the popular kid at school, the Samsung Galaxy S4 is the one whose parents buy it every toy in the store. It's no match for the Apple build quality, but the Galaxy S4 has a bigger screen, easy reparability, expandable storage and more features than you'll discover in a year of usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This one has a mini too, the Galaxy S4 mini. Its screen isn't as sharp as the iPhone's or One mini's and it's all plastic, but it has a beefier chipset and slightly better camera compared to the One mini and expandable storage. Oh, and a dual-SIM version too, something no iPhone has but some people need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4 ? Samsung I9190 Galaxy S4 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, let's break out of the iOS/Android struggle for power and check the third horse in the race - Windows Phone 8. We mean mainly the Nokia Lumia 1020, with its amazing 41MP OIS camera with lossless zooming. The other WP phones are not nearly as interesting, but they don't have that camera hump either, which is 1020's biggest downside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 1020</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We quite like the Apple iPhone 5s - with layer upon layer of polish, the Cupertino creation is nearing a work of art. We may cringe at the small 4" screen, but it's actually the price tag that would have us walking past the Apple Store window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the most expensive phone we have here, and by a good margin too, especially when you factor in the storage limitations. And that's in the US where pricing is relatively sane and carrier subsidies are the norm, in Europe things border on the ridiculous.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 5s is an amazing phone within its own niche. The funny thing is that niche is only getting bigger - regardless of the fact that Apple keeps on falling behind Android flagships in the specs race and iOS hasn't been able to match the feature set of the Google platform for a while now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As long as the cash keeps pouring in, Apple can go on and play its own game and make its own rules. Second year in a row and it looks like this may go on forever. The iPhone 5s will cruise through its term at the helm. The iPhone 6 is the next one we will be looking at to hopefully stir things up. In a good way or bad? In Apple's own way.</paragraph>
