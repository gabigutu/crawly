			<paragraph>Samsung and Armani do it again and the GSMArena fashion column is back in business. It's a whole new dress code this time, as the Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani leaves the tux in the closet and goes clubbing. And if a name that opens doors is not enough, the Emporio Armani phone by Samsung claims to have an ear for music. We guess there's no doubt though, its No 1 job is to get you noticed. Aptly dubbed Night Effect, the M7500 Emporio Armani just loves it when it's dark. So, someone please hit the lights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each time a fashion brand enters the mobile phone market controversy is inevitable. The haute couture label certainly justifies the asking price but will the handset get away with gaps in the spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani is a stylish handset with a distinct focus on music. The flashing light effects, the dedicated music keys plus the 3.5mm jack and the slightly redone music player application are a reason enough for music lovers to check it out before purchasing their next handset. The distinct music slant is also quite in line with the handset's obvious refusal to compete for a top slot in the fashion phone segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Emporio Armani logo, Samsung are trying to attract users who have both music features and style in mind. The phone is mainly youth-oriented, especially with the flashy stripes and logos on the sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is interesting to note the partnership that gave birth to the Samsung Armani phone back in September 2007 was not a one-hit-wonder. But Samsung have obviously tried to not make it d?j? vu all over again. The original Giorgio Armani touchscreen phone clearly has the high-end sophistication, confidence and class associated with the luxury Giorgio Armani brand whereas the Emporio Armani target range is different and that's obviously reflected in the M7500. Take the flashy branding away and you get a regular handset with music on its mind. Think M3510 and M3200 of the Beat series.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Giorgio Armani phone ? Samsung M3510 ? Samsung M3200</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though it's hard to identify a clear competitor for the Emporio Armani branded M7500 - as such partnerships are not so common in the mobile-phone world - we should definitely mention some phones which have a lot in common with the Samsung M7500. Probably the Walkman phones from Sony Ericsson are the major competitor for the Emporio Armani handset. Walkmans in this price range do seem to have the upper hand in terms of features though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 300 euro they're asking for can get you Sony Ericsson W902, which matches the features of the M7500 but adds a 5MP AF camera, accelerometer for auto screen rotation, image geo-tagging and nice perks like SensMe and Shake control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson W902</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Half the price of the M7500 is another music-centered competitor - Nokia 5320 XpressMusic. This S60-driven phone is 3mm thicker, has only a 2MP camera with fixed focus and a smaller 2" display but outdoes the Emporio Armani with its 8-way Navi key, dual-band HSDPA and smartphone capabilites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5320 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola ROKR E8 can also come into play and again it's almost twice as cheap as the M7500 Emporio Armani. The Moto's limitations are the 2" display, no 3G support and the 2MP fixed focus camera. On the other hand, the E8 is only 10.6mm thin, has a touch-sensitive morphing keypad, scroll wheel and 2 GB of inbuilt memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola ROKR E8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we wrap it up, Samsung do have another co-branded phone: the Samsung F480 Hugo Boss. This one differs from the original F480 only by virtue of the Hugo Boss insignia on the case and of course the well-stocked retail package.</paragraph>

		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The M7500 Emporio Armani measures 114.9 x 47.4 x 12 mm and weighs 90 grams. It's a solid piece - without being bulky. The handset handles well, the neat bar shape and clean lines are much appreciated. We only think a slimmer girth would've been a great boost to the styling. There is no reason for it to be 12mm thick apart from the 3.5mm audio jack and, more importantly, the flashy Emporio Armani logo on the side.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Emporio Armani phone is entirely made of plastic and that's not a complaint. It still looks very appealing and humbly acknowledges that metal belongs in a different league - that of the original Giorgio Armani handset. On the front panel a glossy surface encloses the screen, while the keypad has a brushed metal effect. The phone's sides and back have a soft rubbery finish that's pleasant to touch and provides great grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece of the M7500 Emporio Armani is placed in the middle at the topmost part of the front. Right next to it are the secondary video-call camera and the ambient light sensor. The ambient light sensor controls the keypad backlighting in order to save energy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the front is taken up by the 2.2" display and the keypad. As you might know, those key elements have a special chapter in our reviews, so we won't look at them in detail now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone features only the connectivity port. Instead of their proprietary USB port, Samsung have embedded a standard microUSB connector instead. There's no backwards compatibility with other Samsung phones, but you can use most accessories out there that plug into microUSB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of that left side is taken up by the big Emporio Armani logo with LED stripes on either side that glow and flash in the same color as the logo when activated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video to see what we mean:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung chose to locate the microSD card slot under the battery cover but not under the battery, so it's still hot-swappable. The slot can take microSDHC cards with a capacity of up to 16GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top and bottom we find nothing but the lanyard eyelet and the microphone pinhole respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7500 right side hosts the three dedicated music controls, the volume rocker and the camera key. The music keys have the same backlighting as the stripes and the Armani logo on the other side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is quite thin but nicely projecting and thus very tactile and responsive. It doubles as a zoom lever but zoom is not available when the camera is set to the shoot in its highest resolution. Typical for Samsung, the volume rocker can also be used for scrolling up and down in menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music controls are pretty straightforward, offering the usual Play/Pause, Fast-forward, Rewind and Skip functionality. The Play/Pause button is set to launch the music player right from the standby screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is small but very tactile, and the distinct half press for auto-focus is commendable. Our only issue with the camera key is that it also accommodates the basic Task Manager - the so called application switch, which lets you quickly toggle between calling, texting, browsing and Java Apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether the shutter key will launch the camera or the application switch is a matter of user preference. A dedicated setting lets you choose between either and offers a compromise option, which displays a prompt every time you press the key in standby. Not the most comfortable solution, but you still get both a dedicated camera key and a Task Manager at the expense of an extra click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of that very same right side is the standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the M7500 Emporio Armani could've been great with its soft rubbery finish and neat and simple styling, was it not for the huge Emporio Armani logo. Maybe it's just us but we don't really see the need for such excess. The backlit logo on the side is noticeable enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dead center at the top is the nicely recessed, but otherwise unprotected, 3 MP camera lens. The loudspeaker grill is cleverly integrated into the Emporio Armani logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover - simple slide down and lift - reveals the SIM card compartment and the 960 mAh Li-Ion battery. Talk time is quoted at 4 hours and 20 minutes with 290 hours of stand-by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In real life we are quite impressed with the battery life of the Samsung Emporio Armani. In moderate use, it lasted for 6 days on a single charge. So we guess, even if you push it to the limits, you can count on at least three days of power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality and handling of the M7500 Emporio Armani are very good. Quality materials have been used and the phone seems quite fit to resist the everyday wear and tear. It's probably not as exquisite as one would expect in the fashion phone segment but we can't complain about the subdued yet solid styling and sturdiness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Views on the light effects may vary from a major selling point to a big turnoff for those who like to keep a low profile. We think they're absolutely fine - they're fully customizable and that includes switching them off completely. The only thing we wish we could customize is the gargantuan Emporio Armani logo at the rear. Yes we know, scratching it off doesn't exactly count as customization.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display: OLED eclipsed by light effects<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The M7500 Emporio Armani QVGA OLED display totals 256K colors on a 2.2" diagonal. The OLED screen is keen to impress in terms of brightness and contrast but we somehow feel the preinstalled Emporio Armani styled themes don't do it justice. As expected, performance under direct sunlight is not the best there is, but OLED displays are hardly known for outstanding sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it's not the M7500 display that will attract attention but rather the glowing light effects you see on the side of the phone and the backlit music keys. They all glow in one of three different colors - red, blue or green. The lights are associated with themes, but are not entirely theme-dependent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Changing the active theme will always affect the external light color but you also have direct access to the light effect settings so you can change light color independently. If you are not in the mood or you do not want to attract attention you can switch off the external glowing stripes and logos. Additionally, you have three levels of brightness of the external light to choose from.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad is very good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of the Emporio Armani phone is made of black, nicely brushed plastic and is entirely flat. The only thing that sticks out is the large round D-pad. Don't get fooled, this is no scroll-wheel. But the round D-pad is a nice touch we think, on an exterior dominated by clean shapes and straight lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The superb tactility is an added gain. That actually applies to all the controls around the D-pad. There are two soft keys and, of course, the call and end keys, but the "C" button, which Samsung normally put in their phones, is not present here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are very comfortable despite being completely flat and you are unlikely to make any typing errors. Key press feedback is great and we think that the flatbed keypad on the Emporio Armani phone is not only a treat to look at but quite user-friendly too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting is very even and strong. Even the D-pad ring is superbly illuminated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already pointed out, the keypad backlighting is controlled by the ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: facelift and usability boost<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The M7500 Emporio Armani has the typical Samsung user interface. There are some minor changes, mainly in the themes, logos and screensavers, but that's all you get to distinguish it as an Armani-branded phone. We expected a much richer user interface to tie in with the branding, but that was it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite unexpectedly, the major novelty affects usability rather than looks. A handy task bar accommodating 5 shortcuts to menu items and applications is available on the homescreen, along the lines of Nokia's active standby. The shortcut bar is customizable save for the last slot, which is always reserved for the external light setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four preinstalled themes in the handset but they offer little variety. All are Emporio Armani branded and all you can change is the color of the interface and the external light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu itself displays as either a V-shape or the more conventional 3x4 grid. The V-shaped main menu is another novelty for Samsung and we see it implemented here for the first time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default menu scheme is black and white icons on a colorful background, which is actually an angled Emporio Armani logo. The transition effects are rich but don't offer any novelty when compared to previous Samsung phones. Every next submenu you select smoothly slides in - or out, when you exit - a transition we've seen and liked in the original Samsung Soul.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'd also be interested to note that the network indicator has the shape of the Emporio Armani logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialing display is also customizable by font type, size, color and background color -just as with every other Samsung phone we've used so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch is the basic task manager - the so called Application switch, which lets you quickly toggle between calling, texting, browsing and Java Apps. The Java apps section allows you to run several Java titles simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The uncomfortable thing about the Application switch is that it can only be started with the camera key. There's a setting that allows you to use the camera key for only the task switcher, the camera or for both. The last options brings up a popup window every time you press the key.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook and calls: nothing unusual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Samsung M7500 stores up to 1000 contacts with multiple fields. When viewing contacts, you can choose between displaying phone memory, SIM memory or both. Other than that, 21 fields of information are available for each contact including eight number fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Signal reception with the Samsung M7500 was excellent. A nifty feature that we've seen in all Samsung phones recently is Smart dialing. When you punch in some digits the handset automatically fetches not only the contacts whose phone numbers correspond, but also contacts whose names match the key input (much like T9 but for dialing). The only limitation is that when you input numbers matching a name but not an actual number, you have to press the OK key to see the search as spelling results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the Samsung Emporio Armani stacks up against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. The M7500 is a good performer - it misses the "Very Good" mark by a slight margin so it's unlikely that you will miss calls, even on noisy streets. You can find more info about our loudspeaker test as well as the results of all other tested devices here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging traditional<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani can handle SMS, MMS, Push messages and email. The phone will store up to 500 text messages, while MMS and email are only limited by the available memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, a T9 dictionary is at hand, and it does its job quickly and intuitively. The messages can be sorted by six criteria: date, sender, type, subject, size, and protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is quite straightforward. It can manage POP or IMAP accounts and even SSL support is there, which means you can use it with mail services that require it, such as Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email retrieval is user-defined: you can choose between headers only and entire messages and the client can be set up to check mail at a chosen interval. Not only files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager and dummy picture gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7500 file browser is pretty much standard for Samsung handsets. There is 120MB of inbuilt memory at your disposal. And of course, you can always top that up thanks to the memory card slot, which supports microSDHC cards with a capacity of up to 16GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The issue that Samsung phones have with full memory cards affects the Emporio Armani phone as well. When you insert a card with thousands of files on it, it takes quite some time (up to several minutes) for the card to become operational. As it turns out, it's not a matter of how full a memory card is, but instead of the number of files stored. No worries at all if you are not in a rush - just insert the card and wait for the memory card icon next to the battery indicator to change from transparent to white - then you are ready to access it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager has preconfigured folders for different types of files - images, video, music and sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. You can copy or move files freely and you can create and delete folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening the Images folder. And again, you can sort files by date, type, name, and size. Unfortunately, zooming only works with pictures in portrait mode and the zoom option is absent in landscape mode. Generally, zooming on a photo taken with the camera is painfully slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Emporio Armani also offers ShoZu integration, meaning you can upload images and videos directly to ShoZu straight from the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated Image Editor is a very capable application, especially for a feature phone. It allows you to apply a whole bunch of effects and tweaks. Transformations and crops, as well as insertion of various items, are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, the Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani offers you almost all of the most popular editing capabilities you could possibly use on a cell phone. However, we still doubt that anyone takes image editing on their mobiles seriously, especially on a 2.2" display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player could've been great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung handsets usually excel in music player capabilities (and audio quality too, we should add). The M7500 Emporio Armani music player offers various track-sorting filters such as artist, album, genre, composer, and recents. There's also a podcast section in the music player menu. You can create your own playlists of course. The music player also makes use of album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have 13 sound effect modes, which are equivalent to the standard equalizers used by other brands. Among the sound effect modes are surround, dynamic, wide, megabass and bass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can be minimized to play in the background, while the current track shows up on the standby screen. You can control the music player directly from the home screen using your D-pad or the dedicated keys at the side. If the player is playing in the background, a press and hold on the Play/Pause key will restore the full application. To exit the music player app you need to hit the End button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M7500 Emporio Armani also has a music recognition feature (like Sony Ericsson's TrackID): Shazam's 'Find Music' service. By recording and sending a tune to the Shazam server, users can easily retrieve a track's name and artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version of the Sony Ericsson TrackID service (found in Sony Ericsson C905 for example) is far more advanced. While Samsung's music recognition displays only the name of the track and the artist, TrackID retrieves the album and provides a link to all tracks on it. Other interesting TrackID features are "Find similar Music", "Send music info via SMS", "TrackID charts" and a very extensive "Artist info" section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess we just can't help a brief sad look at the Beat series. What makes us sad is not the two inexpensive music handsets by Samsung being so miserably - and undeservedly - underrated. The thing is the Emporio Armani phone lacks a couple of nifty little features that could've felt right at home. Turn-to-mute and motion play (the Samsung style shake control) are available in both the M3510 and the M3200 of the Beat series. It's a shame the Emporio Armani phone fails to deliver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7500 comes complete with an FM radio with RDS. The radio can run in the background. Additionally you can set a radio program as a wakeup alarm and also there's an option to set a reminder for a broadcast that you don't want to miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, on our unit (pre-release, but quite close to retail) the FM radio requires a headset connected to the microUSB port of the phone, so we were unable to use the standard headphones in the 3.5mm jack for listening to the FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M7500 Emporio Armani video player does not offer plenty of features but it has the essentials - it plays MPEG4 and 3GP files. Other than that, you can fast-forward or rewind videos, and you can watch them fullscreen in landscape mode. You can also show or hide the controller panel in portrait mode, yet the features remain active throughout.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio Quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the audio quality of Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani isn't as impressive as we hoped. The distinct music focus of the handset and Samsung's great track record had us hoping for superb audio. Instead, the Samsung M7500 produced only about average scores on most readings, including stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We might be a bit too fussy since Samsung have spoiled us but it certainly isn't their best work. Furthermore the frequency response of the Emporio Armani handset came as a shock to us. The phone seems to have some filters that cut off extreme low and high sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now this is probably the one area of the review where you should take our words with a pinch of salt. Samsung handsets have traditionally done well in our audio quality tests, so the problem with the M7500 may be attributed to the pre-release status of our unit. Anyway, here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Now that's a nice snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M7500 has a 3 megapixel autofocus camera with a maximum image resolution of 2048x1536 pixels; unfortunately though, the camera lacks a flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera uses the usual non-smartphone interface and follows the current trend of displaying settings with icons in a toolbar at the top of the screen, while options appear as drop-down menus. The settings are extensive and include picture size, shooting mode (single, smile shot, continuous, panorama, mosaic and frame shot), color effects (black and white, negative, sepia, etc.), white balance, and resolution setting. The camera can be used in landscape mode only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smile Shot is the only extra that sets the Emporio Armani phone apart from other 3 megapixel phone cameras by Samsung. Sony Ericsson have only recently started to implement it in their Cyber-shot cameraphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smile shot works in two steps. The first step requires you to press the shutter key all the way down and then frame the person you would like to take a photo of. Then the camera starts to track the face until the person smiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is not necessary to have a huge smile for the camera to recognize it, but sadly it works a little slow and it has a tendency to miss the perfect time for the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is surprisingly good and we are glad to find very low noise levels even in shots taken indoors. The smooth images have mild sharpening with more than enough detail. There is still some loss of fine detail due to the somewhat hard-hitting noise reduction but nothing too disturbing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples produced by the 3 MP AF camera of the Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there is a couple of images downsized to 1024x768 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the video recording capabilities of the camera. The Samsung M7500 shoots video in the so-called Camcorder mode. The user interface of the camcorder doesn't differ from the one of the still camera except for some of the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you get is QCIF resolution at 15fps, which is only good for an occasional MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A separate list of settings is in charge of the exposure metering, shutter sound, quality, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity and web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani you can count on quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support while HSDPA provides fast data connections. In addition, the phone also supports USB and stereo Bluetooth, both versions 2.0. A 3.5 mm audio jack completes the wired connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone offers a scaled down NetFront v3.4 web browser, familiar from other Samsung phones. It has basic functionality, lacking important features like landscape/full screen views, and struggles with elaborate pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the few nice features are the page size, search-in-page option and the virtual mouse pointer. If you browse elaborate pages, the desktop view mode is more appropriate, while for simple sites it's better to use the smart-fit view.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Adequate organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. There are five types of events available: appointment, anniversary, holiday, important, and private.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The calendar with standard functionality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five alarm slots, each with a variety of configurable options - snooze time, repetition, etc. You can, of course, choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level. It's also possible to use a predefined FM radio station to wake you up, which is a nice option for those of you who love surprises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other standard offerings to be found in almost every other Samsung phone are memo, task, world clock, calculator, and a unit converter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the other applications, the phone is equipped with the usual stuff: a voice recorder, a timer, a stopwatch and an RSS reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other apps need no further explanation, so here are some screenshots just for illustration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic document viewer works well with office files such as .xls, .doc, .pdf and loads the full version of the documents quickly and with no lag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To open a file, you need to access it via the file browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the nice options of the document viewer are the full screen view, fit to screen option (page, width and height) and search tool, which can quickly guide you to a specific paragraph or chunk of text you are looking for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games: a few Java titles to try and buy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typically for Samsung, all the java games preinstalled on the M7500 Emporio Armani phone are trial titles. The games the phone bundles are Asphalt 3, Brain Challenge Vol2, Midnight Pool, Tetris Mania and World Series of Poker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We love the Asphalt game the most since you get to do more than simply ride and race for the first place. You receive bonuses for crashing other cars, collecting nitro credits, and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brain Challenge Vol2 is quite an entertaining game and involves solving mathematical problems, memory games and pattern recognition exercises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Midnight Pool, Tetris Mania and the Poker are well-known games that most other Samsung phones come equipped with.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani is clearly directed at the fashion market, a phone for people who care about style and image. By the way, that image thing is perhaps big enough for Samsung too. Simply having Armani in their portfolio may well be as important as the number of co-branded handsets they ship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M7500 Emporio Armani feature set is nothing special, exactly the kind of thing you'd find on any run of the mill mid-range handset, but that's unlikely to matter to the people who buy this phone. For them it's a phone to be seen with, something to show off at the club or when they are out on the town. This is a phone designed to stand out in the crowd, and there's no doubt that the flashing lights and the Armani branding will get you noticed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately (or quite luckily, if your wallet is who you are), style comes with a hefty price tag. Yes, it does offer some music features, such as the dedicated music keys and the 3.5mm audio jack, but it still lacks the capabilities of the other music-centric phones of the Samsung Beat range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M7500 Armani occupies a unique niche in the market, a fashion phone that 'rocks'. It's certainly not cheap but if music and fashion are your life, you could do a lot worse than the M7500.</paragraph>
