			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 710 has a tall task at hand. The second brainchild of the Nokia- Microsoft partnership is the budget-friendly option in the lineup. It will try to entice first time smartphone buyers, while battling the Windows Phone establishment in the face of HTC and Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the upscale Nokia Lumia 800 is clearly the object of more attention for its impressive build and superior features, the Lumia 710 is expected to sell in bigger numbers and perhaps bring higher profits. From a business perspective, the smartphone is even more important than its flagship sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just don't take the budget reference to Nokia Lumia 710 at face value. Because of Microsoft's strict hardware requirements for the Windows Phone platform, the smartphone has the same 1.4GHz Scorpion CPU and 512MB of RAM as the Lumia 800, therefore promising identically smooth handling. In order to maintain the budget status and keep the price down, Nokia Lumia 710 has less built-in memory, an LCD screen instead of AMOLED, and a 5MP camera. Its design is less ambitious than the flagship's, but the Lumia 710 is still solidly built, even if not as good looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of equipment sets the Nokia Lumia 710 on a collision course with two major rivals in the Windows Phone realm - the Samsung Omnia W/Focus Flash and HTC Radar. The Finnish offering however, has a few exclusive software tricks up its sleeve, which are expected to give it a slight edge over its rivals. The most prominent of course, being Nokia Drive - the exclusive and free lifetime navigation service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as hardware goes, the three devices are almost identical, save for the screen technology and choice of finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we are going to continue our encounter with Nokia Lumia 710 with an unboxing, followed by the design and build quality overview.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Nokia Lumia 710<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like its better equipped sibling, the Nokia Lumia 710 comes in a fairly large box. As far as contents go however, there are no surprises. Inside the box, you will find the phone, a charger and microUSB cable, as well as a set of nice earbuds. Several booklets are also present.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional accessories such as changeable colored back panels and a case would have certainly been a welcome addition to Lumia 710's box. Even in its current state however, it will have your most essential needs covered.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 710 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The measures of Nokia Lumia 710 come at 119 x 62.4 x 12.5 mm, while it tips the scale at the acceptable 125 grams. The Lumia 710 is lighter than its upscale sibling - but doesn't feel flimsy compared to the polycarbonate unibody of the Lumia 800.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the Nokia Lumia 800 is essentially a clone of the Meego running N9, the Lumia 710 copies some pages from the Symbian design book. It's easy to spot a resemblance to the Nokia C7. In a world where generic designs are becoming more and more common, the Lumia 710 still manages to look different - and unmistakably Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the Nokia Lumia 710, compared to one of its direct rivals - the Super AMOLED packing Samsung Omnia W.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the all-plastic construction, the Nokia Lumia 710 feels extremely well put together. We can't help but note though, that the phone looks a bit cheap next to its metal clad Samsung and HTC rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two color schemes available for the device - black and white. Interestingly enough, the main color refers only to the front of the device. Meaning you can choose between a black and a white body. On top of that, there's a selection of exchangeable rear covers in various colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 features a ClearBlack LCD screen of WVGA resolution. With a pixel density of 252ppi, the display is as good as it gets on a Windows Phone handset. Its contrast and viewing angles are better than most typical LCD units we've covered, but fall seriously short of AMOLED standards. We also found the screen of the Lumia to have a more or less annoying yellowish tint when viewed from an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710's screen showed impressive contrast ratios of over 1000:1, but most of that was due to the relatively high brightness of the screen (nearly 700 nits at maximum). The black levels were pretty good for a mid-range LCD-packing phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the Lumia 710 stacks up against the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, you will find the three typical Windows Phone buttons, which look like one giant hardware key. In a rather interesting fashion, the mouthpiece is also located on the front, below the display, rather than on the bottom side of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is where the earpiece ambient light and proximity sensors reside. There is no front-facing camera on the Lumia 710.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing but a small latch for removing the battery cover on the left side of the Lumia 710. On the right side, you will find the volume rocker and the dedicated camera button of the device. It's a shame the half-press is nearly nonexistent. It will take quite some practice to get it right. The half press is very shallow, and the key itself is rather stiff. With almost no clear stop between half and full press we ended up with plenty of unusable shots before we finally hit the right amount of gentle pressure needed. Touch focus is available too but we're not particularly fond of it since it also snaps the image, so focusing and recomposing is not possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least, the camera key on the Nokia Lumia 710 will power up the camera even when the phone is locked. It's fairly quick too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the Lumia 710 is where the unprotected 3.5 mm audio jack and microUSB ports are. The power/lock key is there as well. There is nothing but a lanyard eyelet on the bottom of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the matte plastic back of the Nokia Lumia 710 is where the 5MP camera and LED flash can be found. The loudspeaker grille is there as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you remove the battery cover, you will find the battery and the microSIM slot - no surprises there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 scored an endurance rating of only 27 hours in our battery test, which was fairly disappointing. It managed just over 9 hours of 3G talk time, beating both the Lumia 800 and its official rating, but it failed to break the 4 hour barrier in both the video playback and the web browsing test. You can get more details on how the Lumia 710 did from our blog post.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia smartphones have always been a pleasure to handle and the Lumia 710 is no exception. The matte plastic cover on the back is quite grippy and helps you avoid accidental drops. With its pocket friendly measures, the phone can be operated easily with one hand as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we found little to frown about the smartphone's build quality. The design is rather simple but likely to appeal to a wide audience of potential users. The interchangeable back covers should help its cause even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is now time to take a look at the software secrets of Nokia Lumia 710. Don't expect to find any surprises here though - the device is absolutely identical to the Lumia 800.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock Windows Phone Mango interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia left the Windows Phone interface untouched in the Lumia 800 and the same holds for the Lumia 710 and even the upcoming 900. This wins them points for consistency (Android topped with a custom launcher by each can cause some confusion), but goes nowhere in terms of setting the product apart from its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Windows phone ecosystem, the difference comes with the preloaded software, which is one of the highlights of the Nokia Lumia 710 as we'll see later on (you guessed it, it's mainly the SatNav app, Nokia Drive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we begin, here's a video demo of the Nokia Lumia 710 in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device and reveals the live-tile Metro user interface. It's a very fluid vertical grid of Live tiles that can be reordered the way you like. Practically any app can be placed in the grid by holding your finger over it and selecting the Pin to start option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a clean and simple interface. The Live tile of each app shows info relevant to the app's function - stuff such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts, but that's a bit oversimplifying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Windows Phone Mango the Live tiles are quicker and offer more info. For example, the Pictures tile shows an animated slideshow of your images. The Group tile lists friend updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, a thing we really like about Windows Phone is that you can wake the phone and jump straight into the camera by pressing and holding the camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access all installed apps by going into the application list. Apps are alphabetically sorted there and you have a virtual Search button to make finding apps easier for those with many apps installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 710 comes with 7.5 Mango and its crowing feature is multitasking. It's not true multitasking; things are being done the iOS way. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch between apps you press and hold the Back key (that's right, the Back key, not the Windows key). The app switcher itself looks similar to that of Symbian or WebOS: thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to exactly how you left it. Usually, the last 5-6 apps are here. You can't "kill" any of those apps, this is more of a history of the recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, as you open more apps, the old ones start to drop out of the list. Once an app is gone, you have to launch it again the old-fashioned way, which means you'll need to start over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, apps with active background tasks (e.g. streaming online radio) will keep on working.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking can be disabled in the settings to save on battery life. There you'll also find a list of all installed apps that support multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu reveals two sets of options - system and applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Applications settings let you configure individual each app you have installed on the device - the People hub, Phone, Maps and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7.5 can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate a text, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too (*cough*Android*cough*) but voice commands are a big part of iOS (and a loudly touted one at that), so WP7.5 can brag about it too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>People hub is a phonebook and SNS powerhouse<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first tab of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone, social network, email - everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and they can be displayed as First Last or Last, First, you can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to make the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of setting favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access just like regular contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations (there's more location goodness coming on later). You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single contact. Under their profile photo, there are actions - call mobile, text mobile, write on wall, view website and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and messages just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting addition is the new History tab. The complete history of exchange with a contact is in one place listed by day. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 had no reception issues, even in areas with spotty coverage. The in-call sound is good and loud enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Lumia 710 did good in recognizing our commands, though it did have trouble guessing the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name of "Mandark".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist - it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What's missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone - a feature some of you might miss (it can be done, but it's hard). You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen and for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note: status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did our traditional loudspeaker test on the Nokia Lumia 710 and it got a Below Average mark. It's rather quiet (though a little louder than the Lumia 800), so you need to keep it very close at hand or you might miss calls. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is WP7's strong suit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging was heavily retooled for version 7.5. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages. We hear Microsoft will be adding Skype soon too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing about Windows Phone is that the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech bubbles and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are placed only when the conversation moves to a different platform so it's not cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which platform to use for the reply and the text box will remind you what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't attach anything to Facebook messages, you'll need to use MMS for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as you would expect, by letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email where Mango contributed too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7.5 delivers a unified inbox for email, a highly requested feature. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation view was expected - it lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. We expected to be able to swipe between the messages, but that wasn't the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes - that's it. The layout remains consistent across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no vibration though and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. New functionality allows apps to integrate into the Pictures hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that in apps however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Pictures hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, and displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your Favorites section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't choose what albums the individual camera roll photos go to, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends so that their Facebook galleries get displayed right there in your Pictures hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll unifies your entire collection of photos and videos, taken with the device, in a grid of 4x5. You cannot change the layout. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or pinch . We appreciate it that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 used to be quite restricted when it came to sharing - it's still not perfect (photos get downsized before emailing, for one) but you can now share videos too, either via email or on Facebook. Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook or the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo. It's a nice feature but one that produces unrealistic results at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as a background for the hub or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Pictures hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a time scroll and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn't recognize .AVI files - in other words, don't expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 - so, you can watch those formats on the Lumia 710, it's just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer's capabilities).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen - like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music + Videos and Nokia Music too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which sports the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, giving you quick access to the last two items played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen to/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them more like categories you can assign your videos to when synching with Zune. The third section is podcasts where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has a simple and straightforward interface, you won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The favorite, repeat and shuffle buttons are located next to the album cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get radio and marketplace links in the Music &amp; Videos tile. It doesn't offer the option to listen to online radio so you would need to insert the headgear to get reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the current frequency in very large digits - swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction. You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Music works as a general music player but with a location-aware twist. You also get access to the Nokia Music store, which is an alternative to the Zune Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs lined up - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The location-aware feature is called Gigs - as the name suggests, it finds concerts near your location.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have to admit the Nokia Lumia 710 audio output really caught us off guard. There are no smartphones with flawless audio, but the Lumia 710 was too poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is way off with both headphones and an active external equalizer. The intermodulation distortion was also the worst we have seen for quite some time. Now add the really low volume levels and you get the kind of output you expect from a $50 phone, not a mid-range device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other readings are mostly good, but with so many weak points we are anything but happy with the Lumia 710 overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here comes the table so you can see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>An okay 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 has a 5MP camera (photos have a maximum resolution of 2592x1944) coupled with an LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera. Alternatively, you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers very extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness, ISO and more. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key will wake the phone with a single press - that is unlock it and start the camera. There's an option that prevents the shutter key from starting the camera if the proximity sensor is triggered (to prevent accidental launches when the phone is in your pocket). This option is off by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem here is that the shutter key is rather uncomfortable, the half-press is especially uncomfortable (we often pressed the key all the way down before the camera had even started to focus).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 710 may not have a premium camera, but it does pretty well for a 5MP unit. Noise is kept in check, although fine detail like foliage gets smeared away by the postprocessing. The camera tends to underexpose dark areas, but highlights are preserved for the most part. Colors are accurate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go some Nokia Lumia 710 full-res camera samples:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 steps up in our photo quality compare tool to face other 5MP shooters. The tool's page will give you more information on what to look out for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 710 does very well in the synthetic resolution chart and shows no signs of pink spot. In the second chart, the noise patch on the right has turned into a mostly uniform grey after the post processing, though the gravel and grass patches are still recognizable. The third chart shows good colors, but reveals a slight yellow to green tint.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording can be great, continuous AF struggles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the still camera's and has plenty of features too. You can use scenes, set contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also apply image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 shoots video with up to 720p resolution, which is now within reach for most smartphones. Still, it's quality, not quantity that we're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is available while recording but that often turns from a benefit into a disadvantage. The Lumia 710 was way too eager to refocus - if there's constant action in the scene, the 710 would look for focus every several seconds, which gets really annoying. There's no way to lock focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Lumia 800 (and a lot of other phones too), the 710 shoots videos with varying framerate. We've seen anything from 25fps (usually in dark scenes) to 30fps (in well-lit scenes). And depending on which framerate it goes for, you would get either a smooth or a slightly choppy video. The Nokia Lumia 710 should be okay when shooting fast-paced scenes, provided there's enough light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is really good - as good as the Lumia 800, but the 710 suffers from some of the same issues. Videos look crisp and have a lot of detail and there's no noise or artifacts. It helps that videos are shot with a bitrate of 14Mbps, about the same as the Lumia 800. Very little of that bitrate goes to the sound though - it's stereo sound but at a very low bitrate (it hovers around 50Kbps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Nokia would fix the autofocus issue and bump up the audio bitrate, we'd be very happy with the video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an example of what the Nokia Lumia 710 is capable of.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's time for the Nokia Lumia 710 to go into our video quality comparison database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our setup shows the Lumia 710 captured a great level of detail, enough to beat a poorly performing 1080p shooter. In poor lighting conditions the videos are rather dark, but they still have decent amounts of detail. The third chart shows excellent resolution (better than most other WP7 phones) but also a slight hint of a pink spot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and 3G with HSPA (14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink). The 3G bands vary by region.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n and stereo Bluetooth 2.1. Bluetooth is currently limited in what it can do - there's no file transfer support, for one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Computer sync is done with the desktop Zune application. It's the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your Windows Phone - there's no Mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync files with Zune over the USB cable and Wi-Fi. There's a Mac version of it available too - the Windows Phone 7 Connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional SD storage isn't available on Windows Phone so the Lumia 710 doesn't offer such an option. Plus, it only packs 8GB of built-in storage, which some might find limiting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get SkyDrive for free though. It's a Microsoft service that gives you 25GB of cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 710 can act as Wi-Fi hotspot and share its data connection with other devices. All you need is an active microSIM card with a data plan and you're all set.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer Mobile is fast, HTML-only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the browser is really simple. The address bar at the bottom is always visible, but the status bar is hidden, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate. Next to the address bar is the refresh button. You can, of course, bring up the extended menu, which offers a great deal of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address bar also serves as a search bar, which is a handy shortcut for looking things up if you're not sure which site exactly will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended menu offers tabs, recent, favorites, add to favorites, share page, pin to start and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history but it also has a very neat option to choose a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The six tab ceiling in from the original release of the OS hasn't been lifted - it's not too bad, but competing OSes don't have such limitations. We were also hoping to see text reflow, but no luck on that either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser relies on hardware graphic acceleration to provide smoother graphics (and video) and animation and the JavaScript engine has been retooled as well. Overall, browsing with the Internet Explorer Mobile is a smooth experience. However, if you like numbers you won't be impressed by the performance of WP7.5 in benchmarks - it's well below the performance of phones like the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing search does OCR and track ID too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you search on Bing, one of the things that might be offered as a relevant result is an app from the Marketplace. For example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also grew two other handy search modes - song recognition and barcode scanner. In other OSes these features typically come in the form of third party apps, but with WP7.5 you get those natively as part of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera scanner can also snap a photo of text, perform OCR and translate it into another language.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, Bing does regular web searches for pages or images and can look for interesting locations nearby.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Marketplace keeps growing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Marketplace is playing catch up with the Apple App store and the Android Market. Just before last year ended, Marketplace passed the 50,000 app mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace is organized into three main sections - applications, games and music. Another one called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything over 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (it costs 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>App Highlights is preloaded by Nokia. It offers an assortment of apps into several categories to give you a start. The first category is actually called Starter kit - a list of what are considered vital apps (e.g. YouTube, Netflix, etc.), then there's Addictive (games go there), Health+ and Foodies have apps to help you stay fit or indulge yourself respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is accelerometer-enabled and can reshuffle the lists of applications every time you shake the phone, which is a fun way to find new apps. Also, the tile for the app would occasionally change to promote some of the apps it recommends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the try option, which is available to many games and apps. It lets you try before you buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as a what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace. We did test games like Need for Speed, Kinectimals, Angry birds and had no problems with the Nokia Lumia 710, the 1.4GHz processor and Adreno 205 GPU were more than adequate in handling more complex graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All WP7 phones use more or less the same hardware (slight differences in CPU clock speed are possible), so any WP7 will run on any WP7 phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps for basic mapping, location-based services<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic mapping solution in Windows Phone is Bing Maps. They have driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free, but they're not a match for Nokia's bespoke applications (we'll discuss them in the next section).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not quite voice-guided navigation. Here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that are easy to read. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though, it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all the new Maps can do for you though. The app will locate nearby points of interest with the new feature called Local Scout and it will even show you indoor maps of malls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from an "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature of Local scout lets you pin places to your homescreen. So let's say you like a pub and like to check it out from time to time, get news, call for a reservation - it's right there on your homescreen - that's neat.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps and Nokia Drive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It takes the Nokia Lumia 710 about a minute to get GPS lock and you can make that even faster if you have a data connection for the A-GPS. Wi-Fi and Cell-ID positioning are also available if you only need a rough idea of your whereabouts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps wasn't preinstalled on our unit, but grabbing it from the Marketplace is a simple operation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps is an alternative to Microsoft's Bing Maps. It lets you view maps in three different modes - map, satellite and public transport. You can use pinch zoom to navigate the map (you can also enable old-school zoom controls) and panning around is fast and smooth. Nokia Maps does only 2D mode - there's no 3D option like Google Maps has for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It pulls its maps from the Internet, so you'll need an Internet connection to use it. Yes, even if you have downloaded offline maps for Nokia Drive (which we found to be weird).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the more interesting part of the duo, the Nokia Drive, unlike Maps, lets you easily download maps for offline usage for any country in the world - free of charge, of course. Bigger countries are split into pieces, if you don't want to waste your limited internal memory with maps you'll never need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps aren't that big - the map for the whole of the US is 1.9GB, while the map for the entire UK, for example, is 274MB. The 8GB of built-in memory is more than enough for any trip you're likely to take. It's easy to delete unneeded maps or download new ones on the go wherever there is Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One rather annoying problem right now is that Drive can't plan routes in offline mode - you can browse the map, but not start a new route. There's a fix from Nokia incoming though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drive does support a 3D view, unlike Maps. It also has 3D landmarks for some of the bigger world cities. You can also use 2D mode if that's what you prefer, but in 3D you get to see further down the road than in 2D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than 2D/3D, settings are pretty scarce - you can toggle daylight and night color schemes, choose whether landmarks should be displayed and choose a voice for the navigation. Many voices in a number of languages are available for free download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were hoping for options to fine-tune the routing algorithm - like avoid toll roads, find fastest or shortest route and so on - but there were none to be had. You just set your destination (with an option to review the planned route before you go), hit start and you're off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While navigating, you can zoom in and out depending on you preference to see more of the road ahead or more details. At the top of the screen is an instruction for the next turn in big, easy to read white on blue letters and a big icon noting the turn. At the bottom of the screen you have the time remaining and current speed. Those get pushed to the left side of the screen in portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like Nokia Drive's no-distraction's approach to navigation, but we are used to having more control over how the route is planned. A few other options would have been welcome too (the Symbian version of Nokia's SatNav solution is very feature-rich).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Lumia 710 beats all non-Nokia Windows Phone handsets on the market . The free voice-guided navigation might be just what it takes to convince people to go for the Lumia 710, instead of competing WP phones - at least in that price range.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured Office<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Mango, SkyDrive integration is one thing that was improved. Now, docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive. In case you missed it, Microsoft are offering free 25GB of storage with each SkyDrive account (but individual files are limited to 100MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more - the Locations tab replaces the old SharePoint tab. This lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through SharePoint or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Locations and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub got better too - it grew the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors. Still the innovation that Mango has brought to Windows Phone Office is great and shows Microsoft is dedicated to improving the Office experience further.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is simple to use and has an iOS-esque interface. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone Mango provides users with the basics in PIM but should you need anything more the Marketplace is there too - it offers apps for just about everything - most of which are free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an app called Contacts Transfer, which does just that - it pairs with another phone over Bluetooth and leeches out your address book. This makes switching from your old phone to the Nokia Lumia 710 a smooth sailing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your Nokia Lumia 710 might come with some more regional apps preinstalled. For example, the British version comes with a British Airways app and another one called Ministry of Sound.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WindowsPhone.com remotely protects your data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone website is the cloud of sorts for all WP7 smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to use the site is register your email (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) and then setup an account on your Windows Phone device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options given to you on the windowsphone.com website are limited to billing information and security. You can update your billing information, view the apps you've bought and go to the web version of the WP Marketplace and buy new apps. Take note that they will be sent to your phone to be downloaded locally on the device, unlike on the Zune app for your PC or Mac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The features most important to users are the Find, Ring, Lock or Erase. To use them you'll have to input a phone number out of a total of 37 countries supported. After you've done this the website will have access to your phone's location so you'll be able to pinpoint its almost exact location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features are pretty self-explanatory. Ring will use your phone's ringtone to send a single if you've lost it around the house, Lock will lock it with a 4-digit PIN code and Erase will wipe all your sensitive data off the device so you don't have to worry about it falling into undesirable hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn't like about the windowsphone.com cloud is that it doesn't allow wireless sync like on the iCloud, for example. We just think that any cloud-based service should offer this. Also the number of countries that allow tracking your device is limited and many countries where WP is available won't have access to these much-needed features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the website includes guides on each individual feature of your phone and depending on where you live there's a very detailed list of providers and operators that offer WP handsets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 has to share what's left of the spotlight with its Lumia 800 sibling - the one with the fancy unibody and AMOLED screen. Looks aside though, the two aren't that different and the 710 does come cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen could have been better - in terms of viewing angles in particular - but it stacks up very well against mid-range competition. The camera was also pretty good, especially the HD video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we didn't spend too much time crying over the non-unibody design, easy access to the battery makes up for that (and you get the added bonus of being able to spruce things up with a colorful new back cover).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 has certain limitations: storage is non-expandable, and 8GB isn't spectacular to begin with. USB and Bluetooth usability is limited too, but those are par for the Windows Phone course. And only two other devices come with free voice-guided navigation, both of which are Nokia made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is the Nokia Lumia 800, of course. It has a polycarbonate unibody and an AMOLED screen (with a PenTile matrix though), a higher-res still camera and double the storage. The other is the Lumia 900, which boasts a 4.3" AMOLED with a full set of pixels and LTE connectivity. That will be exclusive to AT&amp;T for a while when it launches though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia Lumia 800 &#x2022; Nokia Lumia 900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Omnia W I8350 (or Focus Flash I677 in the US) is a direct competitor to the Lumia 710. Its 3.7" screen is a Super AMOLED and the phone is thinner and lighter despite its metal back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar is also in the game, with a slightly bigger (3.8") S-LCD screen and an aluminum unibody (which means the battery is inaccessible). It only has a 1GHz CPU though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might also want to look around for an Acer Allegro - it's only available in some countries and has some disadvantages (1GHz CPU, the LCD screen is 3.6") but if it's available in your area, you should be able to find it at a lower price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing to note is that, unlike the Finns, these three use regular-sized SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Omnia W I8350 &#x2022; HTC Radar &#x2022; Acer Allegro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn't have to be a Windows Phone handset - there are other alternatives outside the leading platforms, iOS and Android. The Samsung S8600 Wave 3 runs Bada and packs a 4" Super AMOLED in its 9.9mm thin body, which is mostly metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may be old school, but Symbian Belle is very usable and the Nokia 701 offers an amazingly bright display (1,000 nits, though it's smaller and lower res - 3.5" nHD), a metal build and Nokia's free voice-guided navigation (with richer settings to boot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung S8600 Wave 3 &#x2022; Nokia 701</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 710 is competing in a very tough game. Mid-range WP7 handsets have virtually identical specs and clear advantages over competitors are hard to come by. The Lumia 710 carries Nokia's pedigree and some exclusive software, which have a lot of appeal, but newcomers to the brand might not be so easily convinced. However, in a world full of ageing Symbian smartphones, there should be plenty of business for the Lumia 710.</paragraph>
