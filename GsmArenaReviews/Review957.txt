		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>"Mini" is the hot keyword for phones - a natural response to the pocket-busting 5" inch trend of this flagship generation. With the same premium aluminum unibody, the UltraPixel camera and BoomSound speakers, the HTC One mini can proudly bear its father's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has come down from 4.7" to 4.3" and the height and width of the device have shrunk accordingly. Combined with the lower weight, the One mini feels much smaller than the One, maybe even enough to seduce some iPhone users who have had it with the small 4" screen. The screen resolution of the One mini is 720p, which still helps it to 342ppi density (better than Retina).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A smaller phone means less space for components. The first piece to feel the effect is the battery which has lost 500 mAh of its capacity and is down to 1,800mAh. HTC also went with a Snapdragon 400 chipset, which offers a dual-core Krait 300 CPU downclocked to 1.4GHz (it's typically at 1.7GHz) and an Adreno 305 GPU. The RAM has also got cut down to 1GB, which would have any multi-tasker raise an eye-brow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few other pieces missing, here's the rundown of both the good and the bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We understand the chipset choice (though the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini runs the CPU at 1.7GHz). We even understand dropping the Optical Image Stabilization, as even the big HTC Butterfly S doesn't have it. The company also dropped the NFC and MHL connectivity along with the IR blaster. The non-expandable 16GB of storage makes us wish HTC would offer a 32GB version, even if it's just to know we have options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individually, those are understandable choices, but the Galaxy S4 mini has expandable storage, NFC and IR. Do all the dropped features mean the One mini is really just a fancier midrange phone rather than the compact high-end phone we wanted?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We won't lie, the aluminum unibody of the HTC One mini is great - it screams "premium" more than the big Galaxy S4, let alone its mini version. And the stereo BoomSound speakers on the front deliver an excellent audio experience, coupled with high-quality audio hardware for the 3.5mm audio jack and Beats audio tuning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throw in an UltraPixel camera sensor and the latest Android 4.2.2 with Sense 5 (on par with the just updated regular One) and the feeling that HTC shortchanged the One mini almost subsides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We won't let it off that easy, though. We have both the HTC One and One mini in front of us to make sure Junior lives up to the name in all departments.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the One mini<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini came with the exact same accessories as the HTC One - a compact charger with a detachable microUSB cable, a SIM ejector tool and a one-piece headset with spare tips. The headset is an in-ear design and has cool red accents and flat, tangle-resistant cables.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC One mini 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini measures 132 x 63.2 x 9.3 mm compared to 137.4 x 68.2 x 9.3 mm for the big HTC One. It doesn't sound like much of a difference, but you can really feel it when you hold the One mini in your hand, especially the width. It has also shed some weight and now weighs 122g (the One is 143g).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini is little else, but a downscaled One on the outside - premium aluminum, with the solid feel of a unibody phone all whipped into an attractive design. While the 5" Butterfly S went with polycarbonate (perhaps due to weight considerations), the HTC One mini should earn as much praise for its design as the regular One did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mini also differs from the One in the polycarbonate strip that runs along the sides of the phone. The regular One has it too, but the one on the mini is thicker, covering the entire sides. We think this is an advantage - plastic can take a knock, while aluminum is more brittle (it dents and its paint peels off more easily when hit). We wish HTC had used the same matte plastic as on the One, this one is glossy and doesn't look quite as good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cutting down "only" 5mm from the height and width of the HTC One to make the mini might not sound like much, but that's because it's difficult to picture. In reality, the One mini feels noticeably more compact than its bigger siblings. It's roughly the size of last year's HTC One S, which is impressive as you are getting a pair of stereo speakers at the front.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The screen is gorgeous - with 720p resolution it's not quite as sharp as the 1080p screen on the One, but at this size, spotting the difference takes some effort. It has great viewing angles and great colors too. Speaking of colors, the screen on our One mini has a warmer white balance than the screen on our HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the two screens under a microscope:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC One mini ? HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini screen is very similar to that of the regular HTC One. The brightness is very high, higher than even the big One, let alone AMOLED screens. The contrast is amazing, making for one of the better viewing experiences on a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is fairly reflective though, which hurts its sunlight legibility. It's this reflectivity that brings down the sunlight lebibility noticably below the level set by the HTC One. It's not by much, but it's enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 mini screen brightness is not that high, but the lower reflectivity makes its display much easier to read out in the sun.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We find the One mini screen to be worthy of the One name, unlike the uninspiring qHD unit of the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the HTC One mini follows the established design used by the regular One and the Butterfly S. The whole front panel is protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass 3, which is the latest generation of the protective glass, and should do a nice job of keeping scratches away or at least make them less visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two capacitive keys below the screen - Back and Home - and a speaker on either side of the display. Next to the top speaker is the front-facing camera (1.6MP / 720p) along with proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Android version 4.2.2 you can long press the Home key to activate the Menu, instead of having an on-screen button that eats into the usable screen space. The HTC One got this as an update, but the mini stayed in the R&amp;D lab long enough to get it out of the box (actually, it was part of the pre-release software for the One too, until HTC decided to remove it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the HTC One mini features the Power/Lock key (sorry, no IR function this time around), the 3.5mm audio jack and one of the two mics. The bottom of the phone holds the second mic along with the microUSB port (note that this port isn't MHL-enabled like on the HTC One).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two mics are used for stereo recording in videos but work with Sense Voice too. This feature keeps track of how loud the environment is during a call and ups the gain on the mic to make sure the other side can hear you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the One mini is where the microSIM card tray goes. The right side has two volume buttons instead of a single rocker key, an uncommon design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We get to the back. Aluminum spans the entire surface (save for two thin plastic strips) and comes in either naked metallic grey or in painted black (at launch anyway, we might see a Red version later on). The camera and its flash are the main points of interest on the back, but the Beats Audio logo reminds you that the phone provides a high-end audio experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, back to the camera. It has a 1/3" UltraPixel sensor with 4MP resolution (16:9 aspect ratio). UltraPixel refers to the larger than usual pixels on the sensor - 2 microns on a side, bigger than the standard 1.4 micron and 1.1 micron pixels in most other cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extra large pixels, the backside Illuminated (BSI) sensor design and the fast F/2.0 lens promise great low-light performance. The LED flash can be fired in one out of five power levels, depending on how close you are to your subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the HTC One mini uses the same ImageChip 2 as the big One. This chip handles a lot of the special processing needed by the camera (so the less powerful chipset shouldn't matter), including recording 3 second videos each time you take a photo in Zoe mode. These videos are stitched into cool 30 second Video highlights. The chip also records what is necessary for the Always Smile and Object Removal options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's missing is the Optical Image Stabilization - outside the flagship Nokia Lumia phones, the HTC One was the only phone to offer it. It remains its exclusive feature though as even the big HTC Butterfly S doesn't have it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini features a 1,800 mAh battery, which helped it achieve an endurance rating of 40h in our test. That's not a particularly great score, but it still means you will be able to go through a day of usage with no trouble.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface catches up to Android 4.2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini runs Android 4.2.2 with Sense 5, which is right on par with the big One. The software includes the exclusive BlinkFeed and Zoe features. Here's a quick showcase of the HTC One mini hardware and software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Sense goes against the grain of most Android custom launchers and relies heavily on vertical scrolling, which can take some getting used to if you're coming from a different brand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is the first place you'd encounter it - it's a stream of articles from around the web (HTC has partnered with 10,000 providers), combined with account updates on services like Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap on an item you get a preview with one big picture and a short blurb. Social networking items open the respective app instead. You can also search BlinkFeed and post updates to social networks straight from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that BlinkFeed will use some data to update, but you can set it to update over Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is a part of the homescreen - the leftmost pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can long press on the homescreen or do a pinch zoom out gesture to enter edit mode. Here you can add and remove homescreen panes, rearrange existing ones and set one of them as Home (the Home buttons brings you there). The only limitation is that you can't remove or rearrange the BlinkFeed pane, which is always the leftmost homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is the second place where HTC went with vertical scrolling instead of the more popular horizontal pane interface. The drawer displays a 3 x 4 grip of shortcuts by default (which leaves a lot of padding around icons). You can use folders to group similar apps and make better use of the screen space. The other option is to switch to a 4 x 5 grid in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that to access the settings in the app drawer and BlinkFeed you have to swipe down. The One mini doesn't have a Menu button, but you can assign the long press action of the Home button to cover for it. If you do that, you'll give up its default purpose of opening Google Now - which will be a swipe up gesture instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the app drawer is a big clock with date and weather info (a big icon and smaller text with more details). This same clock is at the top of the BlinkFeed screen, which makes the two feel very similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcut dock at the bottom holds four shortcuts plus the app drawer button in the middle. These icons are always visible - in BlinkFeed, in the regular screens, in the app drawer, even on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is pretty much stock Android - it shows only notifications by default (below the top row, which is reserved for the time and date, plus two shortcuts). As of Android 4.2.2, Sense 5 also has toggles in the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty, courtesy of Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, is the widget lockscreen. It's disabled by default, you have to toggle it on from the Personalize menu. Unlike the stock variety, you only get to pick a single widget, there are no multiple pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widget lockscreen is much like the default one with a big clock and a weather icon, along with four quick shortcuts - you drag them up and release to launch the app they point to, just like the unlocking gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has fiddled with the app switcher - it is now launched by double tapping the Home key (unless you set that to be launching the in-app Menu, then it's a swipe up gesture) and it shows a 3 x 3 grid of thumbnails of the recent apps. The upside is that you don't have to scroll like you do in the regular app switcher, the downside is that you can't scroll - you only get to see the last 9 apps an no more (for some that's quite enough). You can swipe up to dismiss an app (which leaves an empty slot, an older app doesn't fill its place).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an interesting option in the phone's Security settings, borrowed from Windows Phone 8. It's called Kid mode and is actually an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they can have access to. One annoying bit is that to enable Kid mode the first time around, you need to sign up via email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini also comes with a dedicated Car mode screen, which has been styled to look like the rest of the interface. There are only five big controls besides the clock and weather info. There's music info too, which takes a whole row by itself, along with shortcuts to Navigation, Dialer, the Music player (again) and Voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense customizations also extend to the Settings menu - HTC has prettified it a bit with custom icons and added several new options (like Media output and Personalize).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're upgrading from another phone, you should give the Setup app a spin. It hooks up to your old phone over Bluetooth and pulls all the data it can, even things that Google doesn't sync (settings and such, not just the contacts). This also works for phones that can't sync with Google, like various feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini has half the number of CPU cores (clocked lower to boot) and half the RAM of its bigger, premium sibling. Still, even with Sense on top, the phone ran its Android 4.2 operating system buttery smooth. The lower screen resolution sure helped here, but we also think that HTC has spent some time streamlining Sense.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini uses the Snapdragon 400 chipset which has grown in popularity lately. It has two Krait 300 cores clocked lower than usual at 1.4GHz and Adreno 305, along with 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Krait 300 should perform okay even at 1.4GHz against the Krait 200 cores at 1.5GHz as some older phones have. We wish the clock speed was at 1.7GHz like it is in most dual- and quad-core versions of Krait 300, but still. What we're really concerned about is the limited amount of RAM, but synthetic benchmarks don't really show how RAM capacity affects usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-core performance is on the level of the Snapdragon S4 Pro-powered ex-flagships. Multithreaded performance is more of a mixed bag, beating quad-core Cortex-A9 phones in Linpack but lagging behind them in Geekbench 2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall performance is in a similar situation - AnTuTu puts the HTC One mini at the bottom, while Quadrant pushes it above last year's flagships, but still near the bottom when new phones are considered.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark was run at 1080p offscreen mode to measure raw GPU performance, which seems to be above what Tegra 3 managed last year and close to the Mali-400 of the same generation. Still, comparing it to the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (which uses the same chipset) shows the GPU was downclocked too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the HTC One mini has a 720p screen, Epic Citadel shows more realistic numbers. The Galaxy Mega 6.3 has a dual-core Krait 300 at 1.7GHz and Adreno 305 with a 720p screen (unlike the qHD screen of the Galaxy S4 mini) but the Epic Citadel framerate is basically even, so the difference in clockspeed doesn't translate into a huge real-world performance (not yet any way, heavier games will change that).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Adreno 305 supports OpenGL ES 3.0, which was recently added to Android (with 4.3) and that promised improved graphics, so there's room for improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>JavaScript performance of the HTC One mini browser is close enough to that of the HTC One, that it nearly doesn't matter (JS doesn't care for multi-core CPUs much). However, BrowserMark 2 and Vellamo show scores that can compete with the current flagships (the One mini has to render pages at 720p, less than half the pixels of a 1080p screen).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned that none of these benchmarks really measure the effects of the relatively low amount of available RAM. That's because you only notice it when running multiple apps and switching between them. That said, the One mini performed okay most of the time - it's not as snappy as its daddy, but there are no annoying slowdowns as far as we could tell in the limited time we had with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As an integral part of Android Jelly Bean Google Now is available on the HTC One. You can launch it by holding the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will serve information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to Google Now and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this in the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Google Now widget which generates information for you based on what your interests are. You can put it on the lockscreen for at-a-glance info.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People app in Sense 5 has seen some minor changes too. Instead of clickable tabs at the bottom of the screen you get side-scrollable tabs on the top, which is a more convenient solution (and along the lines of stock Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well by tapping the ellipsis button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and finally the "Gallery" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook. These tabs can be hidden and rearranged too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more. If a contact is linked with a Facebook or other account you can see them either merged or choose to view either profile. In fact, the phone will automatically suggest to do that when it thinks two entries are for the same person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is Block contact - the One mini will block all calls, texts and other messages from that contact. You can add any number too, which is great if you get spam messages from an automatic number. You can later check the call and message history from those contacts and get them out of the dog house if you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony works like a charm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini did great in our signal test, providing great reception in environments where others dropped calls. The volume in the earpiece was extremely loud (we almost never used it at full volume) while clarity wasn't an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC One mini displays your recent calls with the usual tabs above, accessible via side-swipes. There's smart dialing on the One mini - once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number. You can even switch to a QWERTY keyboard instead of the phone keypad. Another nice feature is the button that unveils all the contact info and lets you do just about anything - send an email, assign a custom ringtone and so on. It's a handy way to find and do something with the right contact, not just for dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problem we have with the smart dial is that it only suggests one contact at a time - if you want another one (e.g. both Dexter and Dee Dee match "de" or "33"), you have to keep typing until you find the right one, you can't just pick out of a list of 3-4 matching contacts as on most other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is voice dialing, you hit the button, wait a couple of seconds for the One mini to get ready and say "Call Dexter". This is a little too slow for our liking though (the phone says "Just one moment", pauses, "Say a command when you're ready" and then you can talk).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini doesn't support video calling over the cellular network by default. The good news is there are a bunch of apps which could fill in the blank spot with video calling over Wi-Fi and 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, Quiet ring on pickup will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus of BoomSound speakers is not absolute loudness but quality of the sound. The HTC One mini scored a Good mark with results very similar to that of the regular HTC One, so HTC didn't skimp on the speakers. While the One mini is not the easiest phone to hear, it's one of the most pleasant to listen to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can read more about the loudspeaker tests here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging well set<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC One mini are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's Hangouts, which can connect you to Google's chat network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or half in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is pretty nice. Keys are well spaced but the overlay doesn't include any gaps between them, which is only a cosmetic feature and poses no discomfort. The 4.3" diagonal offers enough space for comfortable typing. Some keys can be long pressed to get additional symbols, which speeds up typing in some cases as you don't have to keep going back to the symbols section of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa. You can also enable arrow keys, which show up below the portrait keyboard (but not the landscape one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Prediction is available, even prediction for the next word you're about to type. When the phone has learned from you, it can get pretty good at guessing and saving you whole words. You can edit a personal dictionary of words and backup and restore it either to local storage or to an email account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has included the Trace keyboard, which acts like Swipe. You drag a finger over the desired keys and the phone predicts what you're trying to write. It works really well but language support is limited. Voice transcription is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the built-in HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color-coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs like many other Sense 5 apps. You can choose the Filters setting and show/hide the ones you want or rearrange the visible ones. You can choose from All, Favorites, Unread and Attached (hidden by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC One lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Zoe is a wiz at photo retouching<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Zoe is more advanced than any other gallery on a phone and it was made possible by the dedicated ImageChip 2. When you use the camera in Zoe mode, every time you press the shutter key, the phone captures up to 20 full res shots and a 3 second video (1 second before you press the shutter key and 2 seconds after). All that information is required for the advanced features of Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of those features is Events. Zoe can be used as a regular image gallery with photos stacked together by folders, but Events groups photos by when and where they were taken. Each event has a 30 second highlight video, which is stitched together from those 3 second clips plus a slideshow, including some of the pics. You can remove clips and add new ones to the highlight video, add a video effect and also include a background music (the tracks are preset, though it is possible to add new ones to the list).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The animation in the Gallery is seamless, which is more than we can say about it outside the HTC One mini. If you save the pictures on your PC you're left with 20 shots for every Zoe animation created. The good news is HTC allows you to upload the sequences to their Zoeshare webpage and send the links to your friends. Images there are displayed like GIFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos and multiple full-res shots come into play when editing images as well. Since the phone has a video of the scene during which the photo was taken, it can find moving objects and put a red X on them so that you can tap and remove the ones you want, but keep the rest. The result is a full-resolution 4MP image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe can also make sure everyone in the photo is smiling and their eyes are open - it detects all faces and circles them, then you can swipe to go through all available images of that face until you find the perfect one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another feature is called Sequence shot. It takes a shot of a moving object and it creates a cool "multiple exposure" effect where that object appears several times on the photo. It's perhaps easier to show the effect than explain it, here's a shot of a BMXer jumping over a ramp. You can tweak the effect by adding and removing clones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe's arsenal of effects doesn't end here - there are some vanity effects too. One such effect is Face contour, which allows you to easily slim someone's face. There's also Skin smoothing, an automatic lighting fix, Eye enhancer (which makes your subject's eyes open wider), Eye brightening, Red-eye removal and Anti-shine. The intensity of these effects is adjustable with a slider so you can fine tune it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's just the Retouch section of the Photo Editor. There are also effects, frames and transformations available. Basically, Zoe is nearly as potent as Photoshop in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you are not limited to that site - you can share these albums on other social networks just as easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, you can find a map with your geotagged images in the Gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player with very limited codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Video player on the HTC One mini has a pretty simple interface. There isn't even a dedicated app, you just pick a video from the gallery. Anyway, you get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to launch the camera and a small square with the current time and battery charge. Those automatically hide after a few seconds, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player can use the Beats audio sound enhancement just like the music player, which is great for watching videos. The video player supports DLNA and subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Previously the video player had an option to play 60fps videos at 30fps for a slow-motion effect, but that has been removed (we checked the big HTC One, the option is missing there too after the update to 4.2).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini failed pretty miserably when it came to codec support. It couldn't play all most DivX videos (we even had an issue of an AVI video with MP3 audio playing without sound), XviDs refused to play, MOV files were out of the question and it did choke with some audio codecs (like AC3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos that played did so up to 1080p, including MKV files. With a display like that the HTC One mini is some proper codec support away from becoming a powerful tool for watching video on the go. Luckily there are a few dozen video players in the Play Store to address that deficiency and some of them are even free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Beats<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini comes with a custom music player, which is HTC Beats enabled, of course. It can organize your music library by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders (we don't see this option very often). The phone will also easily stream songs over DLNA, you're not limited to the music library you have in the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has some handy features out of the box. It can automatically look for and download Album art and artist photos (you can limit it to Wi-Fi connections only) and it can also search for lyrics. The lyrics can be displayed either in karaoke mode or just as text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no equalizer on board, you just have the option to toggle Beats audio on or off. That's not ideal, but at least the BoomSound stereo speakers on the front of the HTC One mini are quite loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and it has even been integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio and TuneIn Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the headphones or loudspeaker choice you also get Mono sound if the reception is poor. There's no Beats enhancement here, however, nor is there a playback control card on the lockscreen. The SoundHound shortcut will find out the name of the currently playing song for you and will offer to take you to a digital music store where you can buy it or lookup the song's lyrics or watch the video on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go with TuneIn Radio, which relies on your internet connection and can play just about every station on the planet that's gone broadband (most of them have). And the audio quality is even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set stations as favorites, search local stations by country or genre, and the app will even list you results to specific artist, album or song searches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can also set your alarm to wake you up with your favorite station. Keep in mind that you need an active connection for this and it does tend to take the life out of your battery fast in the morning.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Spotless audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini audio output is almost identical to that of its full-sized sibling and everyone who has heard that one play will tell that there's no greater compliment you can pay to a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One mini did great in the active external amplifier part of the test, posting great scores all over the field. In addition it had volume levels higher than just about any smartphone outside the Beats family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More impressively, there's next to no degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk rises a tiny bit, but that's the only affected reading. Volume levels remain at the same high level, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>UltraPixel camera without OIS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini uses the 4MP UltraPixel sensor, which is about the size of most smartphone camera sensors (1/3") but uses much bigger pixels (which is also why the resolution is limited to 4MP). On the up side, bigger pixels have better performance in poor lighting conditions. The fast F/2.0 lens, which also helps low-light shooting, but there's no optical image stabilization (OIS) like on the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor has a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is perfect for viewing on the phone, on most tablets (which typically have 16:10 screens) and HDTVs. 4:3 photos would either get black bars or get cropped on these screens, which does help close the resolution gap somewhat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface itself is pretty simple - there are two shutter keys (one for stills and one for video), above them is the gallery shortcut and below is the effects button. On the left side of the screen you get flash mode selector and the Zoe toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, we already covered what Zoe does after you've taken a shot, here's how the actual shooting goes. You enable Zoe (an indicator at the bottom of the screen confirms you're in Zoe mode) and tap the still shutter key. The key turns into a progress bar, counting down the three seconds during which the phone records video, reminding you to stay relatively still.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini camera produces good images, but despite using big "UltraPixels" and shooting in broad daylight, the images had noticeable (at 100% zoom) noise. The low resolution also means that the smallest fine detail is lost. There are oversharpening halos and some purple fringing too, but at least the color reproduction is good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewed at 1080p resolution, the photos look pretty good, but there's very little room for cropping at this low resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the same samples taken with the HTC One. You'll notice a difference in white balance, the HTC One mini images are colder (oddly, its screen is warmer than the HTC One screen, so when viewed on the two phones the photos look pretty much the same). Other than that, the images look basically the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that in some shots the two phones chose different focus. For each sample, we held the two phones in the exact same place with the focus point left at the center (the default). We took several samples of each location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were curious just how much of a difference OIS makes, so we put the HTC One mini against the big One to find out. We also tested the difference in video recording in the next chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first samples are taken in a dark room with the flash disabled. Both phones dropped the shutter speed to 1/10s and boosted the ISO to 1000 and the HTC One managed a slightly better shot, but the lack of OIS didn't seem to hurt the One mini too badly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the next samples, we took a step back and enabled the flash. The One had a few out of focus shots more than the mini, but other than that the photos once again looked mostly the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini has HDR support for both its still image and videos. In stills, HDR mode gives shadows a good boost, but it tends to wash out the highlights. At least the effect isn't as exaggerated as on the HTC One. Note that HDR photos do have some extra smearing as the phone has to align and compose a couple of different exposures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried out the panorama mode. Both phones did about the same with almost no stitching artifacts (assuming there are no moving objects).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we did notice is the vertical resolution - the HTC One managed about 200px more than the One mini. Now, both shoot at the same vertical resolution but have to crop a bit from the top and the bottom as our hands bob up and down slightly. We guess the One's OIS managed to dampen those enough to score the extra resolution, but neither is particularly impressive at about 9MP total resolution.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini has the same camera as the big HTC One, sans the stabilization. You can see how the two stack up and how they compare to other cameras using our tool's downscale option. Remember that 1080p is just over 2MP.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video camera with HDR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini can shoot videos at up to 1080p resolution at 30fps. It has an HDR option for the video, but note that the frame rate falls to 28fps, if you enable it and the field of view gets narrower in this mode. It also supports 720p @ 60fps high framerate video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features continuous autofocus and you have the option to lock the focus during video recording, if it hunts too much in dynamic scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 files with an impressive 20Mbps bitrate - among the highest we've seen. Sound is captured in stereo with 192Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate. Framerate wasn't a solid 30fps, but sometimes would dip to 28fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, videos are okay in terms of fine detail, but not spectacular. Colors are slightly off (oversaturated), but not as much as most other phones produce.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a FullHD video sample captured with the One mini we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 1080p sample (0:06s, 15.1MB) taken straight off the HTC One mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also watch a video shot with the bit HTC One a minute after the video above:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the promised Optical Image Stabilization test. We start off trying to hold the phones as steady as we can and then shook them harder. The lack of OIS is pretty noticeable - even when we were trying to hold the One mini steady, the footage came out shaky. With stronger shaking the One mini develops a pretty bad rolling shutter, while the HTC One looks better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR videos capture more detail in the highlights, but don't do much for the shadows. The white balance is off (videos have a purple tint) and the colors are duller. Combined with the narrower FoV, we'd only enable HDR for videos as a last resort when shooting against the sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind, however, that the field of view gets significantly narrower during HDR video capture, which means you'll be able to fit much less into the frame than you normally would. Note that 720p mode also has a narrower FoV, nearly the same as the 1080p HDR mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 60 frames per second mode on the HTC One mini but it reduces the maximum resolution to 720p. This doesn't sound too bad, but the actual output is pretty bad. There's very little detail and even though the clips are really smooth, we'd advise you to stay away from this mode. Oddly, we found that the 720p @ 60fps mode has the widest FoV, wider than even 1080p with HDR off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've added the HTC One mini to our video quality comparison tool. Here it really managed to show what it's capable of. It's really good in low-light video, better than most competitors, but the bigger HTC One somehow manages to capture more detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity misses a few things compared to the One<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini has the usual quad-band GSM, plus several versions (for different regions or carriers) of 3G HSPA+ and market-dependent 4G LTE support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and stereo Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the One mini with a PC. The long list of options includes Portable Wi-Fi hotspot, settings, USB and Bluetooth tethering (the phone becomes a modem).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Portable Hotspot can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini lacks a few connectivity options compared to the big HTC One - NFC, MHL and IR. No NFC means you can't easily send data to another phone (by a simple tap rather than the usual search and pair methods). No MHL means you can't connect the phone to a TV or attach USB storage. The IR blaster was used to control TVs and other home equipment (not to transfer data like in the old days).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are not necessarily deal breakers, but those are compromises you should be aware of before committing to the One mini.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser with Flash and GIFs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One comes with the latest version of the Sensed-out Android web browser. Most of its UI is out of sight, leaving the entire screen to the web page. And even when it does appear it consists of a single bar, which now holds the address field, the Tabs and Menu dropdown shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking. Pages can be reflowed to better fit the screen and you can set things like default zoom, search engine and URL suggestion providers and so on. From the Labs setting you can enable Quick controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner - they can't be swiped off the screen like you do in the app switcher. Incognito tabs are available if you want to browse without leaving traces. There's a popup blocker to stave off annoying popups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another cool feature is preloading search results that the phone believes are relevant, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini comes with full Flash support in the browser (it's disabled by default). We tested a couple of games and videos and everything worked like a charm. Flash has almost been weeded out of the mobile web, but there are still a few stubborn sites, so it's good to have as backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, while digging through the settings menu of the browser, we found that there's an explicit setting for GIF animations, which is disabled by default. GIF on Android has a spotty history, but keep in mind the One mini browser support animations, as long as you enable them first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Chrome browser also comes preinstalled on the HTC One mini. Its interface is easier to navigate but it doesn't offer Flash support. On the up side, it can synchronize the tabs you have open in other Chrome browsers (on a computer, tablet, other phone, you name it).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full Office suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Organizing is dully covered on the HTC One mini. Office documents are handled through the preloaded Polaris Office app. It supports Excel, Word, PowerPoint and more and lets you view and edit files on the go. It's great to see a full Office suite when even some flagships (*cough*Galaxy S4*cough*) don't have one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested a couple of Word and Excel files and found the One perfectly capable of handling them. There's a PDF viewer too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC even added a VPN app, KeyVPN, which you might need for your work, so it's great to have out of the box (and for free).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar on the HTC One mini has five different types of view: Month, Week, Day, Agenda and Invites. You can swipe between different months/weeks/days like you would through tabs in other Sense 5 apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder. Naturally, the Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), only one of which you can sync with your computer. You can also easily show/hide the ones you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invites view only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator on board. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app comes with World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch and a Timer. The World clock is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and zoom in on it freely. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock application can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The stopwatch and timer are pretty self explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tasks app is here as well. It does exactly what the name suggests and can access your Google Tasks. There is no location-based reminder support unlike with Any.DO, iOS's Reminders, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Note app is also onboard. It is somewhat similar to Samsung's SPen - you can take various notes, add drawings, pictures and dictations. Sharing and printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Weather app is here too. It became popular years ago with its cool weather animations and widget. You can preset many cities across the globe and it uses the AccuWeather info (much like Samsung and Apple do).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has all the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini is one of the very few phones trying to fill the gap of compact high-end phones. And it comes within walking distance of being the super mini, but it doesn't really go the whole way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start off with what we like. The build of the phone is amazing, easily rivaling current flagships (heck, it even beats quite a few). The screen is beautiful and the BoomSound speakers around it are well appreciated too. Software-wise the One mini is in lockstep with the regular HTC One, another plus. Then there's the LTE connectivity, which is becoming more important as new 4G LTE networks launch across the globe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But why isn't it available in 32GB flavor? 12 gigs of user available storage will make you feel uncomfortably cramped with 3D games and music and movies quickly piling up, not to mention those Zoe shots or even plain 1080p videos. And going with a lower bin chipset with just 1GB RAM can cause headaches a year from now - those are early 2012 specs. And when you take out the Optical Image Stabilization, that 4MP camera does rather poorly. Some might miss, like NFC, the IR blaster or MHL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All those issues can be easily resolved by getting the HTC One instead, but the One mini has more compact phones to worry about, not gigantic flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The obvious arch enemy is the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini. It's winning quite a lot of the important battles - it's more compact, it's cheaper, it's got a faster chipset, expandable storage, IR and NFC, heck, it even has a dual-SIM version in certain regions. But the Samsung handset loses is perhaps the most important one - a qHD screen isn't bad, but it's certainly not worthy of anything carrying the S4 label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy plastic exterior is also not doing the S4 mini any favors when compared to what is certainly one of the prettiest smartphones in the market in the face of One mini. Finally, there's the audio experience, which is another round that goes the way of the HTC handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9190 Galaxy S4 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also have the Motorola DROID Mini with a 4.3" 720p Super AMOLED, a more capable Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset, bigger battery and Kevlar back (with a clear coat on top). And it has a 10MP ClearPixel camera that seems to have an edge on the non-OIS UltraPixel camera of the One mini in terms of low-light performance without sacrificing daylight performance. This one is a Verizon exclusive, though, so it can't really complete successfully with the global HTC One mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola DROID Mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia V is from last year and has an impressive back then 4.3" 720p screen. It's a bit behind on Android versions, but it does pack a 13MP camera. And while it's not made of metal, it does have an IP57 certification, meaning you can take it with you in the pool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia V</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or how about a change of OS? The HTC 8X has a colorful polycarbonate charm and it is in the same boat in terms of storage - 16GB, no microSD card. But at its price, it's a steal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What about a BlackBerry Z10? It certainly isn't perfect, but it's got a fresh-looking interface, solid quality and BlackBerry wold die to make this one a success so proper software support is to be easily expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Windows Phone 8X ? BlackBerry Z10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that all these phones are cheaper than the HTC One mini, often considerably cheaper. So, does the aluminum keep its luster when you have to squint when you see the price? We are sure for some it does and the rest can just wait a few weeks as the One mini price is bound to fall to more reasonable levels. Or you can simply go the carrier subsidy way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What worries us more is the lack of any future-proofing. What will happen in a year - HTC software updates credibility already took a big hit when they called off the One S update to Jelly Bean 4.2.x/Sense 5. We can't help but wonder how many Android updates will the very similarly spec'd the One mini will have?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're sick of all-plastic phones and you are a sucker for premium feeling handsets with great screens (there's a great shortage of those in the mid-range), that probably won't stop you from getting the HTC One mini, though.</paragraph>
