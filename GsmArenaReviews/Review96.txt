			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like every maker out there, Samsung are keen to keep users coming back for more. But serving, inspiring and entertaining today's crowd is not enough it seems. So the next step is raising future Samsung users. The S3650 Corby is tech-savvy and fresh - just like its target audience. And this entry level touchscreen seems to quite nicely suit both the user's liking and bill-payer's budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S3650 Corby is for youngsters that are keen on technology, for active social networkers, for those who like to personalize and customize. The budget price implies no fancy stuff but the wide range of features is absolutely relevant to the target audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S3650 Corby is a very fresh looking handset too - distinct shape and bold paintjobs. It won't really make much sense in adult hands but the Fashion Jackets - bright-colored interchangeable rear covers - are perhaps as strong a selling point as the capacitive touchscreen. There're two extra Jackets in the retail box to make the time spent with the S3650 Corby even more personal experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the social side, the Samsung S3650 Corby offers Facebook, MySpace and Twitter integration, while photo and video sharing are taken care of with direct uploads to YouTube, Flickr, Picasa and Photobucket. You can update your status on the various social networking sites and receive updates from your friends via a neat pop-up notification feature. All that is a tap away on the 2.8" capacitive touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Budget and low end can be easily mixed up with the Corby. But along with the features mentioned above, the basic handset has a lot of the technology used in the more expensive Samsung Jet. The S3650 Corby supports the same finger zoom feature, it has smart unlock and runs the widget-based TouchWiz user interface - not to mention the nice Samsung's home-brew web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S3650 Corby is by no means different than the latest crop of low and midrange Samsung touchscreens but its distinct styling and targeting sure make it worth a peek. Hit the jump for more cool photos and a 3D spin. We then proceed with handling and ergonomics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S3650 Corby 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Samsung S3650 Corby measures 103 x 56.5 x 12 mm and weighs 92 grams. It looks even slimmer than its 12 mm girth because of the distinct diagonal contour.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The plastic construction of the S3650 Corby certainly helps it keep its weight down to a svelte 92 grams. The entire surface is glossy and this definitely does not help you get rid of fingerprints. We've played around with the phone for a while to find it is quite resistant to scratches in defiance of it sleek front. Ergonomically it's very good and the oval shaped back panel makes gripping it easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.8" display takes centerstage on the S3650 front. It has a 240 x 320 pixel resolution, just like most previous generation touchscreens by Samsung. Its image quality isn't as impressive as that on high-end Samsungs with capacitive displays, but it isn't too bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the S3650 Corby touchscreen uses the capacitive technology, which requires only a touch rather than a push to register a click. Even the lightest of touches does the trick which is probably a large part of the reason why people buy touchscreen phones in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is well below the iPhone or Nokia standards, the narrow viewing angle the biggest disadvantage. Indoors the screen is quite good though, as one would expect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there's just the earpiece - there's no ambient light sensor to adjust the brightness of the display. Below the screen there are three hardware keys - two receiver keys on each side of the Back button. The Call and End keys are integrated into the body of the phone and have a distinct and audible click when pressed. Right under the back key is the tiny mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S3650 Corby's right-hand side houses just two controls - the shutter button and the HOLD key, which is used to lock and unlock the touchscreen. They are barely separated, which doesn't provide the best touch orientation. On that same side, only hidden under the battery cover, is the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lanyard eyelet is on the top left side, followed by the volume rocker in the middle and the proprietary connectivity port beneath for plugging in a charger, data cable and headset. We would have preferred a more standard connector here like microUSB. Traditionally for Samsung, the USB slot is covered with a plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom parts are absolutely bare, save for a tiny slit for removing the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smooth rear cover houses only the camera lens at one end and the loudspeaker grill at the other. Samsung call the back panel a Fashion Jacket, and will offer a number of exchangeable panels for the phone. Two of them will ship with the handset to spice things up a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those Corbies that we have here are merely the basic color versions. The available additional Fashion Jackets change the styling dramatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 960 mAh Li-Ion battery. There is no official word up to now on standby and talk times, but our pre-release unit lasted a good 3-4 days of moderate use. The only thing under the battery is the SIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the Samsung S3650 Corby is a pleasingly compact touchscreen phone. It's not the slimmest around, but the ergonomic design more than makes up for that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The smallest TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lively, colorful and pleasantly thumbable - the TouchWiz interface feels right at home in this entry level touchscreen, in which fun and ease of use are key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S3650 Corby offers three different homescreen panes that you can alternate by sideways sweeps. The current selection is indicated by three small dots at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can fill up each of those homescreens with as many widgets as you like. The different wallpapers are actually three parts of a single panoramic desktop, just like on the Samsung S8000 Jet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case some of you have missed it, widgets are nifty mini-apps that reside on your home screen. Some of them seem to have more purpose, such as the calendar and world clock, image gallery or the mp3/radio players, while others range from fun to pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, all the widgets are stored in a tray running down the side of the screen, which you can pull in and out as needed using the small arrow in the lower left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick which widgets to display by simply dragging them onto the display and placing them where you want. If any need to be removed, you simply drag them back to the tray. The nice accelerometer-based option to auto-align widgets by shaking the handset is at your disposal too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen and the new icon graphics aside, the rest of the S3650 Corby interface is typical Samsung (or at least the latest revision seen on the Samsung Jet). You have a tab at the bottom of the display which holds the three contextual keys with varying functionality based on the currently active menu. There are also some nice animations and transition effects throughout the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a 3 x 4 grid of icons, while sub-menus appear as lists. The main menu itself, as on the Samsung S8000 Jet, now stretches over three different screens and is sweep-scrollable sideways. The reason that so much more space was needed is the fact that almost all apps are now brought to the main menu, arranged in a flat iPhone-like structure. You will only need to dig deeper for the settings but if those were also brought to the fore, the main menu would most certainly have become a huge mess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3650 Corby also supports multitasking, which means that Java applications can be minimized to run in the background. However, there is no hardware key to allow you to switch between the apps, which certainly makes multitasking much less of a treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also enabled the S3650 Corby with the Smart unlock feature, previously known as Gesture lock. Smart unlock allows users to simultaneously unlock the phone and open a menu item, application - even dial a contact - just by drawing a letter on the unlock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each letter from A to Z can be set as a gesture by the user to perform the various actions in question. For instance, you can use it to start apps like the music player, messaging menu, the web browser, Java apps or the dialing keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S3650 Corby sports a brand new cute little theme designed especially for this handset's young audience. We guess it's part of the whole dynamic Cartoon UI thing that was much advertised by Samsung. In our pre-market sample though there was no trace of a context-dependent wallpaper or any dynamic changes. The theme itself is quite alright, with neatly drawn icons and hand-writing font in the list menus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A standard phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung S3650 Corby has it all. Up to 2000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. It can display the names from the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different detail fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 4 email addresses, URLs and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture, as well as a note. You can even set a video as "caller's image".</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Some nice telephony features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3650 Corby is excellent at its main job - making calls - we experienced no reception or voice quality drops for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to say about the dialer. You dial just like you would on any touch phone. There are three virtual buttons - phonebook, more and back. When you type a number or look it up in the contact list, by tapping More you can access options like voice call, send message or add to phonebook. Of course you have the hardware call buttons too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the handset has no smart dialing, which could have saved the users some digging in the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the dialer itself is not very interesting, there's a flashier way to dial. The Photo Contacts are shown as a stack of pictures. Tapping on a photo brings up a menu with options to start a voice call or send a message. The Photo Contacts are changed since the last implementation of the TouchWiz UI in the Jet and they now automatically store picture links to the most used contacts. The option to tag people's faces is no longer available. The feature makes more sense now as it's fully automatic and as long as you have assigned images to your contacts, you'll be alright.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for loudspeaker performance, the S3650 Corby scored a very good mark. Here it is alongside some of the other devices we have tested. You can find more details about the test itself as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might expect, the Samsung S3650 handles all common message types. The handset has a shared editor for SMS and MMS and a separate one for emails. A rich T9 dictionary is at the user's disposal too. There is no landscape QWERTY keyboard available here, perhaps due to the small screen size. Still we would have preferred it if users had that choice for themselves to make.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a native email client. It failed to retrieve Gmail settings automatically so we had to enter them manually, but once that's done, emailing is a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The attachment limit for sending is 5MB, which is enough for most file types. If you receive an office document as an attachment, you will be able to view it as well thanks to the integrated office document viewer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking on the go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As promised by the manufacturer, the S3650 Corby comes with social integration disguised under three neat homescreen widgets - MySpace, Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three widgets have similar interface - a big update button at the top, a text field for your current mood/status message and some buttons the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the MySpace widget the available options include checking your messages, getting into chat and adding friends. The Facebook widget offers again checking your messages, adding new friends and its last option is poking a friend. Finally the Twitter widget has only two virtual keys - friends and followers. The Settings button is available everywhere offering options for auto-refresh and adding a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see, the widgets aren't exactly full of features, but the basics seem covered. They are more than enough to keep you connected to your social circle on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social networking integration stretches even further to having a dedicated item in the main menu. The Communities item gets you links to websites such as Facebook, Picasa and Flickr and the ability to directly upload files. You can also preset your login details so you don't have to enter them each time you access those websites or try to upload content from the file manager - the S3650 Corby stores your credentials for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That pretty much covers what Samsung have been doing in the social networking department. Unfortunately, there's no phonebook integration such as the one offered by HTC Sense UI on the HTC Hero and HTC HD2 or the MotoBLUR UI on the Motorola Milestone/Droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter how limited, the controls available on the Samsung Corby allow you to chat, update your status, post tweets, upload photos and read your friends' new posts. Despite the lack of 3G, all these are barely traffic-intensive, so you won't miss HSDPA speeds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fast file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S3650 Corby's file browser can display the files and folders from the phone memory or the memory card, and even both at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for different types of files (images, video, sounds) to let the handset sort the memory contents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, you are not forced to follow this structure - you can place your files wherever you want and the phone will have no problems handling them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (except the predefined folders, like Images, Sounds and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth, one by one again, or in bulk. Throughout the whole file manager you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading from the memory card is quick and won't bother users at all. Listing the thumbnails of pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card is quite fast too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The initiatialization speed of the memory card is surprisingly fast: regardless of the capacity, the S3650 Corby recognizes a memory card in 10-15 seconds. The phone comfortably handles a 16GB microSD card full of thousands of different files. Working with the files on the memory card once it's initialized is fast enough to satisfy most users; however, speed does drop when the card starts filling up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is basic, but gets the job done<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike recent Samsung devices like the S8300 UltraTOUCH, the S3650 Corby has only one picture gallery. However, that can't be considered an issue since the gallery it does have is fully functional. You'll most likely not miss the Photo browser despite its eye-catching qualities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S3650 Corby gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and launching it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep your fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list. Browsing the images is really fast and responsive with no lag thanks to the capacitive screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in is easy enough though not as responsive as we would have like it. You have the one-finger zooming but it kicks in after you spend some considerable amount of time (like 3 sec) touching the image with your thumb. From there on it's just a matter of dragging your finger up for zooming in and down for zooming out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a second zoom control which is more conventional - a zoom bar with thumbable loupe icons that allows you to actually zoom with tapping instead of dragging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing images in landscape mode is also available. As there's no accelerometer for automatic rotation, you can can switch to landscape view via t the dedicated toggle on screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Samsung S3650 is exactly the same as in the Jet and Star and hasn't been altered much from the M8800 Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also has a dedicated homescreen widget, allowing quick access to the full version of the application with only a single tap. You can also start, stop and alternate tracks straight from the home screen if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The equalizer offers the standard presets like pop, jazz, classic, etc. but it also packs three additional options - widening, dynamic and surround effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but certainly not least, the player is nicely touch-optimized to include fast forward and rewind, just like on the S5600. This adds up to an excellent music application that can fully replace your portable MP3 player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3650 Corby features an FM radio with RDS. The S3650 Corby's radio app offers intuitive controls and has the Find Music recognition service implemented, which works much like Sony Ericsson's TrackID.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio app is in the Applications menu but the Radio widget on the home screen gives you more immediate access. Tapping on it brings up the radio or you could just use the widget's controls to start/stop the radio or change the station. It can only skip between saved stations though, and if you want to search you'll have to do it in the actual app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of stations, you can save stations but they are labeled just by their frequency and you can't rename them. There's a separate list for your favorite stations though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a simple interface with not too many features. All the basic are covered though, and that should really be enough as the screen size doesn't really lend itself to watching whole movies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports MP4 videos but we only managed to get QVGA samples running. VGA resolution videos we tried were a no go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality going back to the right track<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio output of the Samsung S3650 Corby is pretty pleasing, save for one minor flaw. The stereo crosstalk reading in our traditional test came up pretty poor, suggesting some leakage between the two channels. However since this is purely a mechanical problem we are suspecting that it is mainly due to the pre-release status of our unit and it might as well be taken care of in the final version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level and dynamic range readings on the other hand are excellent even at this stage. The distortion levels are also kept well under control and the frequency response is pretty good. In case you are wondering about the big deviation numbers that goes in that column in the table - it's mainly due to the extreme low-frequency sounds which have been cut off, but the line goes pretty near to perfect in the rest of the range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the table and the graph so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>2 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3650 Corby features a 2 megapixel fixed focus camera for maximum image resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera does not have auto-focus, but it sports the nice Smile shot feature. Basically when it's on, pushing the camera button doesn't immediately result in taking the picture. Instead, the camera just starts tracking the framed face. As soon as the person smiles, the handset takes the shot for you automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized and is certainly among the most comfortable camera interfaces on a touchscreen device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is not some spectacular performer, but it's quite alright for a 2 megapixel snapper. The iPhone 3G can hardly do any better, you know. Noise suppression is a bit too aggressive at times, eradicating all fine detail, but it seems passable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The worst part though is the lens problem resulting in annoying softness on the right half of every photo. We suppose this is a unit-specific issue and in reality things should be as good as the left half of the sample images. Plus, we have a pre-release sample on our hands here and Samsung engineers will surely improve things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording capabilities of the Samsung S3650 Corby are very poor - it maxes out at QVGA@15fps. Hardly any usable videos can be produced with those specs but the consolation is that the competing LG Cookie doesn't offer anything better either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample Samsung S3650 video recording for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3650 is usable worldwide with quad-band GSM support - even though Europe is its main market at this point. The handset omits 3G support so users are stuck with EDGE as there's no Wi-Fi on board either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least Bluetooth is enabled and comes with A2DP support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the majority of recent Samsung devices which sport a microUSB port, the S3650 Corby is (mis)treated to the company's older proprietary port. Hooking it up with a USB cable, allows you to set up the phone in mass storage mode or PC suite mode (or Media player) or to prompt each time it's paired with a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In mass storage mode, it gives access to the memory card but not to the internal memory and you cannot use the phone for calls or data while connected. Annoyingly, it would often be impossible to access the memory card on the S3650 for a couple of minutes after connecting in mass storage mode - but that again might be one of our pre-release mishaps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3650 Corby, like the Samsung S8000 Jet, features the new WebKit-based Dolfin web browser, which is a home-brew application. With full Flash support and the new one-finger zooming algorithm, it is one of the finest web browsers we have seen on a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one-finger zooming works like a charm too. Of course you can also rely on double tapping a block of text or an image and the handset will automatically zoom in to it. Another double tap and you are back to the previous zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to Flash and Java support, the new web browser also offers kinetic scrolling and fullscreen view. You can scroll by simply sweeping a finger across the screen. The actual scrolling is very choppy and is perhaps the only downside to browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As suggested, the full Flash support extends to include full featured YouTube videos as well. Given that EDGE is your only connectivity option, we guess however that using the light handheld version at m.youtube.com will be way more practical.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S3650 Corby has a number of useful time-management applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. You can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday. However, with the Samsung S3650 there is only a single type of event available in the calendar. You can set the starting date and time of the event and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm is quite customizable. You can set up to 10 alarms, each with the following configurable options - custom ringtone, volume, repetition days and name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator of the Samsung S3650 is very basic. Among the other organizer offerings are a voice recorder, a world time application and a unit converter. The voice recorder limit is set to 60 minutes. A countdown timer and a stopwatch also come in useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also to-do and memo applications for jotting down tasks and notes. You can also use the memo widget to place a memo on the homescreen where you're unlikely to forget it. The widget and the application are separate so don't expect your memos to automatically pop up on screen. Oh, and there's a to-do widget as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung S3650 comes with an office document viewer that supports Word, Excel, Powerpoint and PDF files. It's an application developed by Access and is one of the nicest additions to the software package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The document viewer is quick enough when opening files; however, panning is rather slow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Only trial games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical of Samsung recently, the S3650 Corby offers only a bunch of trial games - Asphalt 4, Brain Challenge, Diamond, Pyramid, Crazy Penguin Catapult and Monopoly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's nothing unique about the Samsung S3650 Corby but there's no way you can miss it. No, you won't be considering it, unless you're of a certain age, but you'll notice it and perhaps even appreciate it. Neatly repackaged to appeal to its intended audience, the S3650 Corby makes sense as an entry level offering. What's more - given its specific targeting - the phone seems capable of convincing those who'll be using it and those who'll be buying it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S3650 Corby is a simple, affordable and attractive touchscreen with modest but very focused feature set. It is designed to be small, to suit the social needs of youngsters and to be trendy. Its styling and Fashion Jackets are quite relevant too. Camera, MP3 player, capacitive touchscreen, neat user interface and distinct design are enough to seal the deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no shortage of basic touchscreens lately but the S3650 Corby's specific targeting makes it quite hard to pinpoint a direct competitor. An almost textbook example in this segment though is LG KP500 Cookie - pretty much the standard along with the Samsung Star for appeal, affordability, fun and ease of use. The Cookie has similar features and looks a bit more serious (as if teens and tweens care) and costs a bit less, now that it's been around for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KP500 Cookie</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking into the Samsung back catalogue you get the S3650 Corby's most likely prototype - the S5230 Star. With almost the same specs and price, but with different - more mainstream - design, bigger (resistive) touchscreen and a 3 megapixel camera, the Star is selling like hotcakes. The new Star is also keen to play along, sporting Wi-Fi and a duly upgraded price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung S5230 Star ? Samsung S5230W Star WiFi</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Talking of competitors, let's not forget one of the latest mid-range XpressMusic devices - the Nokia 5530 XpressMusic. Its price tag is heftier (30 euro more) but the extra cash gets you Symbian OS, Wi-Fi support, a 3-megapixel autofocus shooter and solid music pedigree. And of course, if you prefer, you can surely get the Wi-Fi-less version that comes with GPS - the Nokia 5230.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 5530 XpressMusic ? Nokia 5230</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Spending a week with the S3650 Corby we found ourselves liking it very much. It's pretty hard to imagine though it will ever outgrow its niche. A phone for tweens and teens, the S3650 Corby will hardly repeat the sales of the Star. But if it finds its intended audience it will probably do quite well for Samsung in the long run. Giving a tween a S3650 Corby may not make them a future geek. But a loyal user will suit Samsung just fine.</paragraph>
