			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You might be amazed to learn that this year?s edition of the IFA consumer electronics show has not even begun yet. Yup, we?re serious. Officially, the expo opens doors to the public tomorrow, on Friday, September 6. All the announcements, press conferences and product demos you enjoyed so far on our home page are open exclusively to journalists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Berlin Messe is where the annual IFA expo traditionally takes place and this is our workplace this week. We are hard at work bringing you the latest that happens around these parts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already seen all the new stuff that the major smartphone brands had brought to the IFA floor and now it?s time to turn our attention to what lesser known brands have to show. These are products of various caliber, which are equally interesting, but somehow pushed out of the spotlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the following pages you'll find our hands-on experience with devices by several smartphone/tablet/computer makers. There goes the cheat sheet:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Panasonic 4K Toughpad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Panasonic 4K Toughpad. It's a proper x86 computer, running Windows 8, hidden in the body of a sleek tablet with a screen that spans 20 inches in diagonal. What's more, the said screen will bring tears in your eyes if you try and discern the individual pixels. The 20-inch screen on the Panasonic 4K Toughpad boasts the impressive 4K UHD resolution and this means no less than 3840 x 2160px.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It took Panasonic the better half of a year to give away more than just the basic details on the 4K Toughpad, which was originally shown at the beginning of the year at CES in Las Vegas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The "tablet" has a whopping 20" 10-finger multi-touch display of 4K resolution (3840 x 2560)which breaks down to the impressive 230 ppi. The display is an IPS unit and has the enviable 176-degree viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the surface of the 4K Toughpad is Windows 8.1 and an Intel Core i5 processor. There will be two versions of the 4K Toughpad - the first will weigh 2.3 kg and will carry 4 gigs of RAM and a 128GB SSD, while the heavier 2.7 kg model will have 8 gigs of RAM, which will be expandable to 16 GB, and a 256GB SSD. each of those models has three USB 3.0 ports along with an SD card slot and HDMI out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Panasonic 4K Toughpad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panasonic 4K Toughpad supports the Anoto Live Pen, to be used for drawing on the display, which has a special palm-rejecting feature and a built-in battery that's good for six hours on a charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a desktop cradle with a mounting port adapter, which coupled with a set of mouse and keyboard turn the Panasonic 4K Toughpad into a fully-functional touch-enabled All-in-One PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video of the 4K Toughpad in action at the IFA floor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panasonic 4K Toughpad is said to be reinforced against 2.5 ft (around 76 cm) drops but we wouldn't really want to test that spec out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The base model will cost ?4,508, while the 8 gig version is still to get a price tag. The optional pen will sell for ?280. According to Panasonic reps the standard 4K Toughpad will start shipping in November with the performance model coming later in early 2014.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, before you get your hopes too high, there's a chance that the 4K Toughpad won't see wide retail availability, being reserved instead for big companies through direct B2B orders - we'll need to wait and see.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite its monstrous (in tablet terms) size, the 4K Toughpad feels rather light. The bezels around the screen are thin, although we don't really see this as a benefit as nobody will be comfortable using this device hand-held.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen, as you can imagine, is a pleasure to look at. It's actually incredible even up close. The super high 4K Ultra HD resolution at this relatively modest size (you are more likely to see it on 60-inch+ screens) really stands out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the first touch it's immediately noticeable that the Panasonic 4K Toughpad was made with attention to detail. The materials used feel premium and the color patterns are interesting both at the front and especially at the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4K Toughpad has a glossy finish, which isn't ideal but seeing as this is a device that will spend most of its time lying flat or on its stand we don't see it as a problem. The array of ports is also great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panasonic 4K Toughpad is a great concept, even if it needs a dedicated kickstand to stand firm on a desk. The screen is incredible and even if you're not planning on using it as a work horse for 3D modelling or drawing professionally it's still great for up-close multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However at this price it's a little insane to go for it for this purpose alone. For the same price you can find a suitable, bigger, screen to enjoy multimedia on. The only reason to go for the 4K Toughpad is the pen input for dedicated artists and graphics professionals.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe X hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo brought the Vibe X - an Android 4.2 phone with a slim, 6.9mm body. That's the same thickness as Lenovo's bigger K900 and while it's not the thinnest we've handled, it still pretty impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It felt quite light too, we wouldn't have given it 121g. We also liked the build of the phone - again, it's not the best we've held, but definitely among the better ones. The back is made of polycarbonate that's good to the touch with a grippy grooved pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the back is a 13MP shooter with an LED flash. The camera can record 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy metallic accent on the back is a strip that circles the entire phone body. The sides of the phone hold the power button on the left, volume rocker and microSIM card slot on the right, microUSB port and mic at the bottom and 3.5mm audio jack on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5" IPS LCD screen has 1080p resolution (that's 441ppi) and fairly good image quality. The screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 3 with beveled edges. The Lenovo Vibe X has three capacitive buttons under the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is a wide angle 84° 5MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone runs Android 4.2 with Lenovo customizations on a Mediatek MT6589T chipset - that means a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor at 1.5GHz and PowerVR Series5XT GPU. It's okay in terms of speed, but the interface wasn't entirely smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone will come with 16GB or 32GB of built-in storage, there's no microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick hands-on video with the Lenovo Vibe X:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo S5000 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo S5000 has practically the same design as the Vibe X with the metallic strip that encircles the device, the patterned polycarbonate back and the glass-covered screen (well, without the capacitive buttons).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5000 is not as thin as the Vibe X but it's still pretty slim for a tablet, measuring a millimeter more (7.9mm). Its weight is more impressive - 246g or just over twice the weight of the Vibe X. The build quality is nice, practically the same as the phone's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7" screen is an IPS LCD again, but of WXGA resolution (1280 x 800). It's not as good as the phone's screen - noticeably less sharp and quite reflective too. Lenovo says the screen puts out 350nits of brightness, but that wasn't enough to compensate for the reflections. The company is silent on what sort of screen protection they've employed, if any.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo S5000 runs Android 4.2 with the same software customizations as the Vibe X. It's powered by a similar Mediatek chipset (MTK8389) with a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor at 1.2GHz and PowerVR Series5XT GPU. Despite the lower resolution of the screen, we still felt some minor lag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the back of the tablet is a 5MP shooter and the one at the front is 1.6MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The positioning of the controls is slightly different from the one on the phone - the power button and volume rocker share the left side (the right side is bare). The 3.5mm audio jack is still on top and the microUSB port on the bottom. This port supports USB OTG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet has 16GB of built-in storage, expandable via a microSD card slot. The 3G version of the tablet will also have a slot for a SIM card. That version supports 3G HSPA+ data connectivity but can also do voice calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo S5000 has a 3,450mAh battery, official numbers say it lasts 8 hours when browsing the web over Wi-Fi or 6 hours if you're watching HD videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5000 is priced to undercut the Nexus 7 (2013) by ?30 / ?20 for the respective Wi-Fi only versions. It is thinner and lighter, plus it has expandable storage, but the Nexus has a clearly superior chipset and sharper screen (1920 x 1200), a current Android version (and timely updates in the future) and optional LTE, so Lenovo is facing an uphill battle with the S5000 unless they go for a much cheaper price.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're fans of the original Yoga so we were excited to get our hands on the sequel, the Yoga 2 Pro. Lenovo has certainly improved several aspects of its convertible ultrabook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To start off, the Yoga 2 Pro is thinner and lighter - it now measures just 15.5mm thick and weighs 1.39kg, compared to the 17.1mm and 1.49kg of the old model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13" screen got a boost as well - it now has the whopping 3,200 x 1,800 resolution (up from 1,600 x 900) and the pixel density has gone up to tablet-grade 276ppi. The screen is an IPS LCD for great viewing angles and puts out 350nits of brightness but it was even more reflective than the S5000's screen (we had a tough time photographing it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the capacitive touchscreen can detect up to 10 fingers and is vital for Yoga 2 Pro's main trick. The ultrabook gets its name because of its flexibility - it can be used as a laptop, a tablet and in "stand" and "tent" modes (actually the Lenovo had set up the stand mode wrong, it's supposed to look like this).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to say about laptop mode - it's a touch-enabled Windows 8 laptop. Stand and tent modes are good for watching videos and using the Yoga as a compact all-in-one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet mode is what sets the Yoga line apart - bend the screen all the way back and the Yoga 2 Pro becomes a proper Windows 8 tablet. The keyboard gets disabled. Feeling the keys at the bottom is not ideal but not a deal-breaker either. This is a sturdier alternative to the detachable screen form factor that is gaining in popularity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite making the Yoga even thinner, Lenovo has kept the full size USB 3.0 and microHDMI ports next to a card reader. There's an additional USB port on the other side (but it's just USB 2.0) along with a 3.5mm audio jack, a volume rocker and a screen rotation lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro is powered by a fourth-gen Intel Core i7 ULT processor (Haswell), runs Windows 8.1, packs up to 512GB SSD and has a backlit QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Archos 101 XS 2, Archos Chefpad, Archos 80 Xenon<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ARCHOS has never been shy bringing its new offerings to IFA and this year is no different. The French brought a slew of slates including some, like the ChefPad and 80 Xenon, that were announced early on in the spring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Gen11 ARCHOS 101 XS 2 comes to replace the 101 XS we saw at last year's IFA and sports a pretty similar design. It also includes a keyboard dock accessory (much like its predecessor), which acts as a protective screen cover and favors desktop use. It attaches to the ARCHOS 101 XS 2 with magnetic hinges - the same proven design from last year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 101 XS 2 comes with a 10.1 IPS HD display, a 1.6GHz quad-core processor with 2 gigs of RAM and has stereo speakers on the front. The slate runs on an un-skinned version of Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ChefPad is a 9.7" Android Jelly Bean (4.1) slate with a 2MP snapper, 8 gigs of on-board storage and a dual-core 1.6 GHz processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ChefPad comes with its very own bendable kickstand and a rubbery red silicone case. If you slip it out of the case though it features an aluminum back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also unveiled back in spring, the ARCHOS 80 Xenon is an eight-incher with a resolution of 1024 x 768, a quad-core Snapdragon chip clocked at 1.2 GHz, 1GB of RAM and a 2MP camera. It runs Android Jelly Bean 4.1.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ARCHOS 101 XS 2 has quality written all over it. The subtle aluminum back nestled underneath plastic edges oozes quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen mounted on the ARCHOS 101 XS 2 is good although far from the best. It outputs good colors, brightness and viewing angles are impressive. However the glass on top of the display is extremely reflective and gets smudgy in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ARCHOS 101 XS 2 is light for its size and quite thin too. The keyboard dock has pleasant keys with good feedback and is generally comfortable to hold. However ARCHOS seem to have wasted a lot of space on the hinges, which in our minds could've been used wiser and with typing in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We come to the smaller 80 Xenon. The screen on it is a smaller 8-inch panel, which can brag about the same color reproduction, brightness and viewing angles as the bigger 101 XS 2 but is also let down by the highly reflective glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It feels higher quality in the hand compared to the bigger 10-inch slate. Overall we quite like the materials used and the nice solid construction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two speakers on one side of the slate while on the other sits the power key along with a two piece volume button, a 3.5mm headphone jack and a little cover for the SIM card and microSD card slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glass topping of the screen ends with silvery accented aluminum that folds over the entire side edges. The back is finished in quality-feeling glossy plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ARCHOS ChefPad feels like the 101 XS 2 in its build. It features an all-aluminum back and glass front. The protective case wraps nicely around the device and definitely gives it a safer feel but without it, the ChefPad becomes immediately higher end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the ChefPad is great but rather awkward at this aspect ratio for an Android slate. It's still a little better for browsing in landscape mode, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All ARCHOS slates we covered so far run well on their respective hardware and we think ARCHOS made the right call by not skinning the UI with their own custom theme. On the positive side, they?ve pre-installed a number of proprietary apps such as the cooking-related apps for the ChefPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's nice to see ARCHOS showing such dedication to quality finish each and every year but it would be nicer if we got to see its products more widely available.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel One Touch Idol Alpha hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel has created a premium phone in the Alpha - the phone has a curved aluminum unibody, it's just 7.5mm thick and features signature transparent elements on the top and bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone feels great in the hand - the curved aluminum rear is reminiscent of the HTC One, though not a blatant replica thereof. Still, coming from Alcatel this is good stuff - the One Touch Idol Alpha won't come close to the HTC's pricing (though Alcatel was mum on how much exactly it would cost).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transparent elements on the top and bottom give the Idol Alpha a distinct Xperia feel as the bottom strip is lit up by three LEDs, which work as a notification light. Unfortunately, Alcatel didn't learn the Xperia SL lesson and put the button icons on the transparent strip and the actual buttons above it, which takes some getting used to. Also, we wish the top strip was illuminated too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the phone packs a pretty nice looking 4.7" IPS LCD of 720p resolution for a solid 312ppi. The screen is protected by Dragon Trail glass (a lesser known Gorilla Glass competitor used on the back of the Sony Xperia Z) with oleophobic coating. Viewing angles are very wide and colors are quite punchy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back holds the main camera, LED flash, noise-cancellation mic and the loudspeaker grille. Unfortunately, Alcatel didn't give out any information on the camera specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Alcatel One Touch Idol Alpha feel very iPhone-ish with the strip that runs all along the sides of the device (even on top of the transparent strips). The sides hold the pretty flush volume rocker and power key, the microSIM slot (you'll need an ejector tool for this one) and the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is powered by an Alcatel-skinned Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean running on a quad-core 1.2GHz processor with 1GB RAM (the company once again skimped on the details). There's 16GB of built-in storage and no way to expand it, which was a little disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another problem is that there's no 4G connectivity - there's fast 3G with DC-HSPA+ (42Mbps downlink, 5.76Mbps uplink) but no LTE even though the seemingly lower-end Idol S has it (it has a microSD card slot too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We quite enjoyed the Alcatel One Touch Idol Alpha (especially the aluminum body and transparent strips). It's not the most feature packed device out there, but it's built way better than its standing in the pecking order suggests. It's great to see the company get out of its comfort zone and if this is priced right, it could be a hit in China (rolling out in early October) and Eastern Europe.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel One Touch Idol S hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The One Touch Idol S is the middle child of Alcatel's IFA lineup. It sports a 4.7" 720p screen and compares quite favorably against the Oppo R819, which we quite liked (the Idol S comes only in single-SIM flavor, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OT Idol S is shorter and narrower than the Oppo and only 0.1mm thicker - it measures a fairly impressive 7.4mm thick - and weighs the same at 110g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is a 4.7" IPS LCD of 720p resolution and the same 312ppi pixel density. It has Dragon Trail scratch resistant glass with oleophobic coating too. Image quality and viewing angles are good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are capacitive Back, Home and Menu keys below the screen and a 1.3MP HD front-facing camera above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is plastic with a nice soft touch finish and comes in Slate, Cherry Red and Fresh Rose. It's home to the 8MP camera that sticks out of the back, its LED flash, a noise-cancellation mic and the loudspeaker grille. The camera can shoot FullHD 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a flap on the right side of the Alcatel One Touch Idol S that covers the microSIM and microSD cards (there's 4GB of built-in storage, 2GB of that is user available). The power button is just below the card slots, the 3.5mm audio jack is on top, microUSB port and volume rocker are on the right and the main mic is on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean that has been modified by Alcatel. It's powered by a dual-core 1.2GHz processor with 1GB of RAM and we have to say we've seen smoother-handling phones (the Oppo R819 has a quad-core CPU of the same architecture). On the upside, the phone comes with Gameloft Live, Asphalt7, Wonder Zoo, Kingdom and Lords, Little Big City, and UNO &amp; Friends preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is very good with Cat. 3 LTE (100Mbps downlink, 50Mbps uplink), 3G with DC-HSPA+ (42Mbps down, 5.76Mbps up), dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, Bluetooth 4.0 and A-GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One Touch Idol S is powered by a 2,000mAh battery that Alcatel says will last through 8.5 hours of 3G talk time or 15 hours of music playback.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel One Touch Idol Mini hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel is in on the mini game as well with a 4.3" phone of its own - the One Touch Idol Mini. Specs won't set geeks' hearts on fire, but given Alcatel's affordable pricing, the Idol Mini has the potential to steal some users away from the Galaxy S4 mini and the HTC One mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One Touch Idol Mini is a little taller (2.5mm) than the Galaxy S4 mini, but is nearly 5mm shorter than the HTC One mini. It's also thinner than the both of them at 7.9mm and very light - we don't see a lot of sub-100g smartphones, but the Mini is one of them at 96g. All this gives it a proper right to call itself a mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Idol Mini follows the same basic design as the Idol S, except on a smaller scale. The phone has a 4.3" FWVGA screen (480 x 854) for 228ppi pixel density. It's an IPS LCD so it has good viewing angles and the image quality is fair overall but nothing spectacular. The screen has oleophobic coating to ward off fingerprints. There are three capacitive keys below the display - Back, Home and Menu - and a VGA front-facing camera above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the sides of the phone are one or two microSIM card slots - yes the Alcatel One Touch Idol Mini has a dual-standby dual-SIM option, a power button (not great positioning) and 3.5mm audio jack, a volume rocker and microUSB port plus mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the phone has a nice brushed metal finish to it and comes in Silver, Slate or Cranberry Pink. It holds a 5MP camera that protrudes quite a bit from the back. The camera has an LED flash and can record 720p video. The loudspeaker is also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Idol Mini runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean with Alcatel tweaks, powered by a dual-core 1.3GHz processor and 512MB RAM. As you can imagine it's not the smoothest phone around, but then again the Samsung Galaxy Core that is a direct competitor of this phone isn't any more powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Storage is 4GB (2GB user available) for the single-SIM version and 8GB (5.6GB user available) for the dual-SIM version. Only the single-SIM version has a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is pretty good with 3G with HSPA+ (21Mbps downlink, 5.76Mbps uplink), Wi-Fi b/g/n with Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 4.0 and A-GPS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 625 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia announced the Lumia 625 back in July, a couple of weeks after the company unveiled the 41MP Lumia 1020 cameraphone. This is also the last Lumia phone unveiled before Microsoft acquisition of Nokia Devices and Services. And while it's still unclear what will happen with the rumored Lumia 1520 phablet, the Lumia 625 has already gone on sale.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 625 has also made it to the IFA show, where we finally got to spend some quality time with the smartphone. It's quite an interesting gadget that offers big screen on a budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 is running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 chipset with a 1.2GHz dual-core Krait processor, Adreno 305 graphics and 512MB of RAM. Microsoft and Nokia successfully proved the Windows Phone 8 is a miracle worker that runs hassle-free on this, now considered lower midrange, hardware. Unfortunately for the gamers, there are lots of titles incompatible with WP8-handsets with less than 1GB of RAM, so the Lumia 625 doesn't quite make for a killer gaming experience despite its large screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we get this out of our way, let's focus on the positive sides of the Lumia 625.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, Lumia 625 comes with a big 4.7" IPS display of WVGA resolution. This adds up to a rather low 200ppi, but in this class it works quite fine. And it's not like the screen looks pixelated or anything - sure it's not the sharpest we have seen but with the WP8 interface it certainly isn't irritating. Besides, the screen offers lively colors, good contrast and decent (if not quite perfect) viewing angles. It isn't a ClearBlack unit, which suggests it probably won't do all that great outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a design standpoint, the Nokia Lumia 625 is pretty much an oversized Lumia 520. It has the same lines, layout of controls and similar back cover finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front has the three mandatory Windows capacitive controls below the display and the earpiece plus the secondary VGA camera for video chat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Lumia 625, just like the rest of the Lumia gang, houses the volume rocker, the Power/Lock key and the hardware camera shutter - all three of them made of plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is on the top of the Lumia 625, while the microUSB port is at the phone's bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is made entirely of polycarbonate. The curved shape and soft rubbery finish make for a handset that's got plenty of grip and style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera lens accompanied by a LED flash is at the Lumia 625's back. The loudspeaker grille is also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 625 is available in Orange, Bright green, Yellow, Black and White. We saw the orange and yellow units and they both look quite fresh with a distinct youthful appeal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large 4.7-inch display is not the only thing that sets the Lumia 625 apart from other midrange Lumia smartphones. The Lumia 625 also supports LTE connectivity, comes with a faster 1.2GHz dual-core processor compared to its 1GHz 520/620/720 siblings and offers 1080p video recording at 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 625 seems like a pretty decent deal, seeing it costs only about ?230. We will be able to tell for sure once we get a review unit and put it through its paces.</paragraph>
