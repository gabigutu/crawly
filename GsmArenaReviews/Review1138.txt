			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Taking a second to think can result in second thoughts. In the Galaxy 10.1 Note's case it resulted in a second pair of CPU cores and double the RAM - a lethal combination, which only a select few of its foes dare stand against.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is in case you are wondering why you're a reading another preview of a tablet that should've been launched a good couple of months ago. Sent back to the drawing board shortly after its official announcement, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 starts fresh after a reboot. And we have no choice but start over.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, the stylus-driven tablet has the same heart as the Galaxy S III beating beneath the 10-inch screen and twice the RAM to run the rich set of apps trouble-free. The Galaxy Note 10.1 doesn't run Android 4.1 Jelly Bean yet, but it comes preloaded with fantastic apps like Adobe's Photoshop Touch and Ideas. Not to mention Samsung's home-brewed S Note, S Memo and S Planner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, what was simply the artistic twin of the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 is now a supercharged version that belongs right in the premium class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we know how the Galaxy Note 10.1 has changed on the inside, let's try and spot the differences on the outside.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 10.1 still looks a lot like the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 but there are minor changes all over the design. As a result, the new version doesn't look as good as the original although, considering the ultra- minimalist design, the difference is very subtle. We do think though that the grip has been somewhat improved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal frame houses the two speakers on the sides (in landscape position) and has gotten wider at the top and bottom. In addition, the speakers themselves are now on the inside end of the frame, not in the center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware design changes continue at the back as well, where the frame extends to fit the camera department in. The nest of the camera lens is now a bit rectangular, rather than a circle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Built around a 10.1-inch PLS LCD screen with a resolution of 1280 x 800, the Galaxy Note 10.1 wouldn't wow anyone. Android slates such as the ASUS Transformer Prime Infinity and Huawei MediaPad 10 FHD are rocking full HD resolution, and the iPad 3 is in a league of its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the average resolution, the image quality is decent. Viewing angles are very good and blacks look reasonably deep (naturally, we'll take the usual measurements once we get our hands on a retail unit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pixel density is nothing to be excited about (149ppi), but big tablets like the Note 10.1 are viewed at a bigger distance than phones, so it's not much of an issue. Still, if you've seen the new iPad, the difference in sharpness is quite noticeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 has no hardware controls at the front - it doesn't need any with Ice Cream Sandwich inside. All you get here is the front camera and some sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no earpiece but the slate is capable of receiving and making phone calls in either loudspeaker mode or with a headset (wired or wireless).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two front-facing speakers are either side of the screen. We found this location to much better suit gaming and movie watching than the sides or the back of the slate. And since the speakers are positioned in the upper half of the tablet,covering them with your palms when holding the slate is not likely to be an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top (in landscape) we find the 3.5mm audio jack along with the SIM compartment and microSD slot, both protected by plastic lids. There's also the Power/Lock button next to the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microphone is at the bottom, which is something to consider if you're going to make calls in loudspeaker mode (the mic at the bottom might get muffled if the tablet is docked). Unlike the previous version of the tablet, the new design features a slot for the S Pen. It's located at the bottom right, just like on the 5.3-inch Galaxy Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 uses a proprietary 30-pin connector for charging and connectivity, which is centrally placed at the bottom of the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single, multi-function ports like the 30-pin connector on the Note 10.1 mean you'll need a proprietary cable for computer connections, charging and TV-out, which is hardly ideal. You get a cable and charger supplied in the retail package, of course, but if you want to have spares to keep in your office, for example, you'll have a much harder time getting them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the Galaxy Note 10.1 we find an updated 5MP camera with an LED flash next to it. The camera is quite capable of shooting the occasional photos and HD videos as long as you are willing to put up with the ridiculousness of taking photos with a 10-inch slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like before, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is powered by a 7000 mAh Li-Ion battery. There are no official battery life quotes yet, but we'll be doing our own tests when we obtain a retail-ready unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic put in use is from the glossy variety rather than the matte one used in the MWC-born Galaxy Note 10.1. It feels very nice to the touch, but can be quite slippery and attracts a lot of fingerprints. The good thing is they are not as easy to spot on our white test unit. You cannot pop the back cover open to access the battery, but that's to be expected from a tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 can be held with one hand and operated with the other, but at just under 600g you will soon need to find some kind of support. The thickness of 8.9mm feels better in the hand than 9.7mm of the Tab 2 10.1, though the portability of both devices is practically the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is quite good. Our test unit did produce the occasional creak while being handled more roughly, but the retail version might even have these sorted out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The redesigned S Pen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Pen stylus is what gives the tablet its name. Having debuted on the 5.3-inch Galaxy Note, and later in a new shape on the original Note 10.1, the S Pen has been redesigned yet again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest difference is it's now square in shape, with softly rounded corners, for a much more comfortable hold. It's shorter too and has gotten rid of the attaching clip found on the previous Note tablet's stylus. Not badly missed that one - the stylus compartment more than makes up. There's a button on the side of the S Pen, which can be used to perform certain actions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white tip is on a spring too, and you can press it against the screen of the Note 10.1 without worrying you'll damage it. That's good to know as chances are you'll be pressing it quite often - the digitizer can sense various degrees of pressure, which is an important feature when drawing. The Galaxy Note 10.1 also supports palm rejection - it can sense when your palm rests on the display when writing or drawing and ignores it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature of the S Pen is that it doesn't need to be touching the screen for the tablet to know where you are pointing it. This is especially useful in apps like the preinstalled Adobe Photoshop Touch, which displays a cursor to help you make selections and aim. It's like the hover touch technology of the Xperia sola, except that it's much more accurate and responsive here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich with a few extra touches thanks to Samsung's own TouchWiz UI. It adds several cool customization options, a few really useful shortcuts here and there and let's you makes use of the multitasking capabilities of the hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we get started, here's a short video of the UI in action. The newly designed S Pen also makes an appearance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ice Cream Sandwich interface is probably already a familiar topic, but Samsung has made some UI changes to the overall experience. Let's start with the homescreen of the slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation keys are placed in the bottom left corner of the homescreen: Back, Home and Task switcher (plus a screenshot key courtesy of TouchWiz). The search shortcut is visible on all homescreens in the top left, the app drawer in the top right and finally, the notification area with quick toggles (again, a TouchWiz thing) in the lower right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen panes may look like default ICS homescreens, but it's got a nice trick up its sleeve - the pinch gesture familiar from TouchWiz phones has been added to the Note 10.1 and it lets you add, delete and rearrange homescreens easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same pinch gesture can be used in the app drawer to again let you rearrange pages. You can't delete or add new pages this way though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The taskbar at the bottom has an arrow that flips up a row of what Samsung calls Mini Apps. The Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 had them too, so they're not new, but they're still exclusive to the Samsung tablet family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mini Apps are small, independent windows that are overlaid over anything else - homescreens, regular full-screen apps, anything. You can fit two or three of those on the large 10.1" screen and they really improve the multitasking abilities of the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Available Mini Apps include a dialer, messaging, email, calculator, music player, S Memo and S Planner, even a task manager. If you're not using some of those apps, you can always choose to hide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each Mini App has a button in the top left that launches the corresponding full-featured app and a close button in the top right. Such overlaid windows have been a staple of desktop OSes, but they feel a little odd in Android at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has the connectivity toggles that we've come to know from the smartphone edition of TouchWiz. They offer more functionality than the stock ICS quick settings - including GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth controls - which saves you the extra effort of entering the extended settings menu. The rest of the toggles are Notifications, Sound, Auto-rotation and Flight mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screenshot button available in the bottom left corner can be quite useful in combination with the S Pen - once you've snapped a screen shot (you can press and hold the S Pen's button to do that too), it appears on the screen and lets you scribble some notes and save the image for later, share it or queue it up to print.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 comes with tons of pre-installed apps - S Memo, S Note, S Planner, Social Hub, Music hub, Pulse reader, AllShare, Polaris Office, Video player, Video maker and My files. The Photoshop Touch and Adobe Ideas are a nice perk too, which we'll cover in more detail later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One feature that certainly many will appreciate is the split screen view mode, which,allows you to work with two apps simultaneously. Sadly it's not just any two apps, but two from Video player, Polaris Office, web browser or the S Note app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can copy text from one to the other, which can be quite convenient at times. Or you could simply open the web browser to check something without interrupting the video you were watching. Now add the Mini apps, and the Galaxy Note 10.1 becomes a true multitasking king among the slates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The second-gen Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is powered by the same Exynos 4412 chipset with a quad-core 1.4GHz processor and Mali-400MP GPU found in the Galaxy S III. And thanks to the 2GB of RAM, it should cope with anything you throw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the single-threaded BenchmarkPi, the quad-core Note 10.1 only did as good as its dual-core sibling and the Tegra 3-powered HTC One X.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack is optimized for multi-core CPUs and while the One X pulls ahead of the dual-core Note 10.1 by about 40% it can't match the quad-core Exynos 4412 in the Note 10.1.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to 3D graphics, the Mali-400MP GPU has repeatedly proven its worth and once again it offers very playable framerates. Note that the two phones - the One X and Galaxy S II - have lower resolutions, 720p and WVGA respectively, which helps them get higher framerates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two browser benchmarks we ran show even large improvement ofperformance than the dual-core version of the Galaxy Note 10.1. That's to be expected with the two extra cores on tap, but the updated Android version also plays its role. The Note 10.1 excelled in both the JavaScript (SunSpider) and JavaScript+HTML5 (BrowserMark) tests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Pen and S Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Pen sports the same wealth of features as before. You can use it for writing or drawing, but it can also be used to navigate the UI. With the button on its side, you can do gestures - a swipe to the left is back, a swipe down opens up the context menu and a double tap opens the S Memo mini app. A press and hold captures a screenshot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Memo app lets you scribble notes with the S Pen (or your finger). There are various pen styles and colors, as well as undo/redo buttons and an eraser if you don't fancy the look of your work. You can insert images from the gallery, other memos and even part of a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also has some pretty advanced functionality. It can recognize shapes, for example, so our squiggly squares and circles looked perfect. It can do standard text recognition too and, more impressively, recognize and calculate mathematical formulas! Furthermore, it'll give you a solution to a particular mathematical problem as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Note offers several templates that you can use to design professional looking cards that you can later export as an image file or PDF. They can have multiple pages too - PDFs are more convenient here as they keep all pages in one document. S Note is a great way to prepare presentations on the Galaxy Note 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While in edit mode, you can use two fingers to pan around a document (using just one would draw a line instead).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner is a custom calendar that has a lot of different views - Year, Month, Week, Day, Agenda and Task. It can sync up with several calendars (including the one from Facebook) and you can choose which ones are visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is beautifully designed and quite handy - with the month view in portrait, you can select a day and all events for that date will be listed at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photoshop Touch and Adobe Ideas<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Adobe launched Photoshop Touch as part of its Touch Apps suite and it is preloaded on the Galaxy Note 10.1. It's fairly simple to use with an intuitive interface, but there's a set of 13 tutorials just in case to teach you how to use the app. They come with all the required photos preloaded too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photoshop Touch features most of the core things you're used to in the desktop apps - layers with opacity and blend modes (no layer styles though), various image adjustments and effects, selection tools, clone stamp tool and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One cool thing about the S Pen is that you can hover - keep the stylus a few millimeters away from the screen and the app will display a cursor tracking the S Pen. This will really help you aim better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that improves accuracy is that you can rest your hand on the screen and it won't register as a touch. Having to keep your hands above the screen gets pretty tiring, so this is a great feature. It also gives you better accuracy with the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using a stylus is already a more natural way to draw than with your fingers, but the S Pen has one extra feature - it allows you to use different amounts of pressure, which dynamically control the brush width. It's very sensitive and there are a lot of pressure levels available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other app from the Adobe Touch Apps suite is Ideas. It is a much more basic sketching and note-taking tool and has two layers - one to draw on and another one as a background image. The only tools you get are a brush (with customizable size, color and opacity) and an eraser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ideas is meant to let you quickly sketch things to later upload to Adobe's Creative Cloud. There are other applications available for purchase such as Debut for presentations, Proto for designing website prototypes and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both apps, even though intensive, run smoothly on the 1.4GHz quad-core Exynos 4412 chipset and its 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser with a twist<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on Android has always been excellent and the Ice Cream Sandwich version is no exception. On the revamped Galaxy Note 10.1, the web browser UI has been altered to fit the overall design language and resembles Google Chrome for mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs are available at the top of the screen, so switching between them and closing unneeded ones is very easy. In the top right corner, you'll find the multitasking button we mentioned earlier and the extended settings button, which brings out cool features like Find on page, Desktop view, Save for offline reading and several others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing enabled by the S Pen that's missing in other mobile browsers is "mouse over". Some web pages have elements that react differently to clicks and hovering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that's missing from the browser's settings is the Brightness/Color, but it's okay since the pull-down notification area provides such an option and it is easy to access. There's also the Inverted screen rendering option, which turns the web page black and white (with white backgrounds becoming black). You can further tweak this effect using the Contrast slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser has a new trick too, one which it learned from its desktop sibling, Chrome. When searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result (and with Google's algorithms there's a good chance you will), it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster when you eventually click it. You can set this to work only over Wi-Fi or turn it off completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another trick the Android browser snatched from Chrome is the Incognito mode - there's no global setting, but you can open Incognito tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't like this desktop-like interface, you can enable Quick controls from the Labs settings, which reveal many controls (Tabs, URL, Reload, History, etc.) when you slide your finger in from the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, for the Flash performance - the Galaxy Note 10.1 does great at 1080p YouTube videos right in the browser. Flash games run well too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you find Flash content to slow down your page load times or cause stutter when panning, you can switch it to on-demand in the settings menu (or even turn it off altogether), but we doubt you'll need to do so on the Note 10.1.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 left us feeling pretty positive about its prospects. It has evolved into something more than a tablet - it's taken yet another step towards becoming a proper laptop replacement. The S Pen adds quite a lot to what you can do with a tablet and the split screen and mini apps make multitasking as good as we have ever seen it on a droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the usual Samsung manner, there's something for everyone with the Galaxy Note 10.1. Artists can do wonders with the preloaded Photoshop Touch, S Note and S Memo apps, but the average user can also scribble the occasional note or two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extra horsepower under the hood is welcome and, quite frankly, was a much needed boost for the Galaxy Note 10.1. Power users will be more than happy with how the slate behaves in heavy multitasking. Plus, the Note 10.1 was not going to be considered as a premium device with just the dual core chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's much more testing to be done before drawing final conclusions on the Note 10.1 and we'll try and answer all remaining question in our upcoming review. By the looks of it, though, Samsung may have another winner on their hands.</paragraph>
