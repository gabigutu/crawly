			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I667 Focus 2 for AT&amp;T is the third LTE addition to the carrier's impressive Windows Phone lineup. However, in order to avoid clashing with the platform heavyweights - the Nokia Lumia 900 and the HTC Titan II - the Korean offering undercuts both in terms of specifications and price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can probably guess, Samsung's approach towards its latest product to run Microsoft's mobile OS differs significantly than the aspirations of some of major its competitors. The Focus 2 is not meant to sell by the millions - Samsung has its perfectly established Android lineup up to this task. Instead, the white clad Focus 2 aims to offer an entry to the smartphone realm to all those people, who are still in the dark ages of feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Save for the LTE radio on board, there are hardly any surprises regarding the specifications of the Samsung Focus 2. Microsoft's strict Windows Phone hardware requirements, coupled with Samsung's large parts bin have resulted in a device, which despite being new to the market, is hardly unfamiliar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the full list of key features, which the Samsung Focus 2 has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can notice above, the spec sheet of the Samsung Focus 2 is business as usual. You get the standard Windows Phone 7.5 Mango fare, which, on this occasion, is wrapped in a good looking and compact package. Samsung have been careful to differentiate the handset from its competitors by outfitting it with 4" display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The situation is no different with the list of the smartphone's disadvantages. They are almost entirely related to the limitations of the OS on tap. Surely, the built-in memory could have been more, but, we suspect, that the price tag of the I667 would have suffered as a result. Besides, the potential users of the device are not likely to care about many gigabytes of storage available to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we are going to begin this review with a look at the retail package of the Samsung Focus 2, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Samsung Focus 2 for AT&amp;T is a US-only phone and it's unlikely it will be making rounds on the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A surprisingly good retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the AT&amp;T branded retail box of the Samsung Focus 2, we found a charger, a microUSB cable, the typical set of booklets, and (surprise!) a white colored premium headset from Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having a headset in the retail package means that as far as the essentials go, the Samsung Focus 2 has you covered out of the box. This is a welcome breath of fresh air, given the recent string of bare bones AT&amp;T devices' retail boxes we've encountered.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing revolutionary about the design of the Samsung I667 Focus 2 for AT&amp;T. The smartphone is almost completely a carbon copy of the Android running Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G for T-Mobile. We noticed that the two handsets share quite a few construction elements - a fact which should bode well for Samsung's production costs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Offered in an all white colored scheme with a glossy white finish, the Samsung Focus 2 is a handsome device. Its curves are a certainly a sharp departure from the utilitarian looking relative, the Samsung Focus Flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Built quality is typical for a Samsung smartphone. The Focus 2 feels well put together and capable to take a good amount of abuse - nothing to complain here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With measures of 121.7 x 62.7 x 11 mm, and weight of 122 grams, the Samsung Focus 2 is certain to appeal to those, who are looking for a compact smartphone. The relatively small for today's ever growing standards, 4" screen is the main reason for the pocket friendly measures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4" Super AMOLED unit with WVGA resolution, which the Focus 2 packs, is an old acquaintance of ours. The display is featured in quite a few Samsung offerings, and offers the usual blend of deep blacks and superb contrast ratios. The PenTile matrix is hardly cutting edge, but at this price point, it is hardly a surprise. All in all, the I667's screen is yet another case in point that AMOLED screens and Windows Phone OS are a perfect match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is where the earpiece, the usual set of sensors, as well as the front facing camera are located. Below it you have the ubiquitous for all U.S. Samsung smartphones, set of touch sensitive buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker, along with the latch for removing the battery cover is located on the left side. On the right, you will find the power/lock key, as well as the dedicated camera button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and a secondary microphone sit at the top. The microUSB port and mouthpiece reside at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera and LED flash, as well as the loudspeaker grille are located at the top of the device's back. The typical Windows Phone logo sits at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises under the battery cover of the Samsung Focus 2. The microSIM card slot and the 1750 mAh battery can be found there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given our previous experience with LTE packing Windows Phone hardware, we were a bit skeptical about our expectations for the Samsung Focus 2. Thanks to its relatively small and energy efficient display however, the handset managed easily through a full day of usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are conducting a full blown battery test of the I667, and will update you when it is over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Samsung Focus 2 is as easy as it gets these days. Given its pocket friendly measures, even one-handed operation is a walk in the park - a rare occurrence these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung I667 Focus 2 is a familiar looking and well put together device. Our initial impressions of its battery performance are positive as well. The small measures and white color scheme are sure to appeal a lot to the female users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone Mango behind the wheel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus 2 runs Windows Phone Mango - the proverbial puberty of an OS that feels more mature now but not quite there yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out our short video demonstration of the Samsung Focus 2 user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pushing the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. The background of the lock screen can be changed from either the settings menu or the picture gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device and reveals the live-tile Metro user interface. It's a very stylish vertical grid of Live tiles that can be rearranged as you like. You can place almost anything in the grid by selecting the Pin to start option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a clean and simple interface. The Live tiles display information such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more, all without the need to open up any of the respective applications. The Pictures tile shows an animated slideshow of your images. The Group tile lists friend updates. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts. But that's oversimplifying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A swipe to the left on the main homescreen opens up the application list or main menu. It offers a virtual Search button, which makes finding apps easier for those with many apps installed. Alternatively, you can just swipe the screen up and down to find what you're looking for. Tapping and holding on any of the apps lets you pin the selected item to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To open up the task manager on Windows Phone you have to hold the back button. Currently the WP7 task manager is nothing more than an app switcher displaying all of your currently opened apps. Visually it looks similar to that of Symbian or WebOS: thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right. You can swipe through them and pick whichever you're looking for. You can't directly close apps but by opening an app and then hitting the back button you'll affectively achieve just that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are always around 5-6 recent apps in the app switcher. Opening new ones clears out the old, so you'll practically never find yourself in a situation where you'll need to scroll through pages to find your desired app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like on iOS some apps have multitasking support and other don't, meaning that if an app supports it, once reopened it will continue from where you've paused it. If it doesn't support multitasking it will restart or reset itself and start from the beginning. Many people dislike this way of doing things but the main focus of the method is improved battery life and UI performance, which seems logical on an OS that supports single core chips only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking can be disabled from the settings to save battery. There you'll also find a list of all installed apps that support multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu reveals two sets of options - system and applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Applications settings enables you to configure individual settings for each app installed on the device - the People hub, Phone, Maps and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can't set wallpapers on Windows Phone the only visual setting that is configurable is the color theme of your UI. There are around 7 preloaded colors and two themes - dark and light. Some manufacturers have created their own theme, like the HTC green for example. We advise to keep the theme dark as it does provide better battery life due to the fact that Super AMOLED's don't require battery juice to display blacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate a text, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too (*cough*Android*cough*) but voice commands via Siri is a big bragging right of iOS (and a loudly touted one at that), so WP7.5 can brag about them too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>People Hub as a phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People hub on Windows Phone acts as a one stop shop for your contacts and social networks, like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. You have a scrollable list of all your contacts as well as a dedicated grid of letters for quick jump to any of your contacts. The What's new tab that aggregates status updates from all contacts and the Recent tab lists only recently viewed contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact's profile, you get everything from call, text, send email, write on wall, mention on Twitter and so on. The contact photo, along with its latest status update is visible on top. You also get specific contact's Facebook albums if you've linked it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting addition is the new History tab. The complete history of exchange with a contact is in one place listed by day. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features of the hub is Groups, a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Adding contacts to any group, renaming a group and so forth is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations (there's more location goodness coming on later). You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People hub is present in the Phone app too. It takes the form of a contacts tab but only instead of contacts, you have people with profiles - a term taken right out of social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends - everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate), you can also include or exclude Facebook friends, import only Facebook contacts that have a phone number and add several accounts to sync with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side shows only new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recently called contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact's profile shows the contact photo. Below that there are actions - "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Much like with most Samsung phones the in-call quality and signal reception on the Focus 2 were great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Focus S did well in recognizing our commands, though it did have issues separating the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name "Mandark".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist - it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What's missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone - a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can always exit to the homescreen to open an app, your contacts or anything else you might need. To get back to the call just selected the call notification at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there's an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging is a strong side in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech balloons and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are placed only when the conversation moves to a different platform so it's not cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which platform to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't attach anything to Facebook messages, you'll need to use MMS for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the new OS (that is dependent on the carrier and your plan). It works as you would expect, by letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email integration is a corner stone of any smartphone OS out there. Windows Phone doesn't lag behind here either. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages - those include the most commonly used such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing an email is pretty straight-forward - it displays the content of the email and atop it the subject and sender of the mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating a message is very simple too - just starting typing a contact's name and you'll get an automated suggestion box with names and emails. Type away and send your message, that's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation.You can also mark individual emails, make them read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to - there's no double tapping here. Hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone constitutes of the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes - that's it. The layout remains the same on all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also choose from a variety of foreign (other than English that is) languages and choose to reset suggestions in case you've overwrited a word you shouldn't have.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-res Picture tile is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub is among the most visually attractive in Windows Phone's arsenal and is dense with animations, transitions and more. It's the place where all of your pictures are stored, no matter if they are uploaded via Zune, downloaded from Facebook or made with the phone's camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as a background for the hub or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. New apps get integrated into the Pictures hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Pictures hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You still can't assign individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends or closed ones so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Pictures hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll unifies your entire collection of photos and videos, taken with the device, in a grid of 4x5. You cannot change the view of the camera roll. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or pinch to zoom. We appreciate that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing pictures via email still involves resizing but you can now share videos too, either via email or on Facebook. Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook or the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo. It's a nice feature but one that produces unrealistic results at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Pictures hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a time scroll and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn't recognize .AVI files - in other words, don't expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 - so, you can watch those formats on the Focus 2, it's just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer's capabilities).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music + Videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when synching with Zune. The third section is podcasts where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The favorite, repeat and shuffle buttons can be found on the right side of the song artwork in the Now playing screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During song playback you can close the Music + Videos tile and go anywhere in the OS - a simple press on the volume button will prompt a now playing tab to emerge from the top bar and give you forward, back and pause options, as well as a button to jump back to the music player. The lockscreen offers almost the same functionality, sans the jump to music player option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get radio and marketplace links in the Music &amp; Videos tile. It doesn't offer the option to listen to online radio stations so you would need to insert the headgear to get reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the current frequency in very large digits - swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction. You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen - like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nice 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus 2 is equipped with a 5 MP camera with autofocus, geo-tagging, image stabilization and a single LED flash. It can capture images of up to 2592 x 1944 pixels resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers very extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness, ISO and more. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key will wake the phone with a single press - that is unlock it and start the camera. There's an option that prevents the shutter key from starting the camera if the proximity sensor is triggered (to prevent accidental launches when the phone is in your pocket). This option is off by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the Samsung Focus 2 produces good results with faithful colors and nice detail. If you prefer punchier colors, you'll have to fine tune the camera using the available settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In low light the noise levels quickly go up and the images become much softer. Here is a sample.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>720p video recording is the best Windows Phone can do for the time being so the Focus 2 follows suit. It's not a bad quality cap by any means and for many people just the economy of on-board storage will be persuasive enough to opt for HD over FullHD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can use scenes, calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look at a Samsung Focus 2 720p video sample. The frame rate is high and smooth and there's plenty of fine detail. Overall, the Focus 2 produces some great videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared an untouched 720p video sample from the Samsung Focus 2 for direct download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus 2 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and dual-band 3G with HSPA (21Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LTE connectivity is at your service, should you be in an area where you it is available. The speeds are unsurprisingly amazing, though we wonder if the device actually needs them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA and stereo Bluetooth 2.1. Bluetooth is currently limited as to what it can do - there's no file transfer support, for one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing with a computer is done with the Zune computer application. It's the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your Windows Phone - there's no Mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync files with Zune over the USB cable and Wi-Fi. There's a Mac version of it available too - Windows Phone 7 Connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional SD storage isn't available on Windows Phone so the Focus 2 doesn't offer such an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another syncing option is the cloud. SkyDrive is a free Microsoft service that gives you 25GB of cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings Wi-Fi hotspot functionality too. All you need is an active SIM card with a data connection and you're all set.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer mobile does without Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer mobile is the go-to app for browsing the internet. It offers a pretty straight forward interface with the only visible aspect of it being the URL bar at the bottom fitted with a refresh button on the left. Swiping the bar upward reveals shortcuts for tabs, recent, favorites, add to favorites, share page, pin to start and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history but it does offer a very neat option to choose a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar, which is a handy shortcut for looking things up if you're not sure which site exactly will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we miss is text reflow (the automatic alignment of text into the screen) and the ability to open more than six tabs at a time. But performance is top notch - the browser relies on hardware graphics acceleration to provide smoother graphics (and video) and animation and uses the latest (and fastest) JavaScript engine too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft are so confident that they've set up a page specifically for testing the performance of your phone - both JavaScript and graphics. You can find the page here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing search on Windows Phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you search on Bing, one of the things that might be offered as a relevant result is an app from the Marketplace. For example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also offers song and barcode search natively. Sure there are apps for that on WP but it's neat to have it built right into the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera scanner can also snap a photo of text, perform OCR and translate it into another language.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Marketplace is where you shop for apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Currently the Windows Phone Marketplace offers over 45 thousand apps, which is enough to call a significant collection. Most household names like Angry Birds, Facebook and the likes are on WP7 so you don't have reason to worry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace is organized into four main sections - applications, games and music. A fifth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under Categories you'll also find the Samsung Zone, which offers some exclusive content for Samsung Windows Phone devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the try option, which is available to many games and apps. It gives you a trial of a game before you decide to buy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as a what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and featured apps provides users with the top grossing games currently in the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (it's 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace. We did test games like Need for Speed, Kinectimals, Angry birds and had no problems with the Focus 2, the 1.4GHz processor and Adreno 205 GPU were more than adequate in handling more complex graphics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps at the wheel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic mapping solution in Windows Phone is Bing Maps. They offer driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free in certain parts of the world but will inevitable take a hit once Nokia Drive gets really going as it offers free voice-guided navigation almost anywhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for Bing Maps's voice-guided navigation - here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that make reading easy. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though, it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all the new Maps can do for you though. The app will locate nearby points of interest with the new feature called Local Scout and it will even show you indoor maps of malls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from a "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse businesses, read people's review and find directions and contact information.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured Office<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive automatically syncs between the phone and your computer. In case you missed it, Microsoft are offering free 25GB of storage with each SkyDrive account (but individual files are limited to 100MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Locations tab lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through SharePoint or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Locations and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub offers Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors. Still the innovation that Mango has brought to Windows Phone Office is great and shows Microsoft is dedicated to improving the Office experience further.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Organizing skills are very well presented in the Windows Phone OS. Your garden variety apps for organizing your life are all preloaded and even if you need something more Samsung or the Marketplace will provide you with it for free in most situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's AllShare application has been around ever since the Galaxy S and we're glad to see it preinstalled on the Focus 2. It provides a simplified way of sharing your multimedia content via Wi-Fi, while Photo Studio gives you a set of shooting options for the built-in camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now application doubles as Daily Briefing, the app that serves to provide you with up to date information on current news, weather, stocks and calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone Mango provides users with the basics in smartphone organizing but, as we said in the beginning, if you need anything more the Marketplace is there too - it offers apps for just about everything - most of which are free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone website is the cloud of sorts for all WP7 smartphones. All you need to do to use the site is register your email (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) and then setup an account on your Windows Phone device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options given to you on the windowsphone.com website are limited to billing information and security. You can update your billing information, view the apps you've bought and go to the web version of the WP Marketplace and buy new apps. Note that they will be sent to your phone to be downloaded locally on the device, unlike on the Zune app for your PC or Mac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The features most important to users are the Find, Ring, Lock or Erase. To use them you'll have to input a phone number out of a total of 37 countries. After you've done this the website will have access to your phone's location so you'll be able to pinpoint its almost exact location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features are pretty self-explanatory - Ring will use your phone's ringtone to send a single if you've lost it around the house, Lock will lock it with a 4-digit PIN code and Erase will wipe all your sensitive data off the device so you don't have to worry about it falling into undesirable hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn't like about the windowsphone.com cloud is that it doesn't allow wireless sync like on the iCloud, for example. We just think that any cloud-based service should offer this. Also the number of countries that allow tracking your device is limited and many countries where WP is available won't have access to these much-needed features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the website includes guides on each individual feature of your phone and depending on where you live there's a very detailed list of providers and operators that offer WP handsets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Entry into the smartphone world can hardly get any easier than what you'll experience with the Samsung Focus 2. The smartphone offers a nicely looking, no frills, pocket friendly, and well built hardware package, bundled with a software platform which is well known for its elegant simplicity. The latter will surely appeal to many people who are switching from a feature phone. LTE radio on the other hand, future proofs the device quite neatly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP snapper of the I667 turned out to be a surprisingly good performer in both still and video capture. The retail package is also great. Quite frankly, we can't recall the last time we saw a headset this good in the box of an entry-level smartphone. We surely hope it won't be a onetime occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as limitations go, the lack of expandable memory is likely the biggest disadvantage of the handset. With only 6GB of user-available space, the Focus 2 is not for people with large music collections. Cloud storage is not a complete solution to this memory shortage. After all, you will still need to download the files to your handset before opening them. The aforementioned exercise, if repeated too often out of Wi-Fi connection, is certain to have an impact on your tiered data plan too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus 2 is priced at the highly affordable $49.99 with a two-year commitment to AT&amp;T. Like we mentioned already, the handset avoids clashing directly with the heavy hitters like the Nokia Lumia 900 and HTC Titan II. In case you are not familiar, the former cost twice as much, while the Titan II's asking price is $199.99.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most obvious alternative to the Focus 2 is the Nokia Lumia 710, which is offered by T-Mobile and costs as much as the Samsung. Spec for spec, the two devices are almost identical, save for their displays and radios. T-Mobile offers the best way to enjoy 3G in the States, so if LTE is not a must for you, you should take a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 710</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Radar is also a T-Mobile alternative, which packs similar spec sheet as the I667. HTC have done some clever software tricks with Windows Phone, which add a bit of Sense to it. The Radar's MSRP is $99.99 with a contract, but given that it's been around for some time, finding it for less shouldn't be an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Radar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AT&amp;T's own Samsung Focus Flash is also a great non-LTE alternative to the Focus 2. The metal clad smartphone looks better than the Focus 2, offers a slightly smaller display with better pixel density, and costs only a penny with a contract.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Focus Flash I677</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Focus 2 will not sell by the millions. It is not designed to do so. What Samsung have done with the I667 instead, is to create a well-balanced and cleverly priced device to keep the competition on its toes. Unsurprisingly, it is a task well executed.</paragraph>
