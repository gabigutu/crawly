		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The A-Team is back and we start with the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016). It pairs a premium build with premium features, a true S6 lookalike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A models for 2016 are Samsung's answer to the trend started by Chinese OEMs of making premium feeling midrange devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This makes the Galaxy A5 as much a OnePlus X/Xiaomi Mi 4c competitor as it is a Galaxy S6 alternative. Speaking of it, the S6 price hovers barely above that of the A5, so the young 'un has to prove it's just as good as the phone that started Samsung's mobile rebirth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Who would believe that an A-series phone will have features that are missing from an S-series flagship? And yet the microSD card slot is one of the major complaints about the S6. The boost in battery capacity is welcome, even though the battery itself is not removable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one major stumbling block may be the camera. Sure, the wide f/1.9 aperture and OIS sound great, but no 4K video feels like a big drawback. We're less worried about the drop in screen resolution, even if it seems major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original 2014 incarnation of the Galaxy A5 was ambitiously priced for the relatively limited feature set it offered. The 2016 model is a whole different story - it brings a much-needed boost to the screen and chipset, along with great camera specs and Samsung Pay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This makes the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) a clear upgrade path for those still holding on to an S5 or even S4 and it puts feature pressure onto the premium mid-range market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 (2016) retail package comes with all the bells and whistles. This includes a Fast Charger (15W) and a microUSB 2.0 cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Samsung's usual in-ear headset with a three-button remote.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) 360° spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 (2016) measures 144.8 x 71 x 7.3mm and weighs 155g. That makes it bigger and heavier than the Galaxy S6, most notable is the difference in weight (138g for the S6). You do get 0.1" more screen, though, a tiny 4% bump in surface area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What's the favorite snack of a premium phone? A glass and metal sandwich! Okay, okay, we won't quit our day jobs to pursue a career in stand-up comedy, but this is the most popular combo with the occasional all-metal phone or one that relies on durable plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) is one of the best executions of the familiar recipe, though, with beveled Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back and a metal frame shaped just like the S6 frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal sides are chamfered with small bumps at each of the four corners, which improve grip and give you a more secure hold on the otherwise slippery glass and metal exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bezels around the screen are pretty average, but Samsung designers created the illusion of very thin bezels. The black glass border on the left and right of the screen is very thin indeed and the sloping metal sides hide the additional thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 (2016) feels quite substantial in the hand, we had gotten used to phones of this size being lighter. That's neither a negative nor a positive, it's more of a personal preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two big changes grace the front of the new A5 compared to the 2014 model. First, the screen is much sharper, jumping from 720p to 1080p (slight bump in size too). Second, the Home key is now a fingerprint reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key is flanked by the capacitive App Switcher and Back keys, which seem to have lost the option for longer backlight timeout. Above the screen is a 5MP selfie camera with a wider aperture than before (from f/2.2 to f/1.9, should help with night selfies).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The beveled Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back creates a nice curve that continues into the metal frame. This is a lot more pronounced than on the Galaxy S6 and the phone feels better for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the sides is the standard affair. The Power key and card slots are on the right, both cards (nanoSIM and microSD) go on the same tray. On the left are the Volume keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal frame is not very thick to begin with and the chamfering leaves even less spare room for the side buttons, so on the Galaxy A5 (2016) they are fairly narrow. Worse, they don't have much travel either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you missed it, yes, the Galaxy A5 (2016) has a microSD slot. It only comes with 16GB storage though (and you only get 11GB or less available to you, it changes by the region). Android 6.0 Marshmallow has the option of virtually merging the internal storage with the microSD card, we're yet to see if TouchWiz will adopt that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our review unit is the DualSIM variety. Do note that this is a hybrid slot, meaning you can put two cards at most - it can be two SIMs or SIM+microSD, but you can't have a microSD if you're going to use the A5 as a dual-SIM phone. Note that there's a version of the phone, SM-510FD, where SIM1+microSD go on one tray and SIM2 is on a separate tray. That solves this issue, but not all Galaxy A5 (2016) dual-SIMs have two trays, so watch out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is pretty interesting as the glass covers a lightly textured surface. The back is available in Black, White, Gold and Pink while the front is almost always painted black (aside from the White version). The metal on the sides matches the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera may not have the S6's sensor, but it does have its wide f/1.9 aperture and OIS. And it doesn't stick out as much. It has a single LED for a flash. There is no heart rate/SpO2 sensor alongside it as there is on the S6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone houses the microUSB 2.0 port and the loudspeaker (hidden behind a grill of drilled holes). There's a mic on the top and on the bottom - the couple is used for noise cancelation and stereo sound recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) is a very well made phone - for some reason we find it more attractive than the Galaxy S6.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) features a Super AMOLED display, Samsung's specialty. It's a 5.2" 1080p screen rather than the 5.1" QHD unit on the Galaxy S6. Not that either number has a particularly huge impact on the experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we noticed is a slight flicker - practically all AMOLED displays (and some LCDs) have that effect, it's just that the effect is stronger on the A5. You can't really notice it with the naked eye, but the effect doesn't have to be visible to have an impact (some people can get headaches from screen flicker). At higher brightness the effect is less visible, it becomes strongest below 40% of the max brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 (2016) screen can scale its brightness from very dark 2.1nits (suitable for late night viewing) to very bright. At full blast on manual you get 420nits, a good reading slightly below the median maximum, but auto mode can push it as high as 600nits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as color rendering is concerned, the Galaxy A5 is spectacularly accurate in the provided Basic mode with an average DeltaE of 1.3. Color accuracy on the default Adaptive mode however is only average (Avg. DeltaE of 8.1).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even at manual mode's maximum of 420nits the display remains perfectly legible, but you can get even better performance if you toggle the Auto mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 (2016) does not have a Display mode setting like some other Samsung's. You don't really need one though - the display is calibrated and produces some of the most accurate colors you can see on mobile. It has an average deltaE of 1.3 and a maximum of just 2.2 - lower than the average for most displays out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) has a SingleSIM and DualSIM models, though which one you get is region dependent. Either way, the A5 has LTE Cat. 6 connectivity for fast mobile data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is handled by Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, no 802.11ac but that's not a huge omission. You do get Bluetooth 4.1 and ANT+ for low-power connections to sports wearables.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also NFC and MST (Samsung's proprietary tech that emulates magnetic cards) for Samsung Pay. They are paired with a fingerprint reader and allow you to pay with your phone at checkout, at least in the several pilot markets for the service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port lacks MHL, but it does support USB On-The-Go for accessories (storage or input peripherals). The port also supports fast charging (Quick Charge 2.0 equivalent), though there's no wireless charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the Galaxy A5 (2016) has FM radio, isn't that neat? We know many have moved on to streaming, but sometimes plain, old FM is more reliable than Internet services (no need to pay for data either).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone has a 2,900mAh battery, not bad for its size, especially considering the Galaxy S6 has 2,550mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Manager monitors app usage and will optimize apps that you haven't used for a while (preventing them from suddenly draining the battery).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, here you'll find two modes - Power saving mode and Ultra power saving mode. For both, you get an estimate of how much battery life you can expect if you enable the mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a bigger battery and a less demanding chipset, the Galaxy A5 (2016) aced the battery test. It posted an endurance rating of 91 hours with just one SIM. With both SIM slots occupied that dropped to 77 hours, but the standby battery draw remained very low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The individual tests were very impressive too - you can talk for nearly 21 hours straight or browse the web for 10 hours. Or watch a 12-hour movie marathon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Galaxy S6 you get a noticeable boost in endurance, while the individual tests are largely the same. The S6 does last an hour longer when browsing the web though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that these results are for the Galaxy A5 (2016) with Snapdragon 615, there's also a version with the Exynos 7580 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In 2016 we're transitioning to using a fixed 200nit screen brightness for our battery tests instead of merely positioning the brightness slider at 50% which worked out to a relatively random brightness level. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of 200nits, which we've chosen for our tests, has become somewhat of an industry standard. But more importantly, it's both the median and average value of the brightness levels at which we've tested all reviewed devices so far. This means our older battery life results will remain relevant and comparable. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) launches with Android 5.1.1 Lollipop as Samsung is yet to make the jump to 6.0 Marshmallow. The TouchWiz system adds many proprietary features, but it lacks some key improvements like fine-grain app permission control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone features a capable fingerprint reader, which is, of course, available for securing the lockscreen. It's quite fast (as fast as the S6), especially if you wake the phone with the Home key - all it takes to unlock the phone is to leave your finger resting on the key for an additional split second. This makes using the sensor and its security benefits seamless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is the standard TouchWiz base of operations, which includes the Briefing pane. It's basically Flipboard in disguise (and can be disabled if you don't like it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification area features a row of quick toggles. S Finder and Quick connect buttons are enabled by default, but you can hide them to free up more space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are fully supported and there are even A-series exclusives. Themes change wallpaper and icons and modify the look of some stock TouchWiz apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) comes with an average amount of apps pre-loaded. The built-in storage (16GB) doesn't leave much room - according to official specs, the user-available memory is around 11GB, but it may be less in some regions. Good thing you can pop in a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new galaxy A5 also offers split-screen multitasking. While it's better-suited for phablets, this mode allows you to chat with two friends at once or reference a document while writing an email. Not all apps support this split view, but all of the key ones do. The option to put an app in a floating window is not available.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) is powered by an octa-core Cortex-A53 processor. Samsung is cagey about chipset details, but our unit is built around a Snapdragon 615. The 2GB of RAM are below par for this price range. Also, the Adreno 405 GPU does not provide the smoothest of framerates for graphics intensive gaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 (2016) is available with an Exynos 7580 too, a very similar chipset with eight A53 cores and Mali T720MP GPU. This is not the version we're reviewing though, we have the S615 model and this page is based on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 5 shows a big improvement over the old Galaxy A5 (which ran on Snapdragon 410), but the new model has competition from some quite affordable devices such as the Xiaomi Mi 4c or the OnePlus X. The latter even uses a Snapdragon 800 chipset!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again the HTC One A9 (which is the expensive of the lot) has a Snapdragon 617 chipset, which got winded pretty quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Running Basemark OS II 2.0 on the Galaxy A5 shows similar findings - it's better than last year's model, but not as good as some cheaper handsets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Digging into the details, the CPU performance seems pretty great. Not Galaxy S6 great, but it gives the Snapdragon 808-based Xiaomi Mi 4c a run for its money (in multi-core performance, single-core is obviously a different story thanks to the two powerful Cortex-A57 cores that the Snapdragon 808 wields).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPU offers a 50% to 100% boost in performance compared to the older A5, but you still don't quite get awesome framerates. Even the old Adreno 330 in the OnePlus X is almost twice as fast as the Adreno 405.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the Galaxy A5 (2016) doesn't support OpenGL ES 3.1 at this point even though the chipset should theoretically support it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 (2016) is a sizeable upgrade over its predecessor in terms of overall performance. You won't get to enjoy graphic-intensive games at fluid framerates, but the bigger issue is that you can get better performance for less money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At its current price point, we would have liked a Snapdragon 808 to be at the heart of the A5. The HTC One A9 is in a similar boat - too pricey for its S617 chipset - but that's no excuse as LG, Xiaomi and OnePlus found a way to offer you more bang for your buck.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) is the dual-SIM model, but single-SIM versions are available too. The SIM card manager allows you to pick a preferred SIM for voice, text and data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is a dual-standby phone - if you get a call on SIM1, SIM2 will be out of reach for anyone who tries to call you. However, you can optionally have the calls to the out-of-reach card forwarded to the active card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung dialer shows two dial keys (if you have two SIMs) so you can easily dial with either card. The call log can be filtered by SIM1 and SIM2, also by missed or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode can be put on an automated schedule. When it's on, only priority notifications can get through and you decide what's a priority - you can set anything from calls from select contacts to reminders from key apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) and its singular loudspeaker scored a Below Average mark on our loudspeaker test. It has plenty of company down there - the iPhone and HTC One A9 to name a few. It performs evenly across the tests (speech, music, ringtones), but neither is particularly loud.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 (2016) uses an updated version of the Samsung Keyboard. It's quite feature-packed, with a dedicated numbers row, a row above that for word suggestions and additional characters on each key (accessible via long-press).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If that seems too tall, you can scale the keyboard down (or up, if you want bigger keys). We don't like that the Space key is quite short, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional typing tools include swipe input, My Hot Keys (predefined phrases that can be typed by long-pressing a number key) and voice dictation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung continues to bundle the Microsoft app package, that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Skype. Note that these are just icons, you have to download each app from Galaxy Apps before you can use them (this way they don't take up storage if you don't want them).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's Drive is pre-installed, however, the actual document editors are not (they are a free download, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung-customized web browser features Web sign in - a feature that works as a password manager secured by your fingerprint. This makes log-ins as simple as unlocking the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Health is on board though without the advanced sensors (heart rate, blood oxygen) its functionality is more limited. It can still track walking/running/cycling and you can manually input water and coffee intake and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Manager is a hub that controls several key areas - battery, RAM, Storage and Device security. This gives you tools to track down apps that drain the battery, use too much RAM and clean-up unnecessary files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Device Security tab lets you activate KNOX (protects the phone and OS from attacks but adds a second to boot time) and scan for malware. The My KNOX app lets you separate work and personal apps by creating a secure, isolated space on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is the default file browser. It features Google Drive integration. You can ZIP folders to make them easier to share as a single file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Switch you'll probably use just once, but it's still handy. It lets you import your content from your old Android, iOS or BlackBerry device. For iOS it pulls data from iCloud, for the other platforms, the transfer happens either wirelessly or via USB (which is faster).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's Galaxy Apps, Samsung's own app store. Galaxy Essentials is a good place to find great tools (like Kids Mode), but for general app shopping, you would probably be better off with Google Play.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz gallery orders photos by time, but you can switch to folder-based Album view. Sharing options include wireless printing, Android Beam and Wi-Fi Direct, but no DLNA (or other way to send an image to your TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several image editing tools are available - from basic cropping, to collage making, to a more capable editor (which supports image correction, effects and drawing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An additional option lets you pick several photos and stitch them into an animated GIF.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with advanced EQ features, FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 (2016) gets the full-blown Samsung music player. This includes the SoundAlive tool, which has an intuitive interface to tuning the equalizer (a manual 7-band equalizer is available for more knowledgeable users).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adapt Sound is even simpler. It tunes the EQ to your hearing and your particular pair of headphones by playing multiple frequencies and asking how well you hear them. Smart Volume automatically adjusts the volume of tracks from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player itself has a straightforward UI with most functions available as shortcuts on the Now Playing screen. You can browse files by folders, which is great if your library doesn't have well-organized ID3 tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 also has an FM radio built in (something many Galaxy flagships do not). It can record radio broadcasts (though this may be disabled in some regions). There's no RDS though, so the app won't show the name of the station.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is the only app that works in pop-up window, a feature dating back to the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get full subtitle support with advanced features to modify their appearance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app lets you play only the audio (if you just want to listen to a music video) and to play the audio via Bluetooth (if you have a BT-enabled speaker handy).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an "Editor" option too though that may be overstating it - it just lets you trim the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, there's no DLNA or another wireless method of sending the video to a bigger screen. No wired ways to do it either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output starts off strong, loses some brilliance with headphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5(2016) showed perfect clarity in the first part of our audio quality test. When attached to an active external amplifier, the smartphone produced great scores top to bottom and things were pretty great in terms of loudness too, for a great performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in our standard headphones did cause some damage - volume dropped to only average, stereo crosstalk rose to a similar rating and some distortion crept in. It?s still a very good performance, but no longer up there with the best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) camera department is built much like that of the excellent Galaxy S6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It starts off with a downgrade - the sensor has 13MP resolution (and it's 4:3 instead of 16:9). Other than that, the camera boasts the same bright f/1.9 aperture and optical image stabilization. And like on the S6 you can just double tap the Home key to quickly launch the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The A5 offers Pro mode, but it's nothing like the one on the S6. It only gives you White balance, ISO and Exposure compensation. Essentially, the settings most phones have, but in a more accessible arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR is split off into a separate mode instead of a toggle on the viewfinder like on the S6 (this means no HDR Auto mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A rare Anti-fog option corrects the reduced contrast you get in misty weather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 28mm field-of-view of the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) camera isn't as wide as the Galaxy S6 camera, but it does give some extra vertical room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dynamic range is surprisingly good but processing differs from the S6 and detail in the shadows and in the highlights is harder to see. There's a bit more noise, but photos are rich in detail. At 100% magnification, you can see more detail in S6 photos than in the Galaxy A5 photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shot-to-shot time is okay, but when taking multiple photos in quick succession the A5 feels a bit sluggish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried the HDR mode in this particularly tricky scene where the angle of the sun completely blew out the sky. HDR helped a bit but not enough to produce a usable shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 5MP camera with f/1.9 aperture rivals the S6 for selfies. The Galaxy A5 (2016) selfies have some noise, which reduced the resolved detail, but the quality is better (marginally) than what the S6 produced. Part of that is that the focus point is more appropriate for selfies - photos from the S6 camera were slightly soft at an arm-length distance for some unknown reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A wide selfie mode is available when your friends are with you. It's essentially a panorama for selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Panorama mode too, though it proved disappointing. The images came out with a vertical resolution of around 1,200px, while the Galaxy S6 goes up to 3,000px. The stitching looks good, but the Galaxy A5 (2016) panorama shots just don't have enough resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While both phones have bright f/1.9 apertures, the bigger sensor handles the dark noticeably better. It's not a matter of resolution, really, and even the noise levels are quite similar. Still, by the time the noise reduction has done its job, the Galaxy A5 (2016) have lost much of their detail and sharpness, especially compared to the Galaxy S6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This A5 vs. S6 fight continues over at our Photo quality comparison tool. You can also compare their low-light performance there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're willing to swallow the resolution drop when going from the S6 to the Galaxy A5 (2016), even the S7 is rumored to go back to 12MP. It's the lack of 4K video that bugs us - even if you tend to use 1080p most of the time, the A5 is too pricey not to offer the best features. You don't even get 1080p @ 60fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of resolved detail and sharpness, the Galaxy A5 (2016) is slightly behind the S6. The advantage in resolved detail only grows bigger when you flip to 4K mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, white balance of the A5 tends towards a warm yellow. Dynamic range is essentially equal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even for selfies, the A5 is behind on video resolution - the S6 camera can do QHD (1440p) while the A5 tops out at 1080p again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the Galaxy A5 (2016) compared against the Galaxy S6 in our Video quality comparison tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Build quality rivals Galaxy S6 (kinda heavy though)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is good quality despite the drop in resolution (the flicker may bug some, though)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Great battery life with 91 hour endurance rating (still great with two SIMs too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Full software package with split-screen multitasking and first-party Samsung apps</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fast fingerprint reader (as fast as on the S6); Samsung Pay (in select regions)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPU isn't up to the task of 1080p gaming</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Great multimedia app package with advanced music player, FM radio too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is fairly quiet, even with a loud ringtone</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perfect audio quality if you have an external amp, but volume drops when you plug in headphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo quality is comparable with the Galaxy S6 (though not quite as nice); Pro mode is more a name than a feature; bright aperture and OIS are appreciated though</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos come out very good, but no 2160p and no 60fps mode are an issue</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Alpha was Samsung's attempt go shake off its phablet obsession and create a compact flagship. The Galaxy A series, which it helped spin off, occupied a lower segment than the flagship-grade Galaxy Alpha.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the 2016 edition, the Galaxy A returns to the finer things in life. The Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) in particular actually looks and feels like a slightly better Galaxy S6 thanks to its fine metal frame and sculpted glass faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quality is not the only reason we compare these two - with the S7 around the corner, the S6 will likely be phased out and the A5 may be the first step in replacing it with an alternative in another segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It already has a fingerprint reader and Samsung Pay, to support Samsung's foray into mobile payments. The camera with f/1.9 aperture and OIS make it even more clear this is a premium product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's just one issue with that. Currently, both phones cost almost the same. And while the Galaxy A5 (2016) has its virtues, the Galaxy S6 is just the better phone. Its single biggest sin is the lack of a microSD card. But you get a better screen, a much faster chipset (for gaming), a more capable camera too, plus smaller goodies like fast wireless charging and health sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Really, we think the choice of chipset is what brings the Galaxy A5 (2016) down. We can live with the drop back to 1080p screen resolution, but even that is too much for the GPU. And the chipset is what bars the camera from 4K and 1080p @ 60fps video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A5 (2016) is more comparable with the HTC One A9. It has an all-metal frame and a 5" AMOLED display with 1080p resolution. It shares A5's critical flaw too - a weak(ish) chipset, which limits the good 13MP f/2.0 camera with OIS to 1080p video max.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One A9 even has a fingerprint reader, though you'll have to rely on Google's mobile payment system as HTC doesn't have its own. The A5 is quite pricey, making its limitations hard to swallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OnePlus X is a more affordable 5" AMOLED option. It's a combination of metal and glass like the A5. OnePlus made an odd decision to go with an old chipset - Snapdragon 801, which dates back to 2013. But it has paid off if you look at the gaming benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the X is a 13MP shooter with phase detection AF, but it lacks OIS and its aperture is a tight f/2.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Mi 4c isn't as fancy - it has a plastic back and an LCD screen - but it's cheaper too (no microSD slot means you have to splurge for the 32GB version though). And the 13MP f/2.0 camera with phase detection AF doesn't have OIS, that's a rare feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Mi 4c has a Snapdragon 808, what the LG G4 and V10 use. It too smokes the S615 on gaming benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, let's mention the size options. The 2016 A-series has both the bigger Galaxy A7 (5.5" 1080p) and the smaller Galaxy A3 (4.7" 720p). The A7 has much the same features as the A5, while the A3 is a noticeable step down (an even weaker chipset for one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We think the price of the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) has to come down (and it will) before we can talk about buying the phone. It's a fine phone, but only a bigger price difference with the Galaxy S6 can make it a worthwhile choice.</paragraph>
