		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android elders must be staring at this one in disbelief. Looking down at it for all we know, measuring it up. What about the BACKFLIP? We guess it?s exactly the kind of gadget to stare back, humble but defiant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android was a life-saving blood transfusion for Motorola. Not only did the MILESTONE put them back on the map ? it gave them a license to experiment. They didn?t think twice to take it. So here we are, watching the BACKFLIP do the robot dance. This one is no ordinary droid, though at first it might look like a faithful follower of the G1. QWERTY keyboards fell out of Android favor soon after the G1 but we?re witnessing a strong comeback, much credit for which goes to Motorola.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, QWERTY it is but the Motorola BACKFLIP wants to have it its own way. So much so that it doesn?t seem to care what you think. Unique as in ?shame no one thought of it before? or in a freak of nature sort of way, the BACKFLIP won?t leave you indifferent. It?s got a one-of-a-kind form factor written into its name but the whole backflip thing seems to serve a higher purpose than simply drawing attention to an otherwise ordinary package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It all makes sense once you?ve used the BACKFLIP for a while. The uniquely folding full QWERTY keyboard, the BACKTRACK touchpad and the capacitive touchscreen are all there to put you in control. It?s an unusual phone to interact with but in a good way. On the inside, premium connectivity options are standard here, but the earliest Android version does sound underwhelming. It has the social-networking-centric Motoblur on top and that makes sense in a QWERTY-enabled midrange smartphone. More importantly though, the promised Android upgradeability makes the BACKFLIP likely to stick around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everyone is keen to make Android phones, but Motorola seem to know how to make a difference. The BACKFLIP hits the right spot and the novel form factor puts together standard navigation tools to offer unique handling. The back-folding keyboard may look like a questionable choice, but it won?t take you long to reconsider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BACKTRACK touchpad at the back of the screen is another nice touch. It does what a front-mounted trackball will do but on the BACKFLIP you scratch the phone?s back instead. Anyway, effectively you have three different ways to interact with the handset: touchscreen, touchpad and a full QWERTY keyboard. Just imagine BACKTRACK on a transparent display ? wicked stuff. But who knows maybe that?s where it?s all heading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we for one are not going anywhere before we?ve seen all of the BACKFLIP.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Tiny retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The moderately-sized retail box does well to cover the basics. A charger is supplied, along with a microUSB cable to use with it, or connect to a computer. There is also a one-piece headset which isn't your only option though since the BACKFLIP has a 3.5 mm jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a 2GB microSD card bundled with the BACKFLIP. Don?t go looking for it in the box though ? it?s already inserted into the device and ready to use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola BACKFLIP 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 108 x 53 x 15.3 mm the Motorola BACKFLIP is obviously not the smallest QWERTY smartphone out there but still reasonably compact. The front of it looks very much like the iPhone but we guess this is the least likely of all phones to be blamed of being a copycat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hinge is solid, allowing still a smooth and effortless folding motion. In its open position the screen is not absolutely level with the keyboard, but has a slight tilt for comfortable viewing. The whole setup is secure and easy to use. The keyboard is spacious and offers quite a number of handy shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting that there?s an automatic desk mode. When you open the flip to a certain extent, the screen automatically rotates in landscape mode and displays a special standby screen with a large clock. There?s even a convenient option of starting an image slideshow from this standby screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BACKFLIP weighs 133 grams and it feels just perfect. The lower deck (keyboard) accounts for much of this weight allowing a secure hold when typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s pretty much the folding communicator form factor but not in the buttoned-down style of business devices. The Motorola BACKFLIP is keen to flaunt its buttons and that?s what makes it unusual. The outward facing keyboard may be too eccentric but we still think the BACKFLIP will connect with its target audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP packs a 3.1? capacitive touchscreen with 320x480 pixel resolution. The size and the resolution are OK, but we?re not impressed with the colors and sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BACKFLIP?s display is 256K-color capable but, due to Android OS 1.5 restrictions, the effective colors are 65K. Banding is quite prominent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upgrading to later Android versions with support for 256 000 colors will possibly resolve this issue. Unfortunately nothing can fix the poor sunlight performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note, the capacitive touchscreen is very responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you unfold the keyboard the UI automatically rotates to landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three capacitive controls, which are equally sensitive so the transition to and from the touchscreen is seamless. The touch-sensitive buttons have solid backlighting and nice haptic feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from a dedicated Search key, the typical Android buttons are on hand ? Back, Menu and Home. The Search key is placed on the QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece is centrally placed above the display, a subtle Motorola logo and a proximity sensor on each side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Motorola BACKFLIP features no controls ? it?s where the hinge is. By contrast, the right side is quite corwded ? there?s the volume rocker, microUSB port and the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port has no protective cap over it. Instead, there?s a green LED enclosing the actual connector, which emits light when you plug the charging or data cable. It also blinks to alert when the battery charge drops below 15%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top we find the power/screen-lock key and the 3.5 mm audio jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfolding the phone reveals the neat rear ? the actual back of this two-faced handset. The back of the keyboard is the battery cover, which is a breeze to open and fit back in place thanks to the nice release knob. Under the thin metal cover are the battery and SIM compartment, along with the microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card slot is hot-swappable but getting there involves an extra step: you need to unfold the keyboard to release the cover and handle the card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the screen has one of the BACKFLIP?s key features ? the BACKTRACK touchpad. It?s a centrally placed touch panel that does a job of a trackball. You can use it to both scroll and select. Short sweeps without lifting the finger will let you jump selectable items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wide side-to-side sweeps will scroll lists, images or homescreen panes. Wait for this ? a double tap confirms. It?s like a notebook trackpad (without multitouch gestures though). And yes, we know it?s not essential in a full-touch phone but we still like the BACKTRACK.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing at the back of the screen looks like a loudspeaker but it?s not. Placed exactly opposite the earpiece, it?s perhaps part of the noise-cancellation equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is under the battery cover, similar to the Motorola MILESTONE solution. The thing is there?s no actual loudspeaker grill on the BACKFLIP. The battery cover is suitably etched though at the end that falls on the speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a certain issue with the way the phone folds. The screen folds over the rear cover and the speaker gets notably muffled. On the other hand, the loudspeaker location is perfect for placing the half-open phone on a desk to watch videos or listen to music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let?s talk about the keyboard. Spacious four rows of large and brilliantly backlit keys is quite the way to start. It?s a flatbed single-sheet keyboard with no actual gaps between keys. This makes sense: a keyboard that?s always exposed is thus more protected against dust and humidity. As a result though, keys have a rather inadequate stroke and tactility, but their size certainly makes up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are handy shortcuts to messaging and the web browser. A dedicated search button is also there, as well as a Home and a Contextual Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really hope the rubbery material and the character inscriptions on it will be sturdy enough to withstand the daily wear and tear in the long run. After all the BACKFLIP will spend quite some time lying on its back (the keyboard).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing to find on the BACKFLIP?s keyboard is the 5 megapixel lens and the LED flash. The specific form factor has forced this solution but we think it works. For one, the BACKFLIP does not need a secondary video-call camera at all. It will appear strange to onlookers that you?re taking a picture with the keyboard but no big deal. It?s quite handy too for self-portraits and video chatting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Motorola BACKFLIP is excellent and the unusual form factor works quite well. Both rear plates ? of the keyboard and the display ? are metal and enhance the solid feel. The plastic used on the front and sides looks quite durable too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP is the right size and weight to work comfortably with. The full keyboard is remarkably spacious ? the outward fold has let it use all the available space. The low key stroke may be an issue for some but the size of the buttons is more than comfortable. The screen can be tilted in various positions and that?s another pint in favor of the BACKFLIP.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Android in a BLUR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP comes with the version 1.5 of the Android OS, which seems a bit outdated now that version 2.1 is already available on several handsets. However, the MOTOBLUR UI that comes preinstalled is quite a nice add-on and some (social-networking addicts mostly) might even prefer the BACKFLIP software to, say, the MILESTONE package (Android 2.1 and no MOTOBLUR).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, having them both would be getting the best of both worlds but this is still not an option as MOTOBLUR isn?t available for Android 2.1 just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen of the Motorola BACKFLIP is pretty much stock Android at first sight but the MOTOBLUR custom widgets make it even easier than before to stay on top of your favorite social networks and emails. Facebook, MySpace and Twitter all have their reserved spots by default on one of the five homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a happenings icon in the main menu to bring all the events from those networks in one place. You can further choose to filter the notifications from only one of the social hubs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a new icon added at the bottom, right next to the the arrow button that pulls up the main menu. It takes you to the reskinned phonebook, which is also in the social-network integration game with a few new tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another novelty brought by MOTOBLUR in terms of general interface is the account manager which allows easier management of all your email and social-network accounts by gathering them in one place. This time you don?t need to go to the each app to set up an account or delete it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really cool security feature of the MOTOBLUR UI allows you to remotely lock your phone and wipe all the information in case it gets stolen or missing. It can then be recovered by simply entering your MOTOBLUR account details. Once its unlocked all the erased data is automatically restored and you can continue using the phone as you did before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new battery management tool allows you to make your battery last longer by picking one of the three usage plans. Those can automatically turn off your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios when idle for a certain period and decrease the brightness of your screen when the battery level drops under a certain level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to all those extra goodies, you also get the traditional Android OS perks. The notification area gets pulled down from the top and gathers all the events requiring your attention. The task switcher is launched by holding the home menu key and holds shortcuts to the six most recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are also the traditional Android widgets, shortcuts and folders that can be used to populate your homescreen and have all your frequently used apps a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pretty unique feature of the Motorola BACKFLIP is its clock, which gets activated when you fold the handset about half-way while it?s on the idle homescreen. In addition to displaying the clock it also gives you information about the weather and gives you shortcuts to starting a slideshow or activating an alarm. You can switch the backlighting off to save battery and use it as a dedicated alarm clock (or picture frame if you go the slideshow way).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no living wallpapers here (as in the Google Nexus One) and the homescreen estate is only 5 panes, instead of 7 (Sense UI HTC handsets) but those are things you can live with. Besides, you can always go for a different homescreen by simply downloading it off the ever expanding Google Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another good part about the Motorola BACKFLIP is that the handset feels reasonably snappy with not too many lags. There?s no 1GHz Snapdragon inside but the HVGA screen is less demanding so the less powerful CPU does well most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get a better idea of the BACKFLIP performance you can check out the video below that we snatched from our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is also BLURred<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is another part of the Motorola BACKFLIP software package that was tweaked by the MOTOBLUR UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once inside, you are presented with three tabs. The contact list is the middle one and it?s the default to start. You are free to filter your contacts by groups, favorites, or by any of your social networks. So it?s pretty easy to see only the contacts that you have added to your Facebook, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right tab holds the status of all your contacts that have a social network profile of some kind linked to their contact info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left tab is History and it holds all your recent communications, including social network updates, calls and emails. That creates somewhat of a mess with all the contacts going into the mix but luckily you can check out the history and social-network updates of each contact individually in their profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact profiles also use a three-tab layout with their details in the default, middle one. Happenings go to the right and history goes to the left. Quite the app to have if you hate being off Facebook and Twitter even for a minute, right?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony does well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We had little issues with the signal reception and in-call voice quality of the Motorola BACKFLIP. The phone?s earpiece is loud and clear enough and the volume in loudspeaker mode is good enough in most scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features a regular phone keypad, a list of your recent calls and a list of the most frequently called contacts. There is also the traditional speed dial list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in proximity sensor the phone?s display automatically gets switched off when you hold it next to your face during a call. That way you don?t risk pressing any keys by mistake with your ear or cheek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conducted our traditional loudspeaker test on the BACKFLIP. It got a Good mark, ranking just above the middle of our table.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging all set and ready to go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging is definitely among the Motorola BACKFLIP and MOTOBLUR elements. The UI adds a consolidated inbox to let you see all new stuff without needing to browse several apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like on other Androids, if you have only one SMS message, a line in the notification area displays the sender and part of the message itself. If you have two or more messages, you are simply informed of the number and once you hit the icon you?re taken to the Messaging Menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating as the text box only takes a single line of the screen even if you hide the virtual keyboard, which really only gives you little space to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The automatic suggestions will appear and you can easily select one by tapping it. The BACKFLIP shows the name and number/email of each of the suggestions so you won?t end up using the wrong number for some of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can choose to go into a full-blown slideshow editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail is one thing that you can't expect to have changed much compared to other Android handsets. Batch operations are available and the mails that go into your Gmail are also stored in your consolidated inbox so you might not even use the Gmail app that often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interfaces of both the Gmail and Mail apps have been slightly polished with several icons in the menus changed. The extended Gmail features include spam report and of course conversation-style view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When replying to an email you can opt for either Gmail or the generic mail client, and set one of the two options as default. The reason behind most Android handsets coming with two email clients is the added corporate Exchange ActiveSync support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As customary for the platform there is also a standard email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. Sadly, the emails are not displayed in threaded pattern like those in the Gmail app, but you still have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a hardware keyboard chances are that you won?t use the screen of the BACKFLIP for much text input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Motorola offers the traditional Android keyboard that operates in both portrait and landscape modes. It certainly doesn?t have the largest keys in business but will do for quick jobs.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Refreshed image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola BACKFLIP brings a new gallery view mode, which looks pretty attractive. The 3D effects and smooth scrolling add to a pretty pleasing user experience in general.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the calendar dates on the right (or at the bottom if we are talking landscape view) to browse longer list of images and there is a mark feature for multiple deletion or tagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual shortcut that allows you to share your images over email, MMS, MySpace or Picasa is now updated to support MOTOBLUR?s own photo sharing service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately sharing multiple photos at a time isn?t available nor is sending images via Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP supports three zooming methods ? you can use the onscreen virtual controls or you can zoom straight to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. There is also a one-finger zoom using the trackpad at the back of the phone where you drag your finger upwards to zoom in and downwards to zoom out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming and panning is fast enough not to be a burden.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback: troubling Androids since 2008<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed either by clicking the videos shortcut in the image gallery or by launching the dedicated app from the main menu. The video browser is identical to the image gallery and the player is pretty much standard Android stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is pretty bad news as video playback is probably the weakest point in the otherwise multimedia-friendly Android OS. The poor codec support maxes out at H.264 so DivX and XviD videos need to be converted for playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is decent but the interface is as basic as it gets. You get a scrollable video timeline, fast-forward, rewind and play/pause keys and that?s that. No aspect ratio settings, no subtitle support, no nothing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, if you are willing to live with converting your videos for playback the BACKFLIP might do the trick as it is particularly easy to set the handset on a desk or table with the display facing you. Using half the phone for support beats any kickstand by a comfortable margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player does the job, barely<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Motorola BACKFLIP is hardly affected by the MOTOBLUR UI and this is another piece of bad news as the Android music player is anything but perfect. The core functionality is all there and the looks aren?t half as bad as the video player either, but there is still some catching up to do before it matches the best in class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing user interface, though very sleek and more comfortable doesn't offer too many new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort tracks by artist or album or you can browse them by playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part is the built-in search functionality that allows you to search a specific song title in Google or YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the well known weaknesses like no equalizer presets, and no alternative player skins are still there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the Motorola BACKFLIP doesn't have particularly good audio output to boast about. Its loudness is decent and the frequency response is spot-on and the distortion levels are kept well under control but the noise levels (or otherwise said, the signal-to-noise ratio) and the dynamic range are plain poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The result is higher than usual background noise bringing us back in the days of analogue tapes. Of course the BACKFLIP isn't that bad (the usual signal/noise ratio of a tape is 40 to 50 dB) but it isn't much better either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP comes with a 5 megapixel camera for a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels. A LED flash is also mounted next to the lens to assist low-light performance but its effective range is pretty limited so miracles aren?t to be expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface in Android versions prior to 2.0 is virtually non-existent. Not to mention flash support was only added in Android 2.0. So we gotta give it to Motorola for coming up with their own camera UI for the BACKFLIP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They have added indicators in the viewfinder for the Flash status, chosen resolution and remaining number of shots to memory full. In addition, all icons rotate smoothly when you tilt the handset from landscape to portrait mode and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of customizable settings is still pretty limited though. You get autofocus, image quality, white balance, resolution and color effects. Geotagging finishes this pretty short list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the interface is pretty badly organized so you need to press several keys to access even these few settings. The menu key and then settings, then advanced settings makes up for three different menus to go through or an average of two settings per menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another disadvantage of the Motorola BACKFLIP camera is its viewfinder which has a different aspect ratio than the sensor. That means a part of the frame isn?t displayed, which makes proper framing a pretty hard task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the image quality of the Motorola BACKFLIP isn?t that impressive either. Poor white balance with cold unrealistic colors and all too aggressive noise reduction take their toll on image quality. All fine detail is eradicated and replaced with color blobs to give the photos a distinct oil painting look. You can check it out in the samples below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Motorola BACKFLIP. You can check out what that test is all about here. Again it?s hardly the best performer we have seen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKLFLIP is even worse in terms of video recording. The phone captures CIF video at 30 fps, which is barely good for anything else than the occasional MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is almost identical to the still camera's. It sports a setting for picking video quality, color effects, autofocus and white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, when set to auto the white balance is way off most of the time leaving you with video that is rarely good for watching on the phone itself, let alone on a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola BACKFLIP camera video sample</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good all-round connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its smartphone nature, the Motorola BACKFLIP offers excellent connectivity. The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE ensure worldwide roaming capabilities while the quad-band 3G (850/1900/2100 MHz) comes with 7.2Mbps HSDPA. Of course, we have the Euro variety here, the AT&amp;T version in the US has a 1700MHz support instead of the 1900MHz one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 2.1 as well as USB v2.0 take care of the local connectivity. Bluetooth support is far from being so good though. It's limited to headset use and does not support file transfers. At least the A2DP support is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also make use of the hot-swap microSD card slot by pairing it with a card-reader to get some pretty impressive data transfer speeds. Unfortunately we didn?t find a tethering option in the BACKFLIP menus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Browser lacks Flash, the trackpad isn?t very useful<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android web browser has always been good, although the newer version we?ve seen on Android 2.0 has a better, more intuitive UI. Still, the Motorola BACKFLIP browser renders most pages flawlessly and is very snappy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BACKFLIP doesn?t have pinch zooming, despite its capacitive display, so instead it relies on the +/- zoom buttons and the magnifying glass feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double-tap zooming is missing as well (it was added in Android 2.0).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an additional ?1x? button that resets the zoom at 100% - a quick way to get to a comfortable zoom level for reading. The magnifying glass zooms out until the page fits horizontally on the screen and then gives you a virtual magnifying glass, which you move with your finger. It?s perfect for navigating large, content heavy pages or you could use the find on page feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text reflow is enabled and keeps the columns of text exactly as wide as the screen ? essential for reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP features another way to navigate the page ? by using the trackpad. Its use is limited however ? there isn?t an option for a mouse cursor and kinetic scrolling isn?t enabled for the trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course support for multiple tabs ? hit the Windows button to view a grid of the currently open pages displayed as thumbnails. The thumbnail feature in the bookmarks is missing however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard is quite comfortable to use in browsing ? it duplicates the Android keys so they are easy to reach, it also has the option for keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Menu + F is the shortcut for find on page), which also speeds things up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically, Flash support is missing from the browser, though the YouTube application partially makes up for that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is good, views Office documents<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP comes with a nicely stocked organizer and that includes document viewer, which sometimes gets left out on Androids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The document viewer in question is Quickoffice and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and diary. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Diary (A.K.A. agenda view) shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YouTube app has a simple interface that let?s you browse and view videos. It?s an attempt to compensate for the lack of Flash support in the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you somehow end up on the desktop version of the YouTube site, you will be offered to view the video in the YouTube app instead. Of course, Flash on the web is much more than just YouTube, but the YouTube app is better than nothing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation doesn?t do voice-guidance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola BACKFLIP comes with a built-in GPS receiver. It took a couple of minutes to get lock but it did even without A-GPS help. Positioning was quite accurate too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and of course makes an appearance on the Motorola BACKFLIP as well. Its voice-guided navigation version, the Google Maps Navigation is available only in the US, but even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BACKFLIP didn?t have the MOTONAV software that is sometimes preinstalled on Motorola phones. It?s a paid app anyway!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Street View mode is supported in Google Maps and it?s probably the most fun part of Google Maps - it gives you a 360-degree view of the surroundings where it?s available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the digital compass is turned on it feels like you?re taking a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the compass is one of the least sensitive ones we?ve seen ? it takes a while to register rotation and then overshoots because it continues to ?turn? even though you?ve stopped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market offers a lot of alternative SatNav apps for those outside the US, some of them free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has what you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Market on the Motorola BACKFLIP is the older version that came with earlier OS editions. The difference is merely cosmetic, so you?re not losing out much in terms of usability, but keep in mind that some apps require Android 1.6 or higher to run ? those are out of reach for the BACKFLIP at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and below them, four sections (Applications, Games, Search and My downloads).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. News &amp; Weather or Brain &amp; Puzzle, etc.), Search is self explanatory and My downloads keeps track of all the apps you?ve downloaded so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button, type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screen shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from pretty silly (including one that simulates a doorbell) to real must-have's (including file managers, navigation software and more), but that?s true for every other app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We can almost hear some users say thinking out of the box is overrated. We understand that and ? more importantly ? the Motorola BACKFLIP can get over people doubting it. It?s a bold design, eccentric indeed, but it works. The Motorola BACKFLIP will tease you to give it a try. Though obviously not everyone?s cup of tea, it has what it takes to sustain that interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is certainly not the best QWERTY phone in terms of ergonomics but Motorola went creative with the communicator form factor with a certain target audience in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside that unusual body is a first generation Android ? but upgrading to later versions is reportedly on the way. The MOTOBLUR on top is the right thing to give the younger crowd. That is the kind of audience by the way to best appreciate a keyboard folding the other way. Besides, in everyday use the Motorola BACKFLIP is hardly as different as one might imagine at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, is this the best choice for you? Considering proper alternatives is always a wise thing to do, but the unique BACKFLIP concept makes that harder this time around. Let?s check out some of the alternatives to put things in proper perspective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device to come closest to the BACKFLIP is Motorola?s own DEXT MB220. Running on the same OS version and UI, the DEXT is pretty much the same package in a more conventional side-slider form factor. So if the strange fold is all that bothers you here, the DEXT is a definite must consider. You lose the trackpad at the back of the screen but you might save a few bucks too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola DEXT MB220</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those of you with a few extra dollars to spare ? do check out the Motorola MILESTONE. One mean Android, it?s among the best QWERTY communicators. The MOTOBLUR UI won?t be badly missed as long as you are getting a screen so much better and a superior keyboard. Not to mention the latest version of the Android OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola MILESTONE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the LG GW620 is hardly as exciting but a viable alternative for the ones not completely convinced by the Motorola approach to Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG GW620</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There seems to be a near perfect match ? both specs and spirit ? outside the Android realm too. The Nokia N97 mini is going after the same market too but obviously isn?t as willing to experiment. The young Finn has a higher-res resistive screen and better multimedia performance. The BACKFLIP has its unique shape and superior keyboard to boast. In the end, it?s Symbian vs. Android, different ammo, same goal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N97 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, to wrap it up: the Motorola BACKFLIP is good enough and few phones out there are creative enough to match it. You know, it?s a phone that will have you wonder which way is up. But if you?re willing to think different, no way is down.</paragraph>
