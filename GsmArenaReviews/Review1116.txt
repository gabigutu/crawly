			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Earlier this month Motorola announced a trio of RAZR phones in New York, but we knew all along that wasn?t the end of it - both Moto and Intel had sent out invites for a European event in London, promising to take us to the edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the invite came before the announcement of the new RAZR phones, it wasn?t clear what Motorola meant by "edge". But their new edge-to-edge screen design solved that mystery - the RAZR M, for example, is almost the size of an iPhone 5, while packing a bigger 4.3" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big news from today's Motoedge event, however, isn't the compactness of the phone, it's the Intel-made chipset that powers it. Just as ARM chipset have moved into Windows 8, so has Intel's x86 Atoms charged into the smartphone field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Atom processors are already in several Android phones, but none of them comes from a player like Motorola. Moto is one of the biggest smartphone makers with a rich history of innovation, not to mention that they're owned by Google now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Andrew Morley came up on stage and promised the most important device since the original RAZR. Jim Wicks took over and explained that the new device is a product of deep collaboration between Motorola and Intel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And he unveiled the first phone with a 2GHz Intel processor, the Motorola RAZRi. The phone's frame is made with aircraft-grade aluminum, there's Kevlar on the back and the screen is protected by Gorilla glass with water-repellent coating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the screen, it's a 4.3" SuperAMOLED Advanced edge-to-edge display with nearly zero pixel response time. Wicks made a point that they managed to fit a proportionally bigger screen than Apple managed with the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processor that powers the Motorola RAZRi is built on a 32nm process and is the first clocked at 2GHz. Intel has optimized the entire experience, including JavaScript and multitasking. With multithreading, Intel promises their chip outperforms current dual-core processors. The GPU is also built on the 32nm process, so Intel is promising good gaming performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery in the phone has 2000mAh capacity - "40% bigger than the one in the iPhone 4S".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera starts up in under a second and shoots 10 photos in, again, under a second. There's a dedicated shutter key, to make the whole experience quicker and more comfortable. Intel's technology also enhances the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZRi packs NFC connectivity for easy sharing of data and pairing with Bluetooth headsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZRi runs Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich at the moment with Motorola's cool circle widgets. Where permitted by local laws, the RAZRi will come with an unlocked bootloader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZRi will be available in select markets - the UK, France, Germany, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico - from the beginning of October.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The presentation just ended, but we're hoping to get a quick hands-on with the RAZRi, so stay tuned for updates!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola RAZR i hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR i is basically a RAZR M with minor changes and, of course, the 2GHz Intel processor inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto is playing to its strengths with the RAZR i, the build quality feels very solid thanks to the aluminum frame that goes around the screen and the familiar, grippy Kevlar coating on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone measures 8.3mm thick but Moto worked its magic and managed to fit a beefy 2000mAh battery inside. It should provide plenty of juice for the Atom CPU to run on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front features a 4.3" SuperAMOLED Advanced edge-to-edge display with qHD (540 x 960) resolution), with Gorilla glass protecting it. It's not the sharpest display, but it is decently bright, with good image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though Motorola calls this an "edge-to-edge" display, there's actually some bezel here - it's just that it's way thinner than that of other smartphones. This also explains how Motorola managed to fit a 4.3" screen on a body that's hardly any bigger than the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the changes that Motorola and Intel made compared to the RAZR M is the hardware shutter key. It's a two-stage key and can be used to launch the camera - it starts up lighting quick!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Intel chipset manages to snap 10 photos in under a second. Other than that, the camera has an 8MP sensor and can shoot 1080p video. It's accompanied by a single-LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key shares the right side of the phone with the traditional Power/Lock key and the volume rocker. On the left, there's a plastic flap that covers the microSIM and microSD card slots and a microUSB port. There's no microHDMI port this time, unfortunately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone houses just the 3.5mm audio jack while the bottom holds nothing of much interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the software, the Motorola RAZR i will be launching with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich in a month, but there's Jelly Bean in its future too (Intel has already ported it to the x86 architecture).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processor is a single-core Atom clocked at 2GHz with Hyper-threading (a technology that improves multithreaded performance even with a single CPU core). Performance seems great but we were curious to see how it performs against the dual-core Krait processor inside the RAZR M - you can find that out on the next page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>App compatibility is another issue - neither Intel nor Motorola spoke too much about it, but you can bet most apps will work okay. Only apps that were developed with the NDK might pose a problem (this compiles the code to the processor's native instructions, but usually that means ARM and not x86 as Intel is a bit late to the party).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Intel has managed to become the mobile chipset vendor to hit 2GHz with its latest Atom chipset. The frequency is impressive indeed and Intel even went on to say that it's not coming at the expense of power consumption. The chipset is built on a 32nm process, so maybe there's some truth to that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Testing the 2GHz Atom</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For usability, it's pretty good. The Motorola Razr i XT890 is quite responsive and it performs very well when it comes to web browsing, switching between apps, even if there's something going on in the background (e.g. an app being installed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processor doesn't benchmark too well though, even with the clock speed increase. Single-threaded performance in Benchmark Pi is nothing spectacular. The Linpack score is pretty good for a single-core processor and Quadrant puts the RAZR i very close to the Atrix HD.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>GPU benchmark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also managed to run a quick NenaMark 2 test. Intel promised that they've increased the GPU speed by moving it to their 32nm process and there is indeed a small speed bump.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's still an old PowerVR SGX540 GPU though, so it doesn't stack up very well against newer designs like Tegra 3's GPU, Mali-400 or the Adreno 225.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browser benchmarks</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript performance, however, is absolutely stunning. It's just about as fast as we've seen a mobile device perform on SunSpider, with only Note II beating it. We suspect the tables will turn when the Motorola RAZR i gets updated to Jelly Bean though (the JB browser is quite a bit faster than the ICS one). Even general browser performance is excellent as BrowserMark shows, the RAZR i lags behind only Samsung's quad-core designs.</paragraph>
