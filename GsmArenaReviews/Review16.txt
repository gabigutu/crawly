		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Affordable touch phones are all over the place so the Samsung S5620 Monte will have to win the old fashioned way ? by giving more and better features. Done deal: with full-suit connectivity, the Monte aims to deliver great touch experience and social networking features plus some distinguishable styling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte has both 3G with HSDPA and Wi-Fi for browsing and data, and a built-in GPS receiver for location services. The Monte has a capable web browser (with Flash support) and a decently sized 3? screen. The GPS can also transform the Monte into a proper SatNav unit thanks to the free NaviExpert app. However, the free license is available for phones sold in the Czech Republic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the impatient readers, here?s a rundown of the Samsung S5620 specs ? the good and bad of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?ve read our preview you?d know the S5620 Monte was orange-on-grey back then. Samsung have obviously changed their mind since and put a tux on the Monte ? it?s now grey on black ? a bit more conservative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preview was written before the Samsung Bada OS came about but now that we?ve played with it too, we can do a better comparison. The Monte is a feature phone and Bada is a smart platform but in the end they both share the TouchWiz DNA. What that means is that the interface of both is pretty similarly ? at least graphically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we have the Samsung S5620 Monte back for a proper check-up. See what has changed and what stayed the same in hardware on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Samsung Monte<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte comes with the three essential items ? a compact charger, a data cable and a one-piece 3.5mm headset. In the box, you?ll find manuals and software too, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Monte has just over 200MB of internal memory, which isn?t really enough if you?d want to put your music collection in there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microSD card will easily expand the storage capacity but you?d need to get your own ? the Monte doesn?t have one bundled in the package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S5620 Monte 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte measures 108.8 x 53.7 x 12.4mm and weighs in at only 92 grams. This makes it just a tad bulkier than the Samsung S8000 Jet but it sits well in the hand thanks to the curved back. It?s easily pocketable and all the controls are comfortable to use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the Samsung S5620 Monte underwent a redesign since the last time we saw it. And those changes have caused some problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a couple of old photos from the preview ? the orange and grey combo and angular design elements did give the Monte an edgy and futuristic feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is how the Monte looks now ? more grown up with its monochrome exterior. The black glossy plastic brings the phone around back to a more classic Samsung look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But here?s the thing ? we liked the edgy look. Suit-and-tie people can look elsewhere for a phone that matches their cufflinks. And let?s face it, the glossy black may be the standard but it?s getting repetitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fingerprints are another unfortunate effect of the glossy plastic. Every finger to have touched the S5620 Monte is clearly and horribly visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, we?re coming off a bit too negative ? the S5620 Monte isn?t the most attractive Samsung touchphone but it beats the S5230 Star. It?s just that the orange accents made the phone much sharper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s enough fashion advice from geeks though. Let?s get back to what we know ? hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is 3 inches in diagonal, which puts it on par with the competition in this price segment, and the resolution is 240 x 400 (WVGA) ? pretty standard but on the low-end for this screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display uses capacitive technology and it?s very sensitive, responding to even a very light touch. Sunlight legibility is a letdown ? finding a proper angle to use the highly reflective display is a tough job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video-call camera is above the screen, left of the speaker grill. There is no proximity or ambient light sensor. The screen brightness must be adjusted manually and during a call the display gets locked by default unless you unlock it with the lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three hardware buttons below the display - Call and End keys obviously and the center button. The center button brings up the main menu or toggles between the active app (if there is one) and the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are flat, almost level with the display and not very big, but they?re comfortable enough to use. The mic pinhole is located further down below the keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the sides of the phone, on the left you?ll find the volume rocker and on the right ? the hardware Lock (or Hold) key and the shutter key. The microSD card slot is also on the right, covered by a plastic flap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Monte has another flap which covers the microUSB port and next to it is the 3.5mm audio jack. The phone charges off the microUSB port. The bottom is bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Samsung S5620 Monte holds the usual: camera lens, loudspeaker and the Samsung logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is a 3MP unit and its round frame protrudes from the back. This makes the phone wobbly on a level surface and exposes the camera to quite a few scratching opportunities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a slight bulge just above the loudspeaker grill, which keeps it from getting muffled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover you'll find a 1000 mAh battery and the SIM compartment. It is on the left side of the device and is level with the shutter key on the opposite end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte has a curved back which makes it comfortable to hold in hand and the weight of only 92 grams makes it surprisingly light for its size. The four corners of the screen are easily reachable and so are the hardware buttons.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface goes TouchWiz 2.0 Plus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung may have a new favorite amongst the OSes but the TouchWiz feature phones have not been forgotten. In fact, Bada and TouchWiz share a lot of DNA, so we?re sure to see many similarities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte runs TouchWiz 2.0 Plus ? it?s much like the older TouchWiz interfaces but with many Bada touches to it. The Plus moniker notes the several updates the UI got since the initial release of version 2.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the TouchWiz 2.0 Plus will feel comfortably familiar to old Samsung users, but it?s intuitive enough to welcome new users too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bada OS has the obvious advantage of being able to run third party apps, but the Samsung S5620 Monte comes with a rich app package and there is of course support for Java, so you can install games and even apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz homescreen is widget-based and you can put as many of them as you can fit ? but you only get three homescreens and you can?t add more (unlike under Bada OS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Widget button lets you pull out more widgets (or put some away). The tray with widgets is at the bottom but works the same way as it did before. On the same line as the button are the three circled numbers, which indicate the currently active homescreen pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case some of you have missed it, widgets are nifty mini-apps that reside on your home screen. Some of them seem to have more purpose, such as the calendar and world clock, image gallery or the mp3/radio players, while others range from fun to pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using More Widgets you can download new ones ? unfortunately there are currently only 14 widgets available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu stretches over several different screens (up to ten), which are sweep-scrollable sideways. All apps (aside from the installed Java apps) are accessible from this menu, so you won?t have to dig through several levels of submenus frequently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A strange omission from the Samsung S5620 Monte is the lack of proper Task management. The phone can still multitask, but switching between apps is impossible. This unfortunately means that you have to go back to the shortcut for the app to switch back to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When minimizing Java apps you can choose to suspend the app (which stops it from working until you get back to it), or you can let it work in the background (which may incur data charges).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Task manager is not completely gone ? but it only shows up when the phone runs out of memory and needs you to close an app before you continue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5620 Monte features the well-known Smart unlock feature, which uses letters to unlock the phone and even start an application automatically after the unlock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Etiquette pause feature is also present ? that?s just another name for ?turn to mute?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte with its TouchWiz interface is mostly hang-free but there are occasional lags in the image gallery when browsing 3MP images and in the browser with heavy pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, a relatively common problem we encountered was the ?Out of memory? error. It happened on heavy web pages (especially when Flash was involved) and when we tried opening our test PowerPoint file.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte is excellent at its main job - making calls - we experienced no reception or voice quality drops for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to say about the dialer. You dial just like you would on any touch phone. There are three virtual buttons - phonebook, more and backspace. Of course you have the hardware call buttons too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S5620 Monte supports smart dialing ? type in the first few digits of the number and a suggested contact will pop up. To search by gradual typing of names, you can use the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo Contacts widget is a fun way to browse your favorite contacts ? it uses a fake 3D environment and shows up to 8 contact pictures in an arc. ou can scroll them up and down and dial the one you want. It's a gimmicky interface, and we don?t think it will be practical in everyday use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5620 Monte also comes with a pretty extensive Log application, which tracks anything from calls, data traffic (mobile Internet only, Wi-Fi traffic is not included), messages sent, call durations and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for loudspeaker performance, the S5620 Monte scored a very good mark. Here it is alongside some of the other devices we have tested. You can find more details about the test itself as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung S5620 Monte has it all. Up to 2000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. It can display the names on the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once and move and copy contacts between both. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name or via the alphabet scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One annoying thing about searching for contacts by gradual typing is that it doesn?t support text prediction ? that is if you try to type ?DE? to search for Dexter, you?d have to tap the 3 key, wait a little and tap it again. Two quick consecutive taps won?t do: you?ll get ?E?, unlike typical smart dialing, which works in a similar manner to T9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While viewing a contact, tapping the button next to each phone number brings up a pop-up with three buttons ? regular call, video call and Send Message. The Call button in the contact list does only voice calls however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add a number of different fields for each contact - up to 5 numbers, 4 email addresses, URLs, notes and so on. You can also assign individual ringtones for both calls and messages, a photo or video for Caller ID, even choose one of five vibrations for incoming calls from that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy feature, if you?ll pardon the pun, is the ability to switch between left and right handed modes. This switches the position of the alphabet scroll only, the Call button next to each contact always stays on the right.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging does the job, but needs QWERTY<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might expect, the Samsung S5620 Monte handles all common message types. The handset has a shared editor for SMS and MMS and a separate one for emails. You can activate delivery reports to receive notifications when the messages have reached the addressee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native email client does not have an option for automatic settings retrieval so we had to enter them manually, but once that's done, emailing is a breeze. The email client also supports push messaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The attachment limit for sending is 5MB, which is enough for most file types. If you receive an office document as an attachment, you will be able to view it as well thanks to the integrated office document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to text input options, the Monte was a disappointment. There are none ? just the virtual 12-key multitap keypad. There is no landscape QWERTY keyboard available, even though the screen is 3 inches big (there is a landscape multitap keypad for what it?s good for).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fast file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S5620 Monte?s file browser can display the files and folders in the phone memory or the memory card, and both at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for different types of files (images, video, sounds), which work as collections of all files of that type. You are not forced to follow this structure though - you can place your files wherever you want and the phone will have no problems handling them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (except the root folders, like Images, Sounds and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth, one by one again, or in bulk. Throughout the whole file manager you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading the memory card is quick and won't bother users. Listing the thumbnails of pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card is quite fast too. The initialization speed of the memory card is surprisingly fast: regardless of the capacity, the S5620 Monte recognizes a 16GB microSD card full of thousands of different files in about 10 seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Gallery is built into the file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S5620 Monte gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and launching it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep your fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list. Browsing the images is really fast and responsive but zooming can take a second on 3MP images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the one-finger zoom but it kicks in after you spend a couple of seconds touching the image with your thumb. Once it?s activated, it starts zooming in before you?ve even moved your finger, which is annoying if you?re trying to zoom out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing images in landscape mode is also available and the rotation is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery can do slideshows too, but they are not customizable and scroll through a bit too fast.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player rocks with DNSe<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard 3.5 mm audio jack and the microSD card slot, the S5620 music functionality is complemented by the great music player usually found on Samsung devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art takes the entire top half of the music player with the basic controls underneath it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the album art overlays additional controls - the progress indicator, a button to change the repeat mode, a shuffle button and an equalizer preset button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5620 Monte equalizer offers the standard presets like pop, jazz, classic, as well as widening, dynamic and surround effects. You can?t create custom equalizers, but with such a wide selection of presets you really won?t need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The DNSe sound enhancing technology offers Externalization, Music clarity, Bass enhancement, Mega bass, Wide and Concert hall presets for an even better sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find music service is a tap away and can be used to identify music playing from somewhere else, e.g. at the café, by sampling about 10 seconds from it and looking it up on web servers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Radio finds music, records it too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte features an FM radio with RDS. The radio app works with Find Music too, which is great if you missed the name of the song playing on the radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an option to record radio broadcasts as well, which can be a cheapo way to get individual tracks or whole song sets off the radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FM broadcast records are in the MP3 format, 192Kbps 32KHz for High quality (that results in about a megabyte for each recorded minute). You can also pause the recording if you want to skip the commercials for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s the radio widget too, which gives you control over the radio from the homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio output of the Samsung S5620 Monte is generally pleasing save for a couple of minor flaws. The stereo crosstalk reading in our traditional test came up pretty mediocre, suggesting some leakage between the two channels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our other grudge is the cut-off extreme bass frequencies, but the Monte frequency response is excellent for the rest of the range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level and dynamic range readings are impressive and the distortion levels are also kept well under control. The volume levels are also pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves how the Monte compares to its competition. You can find more info about the testing procedure and more results here.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player goes up to QVGA only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a simple interface with not too many features. All the basic are covered though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports MP4 videos (so, no DivX and such) but we only managed to get QVGA samples running. The VGA resolution videos we tried were a no go, even CIF (352 x 288 pixels) failed to play.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Bare-bone 3MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte is equipped with a 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera that can take photos with a maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. The hardware is pretty bare-bones - all you get is the camera, no flash or lens protection, nothing besides the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's good that the camera still has a number of nice built-in features like smile shot, preset scenes, viewfinder gridlines, geotagging and panorama mode. Geotagging is one of the features that put the S5620 ahead of other similarly priced touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized - it's almost the same interface as on the Samsung Jet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a 3MP snapper, the camera on the Samsung S5620 is actually pretty good. The photos have low contrast, which makes them seem a bit dull, but at least there?s no blowout. Noise levels are low but the traces of noise reduction are visible in the smudged details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos turn out with slightly oversaturated colors, but this is common as most consumers prefer it this way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung S5620 Monte. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte offers video recording too, but it's nothing to get excited about - it can only manage QVGA at 15fps. We wouldn?t use it for anything other than MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now here's a sample if you want to check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S5620 Monte video sample, QVGA@15fps</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet connectivity is great with 3G and Wi-Fi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte has quad-band GSM support so it?s usable worldwide and it also packs 3G support at the 900/2100 bands. There?s 3.6Mbps HSDPA support for faster downloads. For data-intensive tasks you also have the option to go through Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi manager is the standard Samsung one and will do the job perfectly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is available and it is complete with A2DP support. The microUSB port for syncing and data transfers is also on board and it can charge the phone off a computer. In mass storage mode, you can access the memory card but not to the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a 3.5 mm audio jack for the audiophiles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser let down by RAM shortage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte, like other Samsung feature phones, has the new WebKit-based Dolfin web browser. With Flash support and one-finger zooming, it is one of the better web browsers we have seen on a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dolfin browser also supports double tap for zooming to a specific part of the page and zooming back out. The browser also offers kinetic scrolling and fullscreen view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual zooming is slow ? it takes a couple of seconds to redraw the content when zooming in, but the panning and scrolling are fairly smooth (only longer pans lag a bit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flash support extends to include full featured YouTube videos but the Monte fails to make full use of those. It either has insufficient system memory or its memory management lets it down. We didn?t manage to play a video on YouTube, not even on other video sharing sites. Flash games also failed to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On DailyMotion, for example, the browser kept throwing ?Memory full? errors each time we tried to zoom in, even after a fresh restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this makes the browser very frustrating to use on content-heavy pages, but when the browser works - it?s great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, May 17: Some of our readers report that the browser works fine with YouTube, so the issues could be unit-specific. However, we've seen other reports on the Internet, which match our problematic experience with the Monte browser, so the issues are not limited to a single unit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social networking apps and widgets, but no phonebook integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S5620 Monte comes with social integration in the shape of four neat homescreen widgets - MySpace, Facebook, Twitter and Bebo, and MySpace and Facebook get dedicated apps as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four widgets have similar interface - a big update button at the top, a text field for your current mood/status message and some buttons at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the MySpace widget, the available options include checking your messages, getting into chat and adding friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook widget offers checking your messages, adding new friends and its last option is poking a friend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Twitter widget has only two virtual keys - friends and followers. The Settings button is available everywhere offering options for auto-refresh and adding a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see, the widgets aren't exactly full of features, but the basics are covered. For more features, MySpace and Facebook have dedicated apps you can use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook app shows your newsfeed, the wall and photos for you and your friends, messages, notifications and requests ? basically it supports it all. It can compose new messages too and upload photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Samsung Lindy, the widgets can use Internet over Wi-Fi, so you don?t need to worry about extra data charges. The MySpace and Facebook apps refuse to work in offline mode for some reason, while the widgets don?t have such requirements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Communities application gets you links to websites such as Facebook, YouTube, Picasa, Flickr, Photobucket and more where you can upload photos and videos. You can also preset your login details so you don't have to enter them each time. You can set it up to automatically resize photos and even schedule updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That pretty much covers what Samsung have been doing in the social networking department. Unfortunately, there's no phonebook integration such as in the HTC Sense UI on the Desire and the HD2 or the MOTOBLUR UI on the Motorola BACKFLIP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the controls available on the Samsung Monte allow you to chat, update your status, post tweets, upload photos and read your friends' new posts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte has a number of useful time-management applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. You can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday. You can set two types of events ? Schedule and Anniversary ? and you can set the starting date and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm is quite customizable. You can set up to 10 alarms, each with the following configurable options - custom ringtone, volume, repetition days and name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator of the Samsung S5620 is very basic. Among the other organizer offerings are a voice recorder, a world time application and a unit converter. The voice recorder limit is set to 60 minutes. A countdown timer and a stopwatch also come in useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also to-do and memo applications for jotting down tasks and notes. You can also use the memo widget to place a memo on the homescreen where you're unlikely to forget it. The widget and the application are separate so don't expect your memos to automatically pop up on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5620 Monte comes with a Dictionary app, which gives the definition of English words in English and can save words in the ?My Vocabulary? list. It?s a great tool for non-native speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte comes with an office document viewer that supports Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files. It's an application developed by Access and is one of the nicest additions to the software package. It supports Office 2007 files and one finger zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The document viewer is quick enough when opening files and panning is quite fast. However when we tried to open our PowerPoint test file, the phone spit out an error saying that there?s not enough memory and the file may be truncated.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Exchange ActiveSync support is also present, which should appeal to corporate users. There?s even a handy widget, which lets you sync, compose new email, check mail and toggle push messaging. It can be minimized so it doesn?t take much space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte comes with the Palringo instant messenger preinstalled. It supports various protocols ? G-Talk, ICQ, AIM and MSN. It can handle multiple chats at once and has the option to share your location. Registration is easy and adding new services is pain-free as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s Google Maps, which has all the usual features, but it can?t help you if you?re looking for voice-guided navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is where the NaviExpert 5.3 application comes in. It uses NAVTEQ maps that cover 36 European countries and it requires an Internet connection to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between 2D and 3D map view and there?s traffic information, a POI data base, speed camera warnings even an option to avoid sections that have been temporarily closed off and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NaviExpert app either comes preinstalled on the phone or you can download it ? however, this is for Czech users only for now. If you?ve bought an S5620 Monte from an authorized dealer, you get a free navigation license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hope that the availability of NaviExpert is extended to other regions as well, but we?ve seen nothing official on that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5620 Monte got a satellite lock in under two minutes and has a very handy tool to download A-GPS data (you can set it up to do that manually), which ensures even faster GPS locks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like Samsung Star, the Samsung S5620 Monte didn?t come with any games preinstalled (not even trials), so you?ll have to look for third party games for entertainment. This is likely a regional thing, so your Monte might come with games (as some of our readers report), but there's no guarantee - check before buying it, if you want to make sure.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you ask Samsung about the future of mobile phones, they?ll say smartphones. Their Bada OS is flying the ?smartphone for everyone? flag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the market still has quite a way to go till we get there. Right now, feature phones like the Samsung S5620 Monte are advanced enough to blur the line between smart and feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5620 Monte can multitask (though task switching is problematic), it can view office documents, there?s a very good web browser and free navigation This pretty much covers most of what a smartphone will do for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte offers a compelling package for its price, but it?s getting tough competition from higher end handsets as they?re moving down the ladder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KM900 Arena costs more, but it comes with 8GB of built-in storage, which levels off the price difference. And its screen has four times the number of screen pixels. Then, there?s the better camera ? 5MP, LED flash, D1@30fps video, and goodies like DivX support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could probably get a good deal on LG KC910i Renoir or the non-i version too ? they?re getting old now, but 8MP cameras are quite compelling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KM900 Arena ? LG KC910i Renoir ? Samsung I7500 Galaxy ? Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As smartphones are getting older, they?re moving into this price range too. Take the Samsung I7500 Galaxy, for example ? it?s got Android v1.5 (old but still), an AMOLED screen, a 5MP camera. It costs a bit more, but the 8GB storage offsets that again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another smartphone alternative is the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic ? priced right, rich retail package (including an 8GB microSD card), 16:9 nHD screen and free voice-guided navigation available worldwide with no data connection required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That sure is a lot of competition, but it?s mostly from handsets that are getting old, which has its downsides (like lower resale value, tendency to get fewer firmware updates, etc.). However, quite a few of the Samsung S5620 Monte attractive features are let down by software (Flash support that never works and poor app switching in the task manager).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, catching up with smartphones is easier said than done. On a second thought, the S5620 Monte will get away with some faults exactly because it isn?t a smartphone. It?s obvious that it has enough to entice upgraders coming from the likes of Samsung Star or the Corby bunch. Cheap smartphones are a major threat though.</paragraph>
