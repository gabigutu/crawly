			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia seem to have the missing link in the evolution of mobile phones. The Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type is an attempt to bring the best of both worlds. A touch phone in a form factor that?s as classic as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like it or not, touchscreen phones are the future and it would be a smart move to get ready for the switch. It?s up to you really. You can choose while there still is choice. Or you can simply wait for the inevitable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But you know what, you can be as uncertain and old-fashioned and backward about touchscreen as you like. And still be prepared. The transition doesn?t have to be painful says Nokia with their C3-01 Touch and Type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And as we found out reviewing the Nokia X3-02, the touchscreen/numpad combo worked impressively well on a slim metallic body. Little wonder then, Nokia are going for the same thing with the C3-01 Touch and Type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 starts from roughly the same spot as its X3-02 sibling. And obviously, it isn?t going anywhere more exciting or advanced. This kind of phones have their limitations and they?re more than obvious. S40 handsets have been getting a lot of stick (at least from us) for the lack of even basic multitasking, smart dialing and a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But still, we did like the touch and type concept ? more for the look and feel and less for the features. The C3-01 will have to live up to a very high standard of build quality and design to boost its chances of survival. It certainly helps though to have a true classic and a massive bestseller as an inspiration. The Nokia 6300 belongs to different times but its timeless charm is all over the C3-01.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type package is nothing to write home about. We didn?t expect much better in this price range, but a microSD card to ensure adequate storage right out of the box would have been nice.Otherwise, there?s only room for sixteen five-megapixel shots on the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also no microUSB cable included, so unless you have one at hand Bluetooth is your only option for connecting the C3-01 to your computer. All you get here is a nicely looking white hands-free set and a charger.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 stretches to 111 x 47.5 x 11 mm and has a volume of 51.4 cc. That does sound bigger than the Nokia X3-02 with its 45.3 cc but the C3-01 is still one pretty compact phone. Unless you have the two of them side by side you won?t notice the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in weight is more pronounced though ? 100 g vs 77.4 g. We for one like the solid feel of the added heft.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If there?s a single form factor where the Nokia designers are certainly a cut above the rest, it would certainly be slim and classic candybars. The C3-01 Touch and Type is marvelous to look at with its sleek curved lines and metallic back. We got the silver one for review, though the other versions look quite appealing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can clearly see the 6700 classic (which we still find to be one of the most attractive phones ever) genes in the C3-01. The good news is that the introduction of touchscreen and larger display hasn?t done any harm to the overall look. If anything, the C3-01 Touch and Type looks better than the 6700 classic and different enough so it doesn?t get boring.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start the hardware inspection with the Nokia C3-01 2.4" resistive touchscreen. Taking up the upper half of the front panel the LCD screen sports QVGA resolution and is capable of showing up to 256K colors. As you could imagine with specs like that the image quality is hardly something to write home about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness is good but contrast is mediocre at best. We are actually not sure if talking about depth of black is appropriate here ? grey is more like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite employing the resistive technology the C3-01 Touch and Type touchscreen is sensitive enough not to be bothering. Despite coming from a series of capacitive units we had very little trouble adapting to it. Plus resistive seems like a bit better match for a transition device like it (you can always employ the help of a stylus). This is also the reason we don?t object much to the relatively small display size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final thing we?d like to note about the touchscreen is its haptic feedback, which is Nokia?s specialty in this department. Wherever you tap on the display, you?ll feel the vibration right under your finger, unlike most competitors, where vibration seems to come from the same spot regardless of where you click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve been wondering for a while now how Nokia manages to create the illusion of the vibration feedback changing its place depending where you touch the phone but we still haven?t found the answer. Not that it really matters ? what matters is the real usability bonus that this feature adds. The vibration touch feedback of the Touch and Type series is a real treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the C3-01 display of the C3-01 we found the ambient light sensor and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display we find a silver-colored line hosting the two call handling keys. The number has been reduced since the X3-02 (music and messaging keys are gone) and that has allowed Nokia to reduce the size of this bar and free up more space for the multitap keyboard below. Since those two keys are elevated this shrinking hasn?t affected their usability too much and they are still easy to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type packs a 12-key alphanumeric keypad with a standard layout as opposed to the odd layout on the X3-02. You are getting four rows with three icons each, rather than three rows with four buttons a piece. This means that the asterisk, hash key and the zero button are exactly where you expect them to be and you don?t need to get used to a new layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys are large enough and provide decent tactile feedback so the achievable typing speed isn?t bad at all. Still we have to admit we preferred the terraced layout of the X3-02 on this one. Nonetheless if you master the T9 input you?ll be doing just fine with the C3-01 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece is located on the left side of the keyboard, which leaves the bottom of the handset completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left hand side of the Nokia C3-01 is completely bereft of functional elements too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side one finds the screen lock key, the volume rocker and the the dedicated camera button. Strangely enough, there is a portion of the camera key that isn?t actually pressable and doesn?t seem to have any purpose. It might make it easier for you locate the key by touch, but then again so would have had a larger button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Nokia C3-01 features the microUSB port, the 3.5mm audio jack and the Nokia proprietary charger plug in that order. There is no protective cover over any of the apertures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You?d be happy to know that USB charging and even USB-on-the-go are supported (though you do need a special cable for that). USB charging is not available on all Nokia phones, so we?re glad to see it this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few things of interest at the back. The loudspeaker is here and so is the LED flash but undoubtedly the star is the 5 megapixel camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although fixed-focus, there are still some high expectations about this one ? after the 6700 classic did so well in its time. But we?ll see how it fares later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the the steel battery cover sit the SIM bed, the (hot-swappable) microSD card slot and the 1050 mAh BL-45 Li-Ion battery. Despite the increased capacity its rated endurance is hardly much better than that of the X3-02. It goes 5 hours 30 minutes of talk time and 405 hours of stand-by on 3G networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its real-life performance stands at about three days of moderate usage (30 minutes of telephony, 20 minutes of browsing over Wi-Fi per day and snapping the occasional photo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end of the hardware part we are pleased to conclude that the build quality of the Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type is perhaps even better than that of the X3-02. If nothing else, the thicker metal back panel makes it look even more solid. As Touch and Type is trying to blend technology and tradition, it makes sense to give users a choice between classic (C3-01) and contemporary (X3-02).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now off to the software part of our review. Join us after the break.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S40 is getting there?slowly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 runs the Series 40 6th edition software ? we?re returning to a familiar environment and if you already met the X3-02 Touch and Type you should know pretty much everything there is to know about it. The few things that are different from the regular non-touch S40 are the thumb-optimized icons and system fonts. Other than that, it is almost the same as any other S40 handset out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Nokia C3-01 user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vast reach of Nokia means that many people have at some point used an S40 device. But old glory aside, S40 still has important features missing and things that need polishing ? even in the touch edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, familiarity is not a bad thing. Plus, the UI is simple and fairly intuitive so you can get going right away, you don?t need any special help or instructions to use the Nokia C3-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode (or Home screen mode, as Nokia call it here) is available as usual. It divides the screen into four sections that can be edited as users see fit (by tap and hold on any section). By default, the clock is on top, followed by Favorite contacts, then Music player and radio and the Shortcut bar at the bottom, which grants instant access to four favorite functions or apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can customize that ? rearrange things and add or replace shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A brand new feature on S40 Touch Edition is the lockscreen. It?s pretty standard ? a clock and tap-to-unlock key. A handy function is that pressing the end key while the keypad is locked, brings up a clock that shows the time and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has only two views ? Grid and List. The grid layout is handy for offering numpad shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking support is still missing on S40.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no D-pad on the Nokia C3-01 but the soft keys are there. Only virtual this time ? they?re at the bottom of the screen, and there?s a virtual Menu key between them. The soft keys are user-configurable ? you can assign a shortcut of choice to each of them. We do think though, at least one of them is best left with Go To. It?s the kind of quick menu we?ve seen on many S40 handsets but touchscreen makes so much difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the C3-01 you get a 3 x 3 grid of virtual buttons serving as shortcuts to frequently used functions or apps. It?s a quick launcher of sorts that makes a lot of sense. The whole thing is fully customizable ? you can set a shortcut to virtually any item in the interface. And it makes sure you don?t repeat an item that?s already in the grid. Nicely done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing to note as missing is an accelerometer. Unlike some of its S40 non-touch siblings, the Nokia C3-01 leaves out features like tap-for-time and turn-to-mute. As for screen auto rotation, it?s not badly missed we think, given the screen size. Some might still find it a nuisance though ? having to manually set display orientation where it matters: in the camera viewfinder, image gallery and the video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia C3-01 runs the same software as the X3-02, but you may notice that some of the phones (perhaps it depends on the region) are set on different themes. Besides the dark color theme, such as the one on the screenshots, there is the standard blue theme typical for most of the S60 devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>A familiar phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia C3-01 will store about 2000 contacts depending on the fields you use, which isn?t as good as unlimited storage but should do for 99% of the users out there. You can set the phonebook to display contacts from the phone memory, SIM memory or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a contact is simple and straightforward ? the phone asks for number, first and last name and that?s it. When you need to add other details you can always go back and edit the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names, eliminating problems, which may occur with synchronization. You can assign ringtones to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts display as a list of names with thumbs. There?s kinetic scrolling but isn?t nearly as fluid as on some of the more recent S60 touch phones. When a contact is selected shortcuts are available to make a call, send text, view conversations, etc. You can view the contact?s details or add new ones too. Tapping and holding on a contact reveals extra options such as Edit, Delete, Move or Copy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The reception on the Nokia C3-01 was consistently good and in-call sound was crisp and clear. The lack of smart dialing was not surprising for an S40 device. There?s no voice dialing either, nor the Voice Clarity sound enhancement feature many other S40 phones have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out the Nokia C3-01 is a Good performer. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here..</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is certainly up to the task. The Nokia C3-01 is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS, as well as flash and audio messages and there?s easy email setup, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard on the C3-01 is up to the task and will please the heavy texters out there. This time Nokia chose the classic layout, so you want need extra time to adjust. Conversations view mode is here too (that?s the threaded message feature) and in fact Conversations replaces the regular Inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor is well organized and you won?t spend too much time finding your way around. Nokia has added four new virtual controls due to the lack of D-pad ? two arrow keys, letter case switch and symbols. Of course you can tap to move the cursor wherever you want, but you?ll still need those two arrows for precise positioning. The symbol and letter case features are also available from the numpad, so there is no real need of them on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing the message there?s a character counter and message part counter available and when you?re done you pick the recipient from the contacts list, the recently used numbers, the call log or contact groups. You can have a favorite contact too (just one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, you can enter the number manually if it?s not on any of those lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client does pretty well to meet most user needs. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up the email client was extremely easy. It just required an email address and entering and confirming the password ? the Nokia C3-01 took care of the rest.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The better gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S40 Gallery app was trying to be too many things at once and being a photo gallery wasn?t among its strong points. Now, there?s a separate icon in the main menu ? Photos, which serves the one and only purpose of viewing the photos and videos on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality is pretty much the same, but at least the Photo gallery gets rid of the cruft of file managing features and leaves only the image-related stuff in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app on the Nokia C3-01 offers only a single viewing mode, displaying a grid of 12 pictures on the screen. You can switch to landscape mode from the menu though ? it makes better use of the screen real estate when you open a photo (there are black bars in portrait mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s flick scrolling and it?s fluid enough. It?s only you can see the phone struggle with the slide animation at times ? much like it does with any other scrolling item throughout the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in on a picture is only possible with the onscreen zoom shortcuts. At least, it?s fast and relatively smooth, even for 5MP images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize photos into albums, view them in a timeline (they are ordered by the date they were taken) and of course you can start a slide show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the regular Gallery app, it?s still here ? but it?s hidden in the Applications menu. It?s quite a capable file manager, especially for a feature phone. It can manage folders and files ? both one by one and in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Nokia C3-01 has decent looks and a solid set of features. It has great all-round functionality, including album art, and a fair number of formats are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is controlled either via the on-screen interface or the shortcut hardware key just below the display . Songs can be filtered by artist, album and genre. The player handles AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, WMA, AMR-NB. Naturally the A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the artist and title of the currently playing song are shown on the homescreen. They appear in the Radio and music area on the homescreen so they need to be enabled in the Homescreen mode settings for the info to be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also has an equalizer with a few available presets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to the preloaded content on C3-01 is the FM radio. It matches the music player interface and covers all basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS support is available and you can make the handset search and save all available stations in your area. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen, much like with the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering its price, the Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type did greatly in our audio quality test. That's mostly true when used with an active external amplifier, as in those cases the Nokia C3-01 manages to pull off a spectacular performance, getting excellent scores throughout. Everything about its results screams high-end, including the loudness levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is some notable deterioration when headphones are plugged in. Intermodulation distortion falls and frequency response worsens, but the truth is neither of those is too disturbing. The stereo crosstalk on the other hand raises high enough to become notable. It's not the end of the world, but it certainly is an area where the C3-01 loses to its more expensive competitiros.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Limited Xvid support in the video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we expected, the limited XviD support from the X3-02 is back. As usual it managed to play most of the Xvid videos we threw at it (granted, files have to be up to 700MB and of up to nHD resolution). It?s not the best in the class, but it?s way better than we had hoped for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the nHD MP4 files were too much for the new S40 video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the user interface is concerned there are shortcuts for fullscreen mode, fast-forward or rewind and that?s that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The 5 megapixel camera is fixed-focus only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type has a 5 megapixel camera? but there?s no autofocus. The maximum image resolution is 2592x1944 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited. The available options include portrait mode, white balance, various effects and a self timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While impressive as a number, the 5 megapixels of the Nokia C3-01 camera fail to impress. The produced images are the same quality as the X3-02 ones ? lots of noise and way too heavy compression. These two combined seem to bring down the practical resolution of the C3-01 camera below 5MP. There?s also obvious oversharpening and even some purple fringing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, since the camera lacks auto focus, you can scratch macro shots or document scanning out of the possible shooting scanarios.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Outdated video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Things don?t get any better with video recording. The C3-01 manages VGA resolution at 15 fps, but better video recording uses a lot more processing power than the C3-01 can?t afford.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The result is the same as the still images ? low contrast, lack of detail, heavy compression, lots of over sharpening and purple fringing. Some of the videos can be enjoyed we guess but only on the phone?s display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent connectivity for a budget phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 offers quad-band GSM and UMTS support. There is also HSPA support, download speed potentially reaching 10.2 Mbps, and up speed as good as 2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is version 2.1 and A2DP is of course enabled. The Nokia C3-01 uses a microUSB port for both data connections and charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger treat though is USB On-the-go. The Nokia C3-01 can access USB flash drives and even other phones. Of all the USB flash drives we tested, the C3-01 only failed with one (card readers don?t work either). Non-Nokia-made handsets generally refused to share their memory too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you happened to connect two USB on-the-go devices ? it depends on which end the USB on-the-go cable is your ?browsing? device to understand which opens which. By the way, a special USB-OTG-enabled cable like the one that came with the Nokia N8, is not included in the C3-01 Touch and Type?s box. You?ll have to buy one separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the C3-01 successfully browsed the N8?s memory drive but, when we turned the connection the other way around, something odd happened. Both devices started flashing ?Device not supported? warnings. So, your mileage may vary when using USB on-the-go to connect to other phones (both S40 and Symbian devices worked).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi connectivity is also at hand. In fact, the Wi-Fi is one of the key features of the Nokia C3-01 ? it is one of the cheaper Wi-Fi enabled phones on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type also comes complete with a memory card slot. Coupled with a card reader it can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the standard 3.5mm audio jack, which allows you to use your own headphones, but doesn't have TV-out functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good browser, small screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the internet on the Nokia C3-01 is a pleasant experience. Even the most elaborate pages are rendered well and finding your way around is reasonably comfortable on the touch-enabled display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you might guess the virtual cursor is no more, but there is some familiar touch controls borrowed from Symbian S60 ? the full screen switch and the zoom key. There is kinetic scrolling too, which works well enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated zoom key is the only zooming option ? neither double tap nor the volume rocker works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the Adobe Flash Lite 3.0 support, Nokia C3-01 web browser doesn?t support Flash. If you want to watch some YouTube stuff you?ll have to rely on the mobile version of the website. Anyway, the lack of Flash is not a big deal, especially for that small screen and the hardware specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most other S40 phones, the Nokia C3-01 has the Opera Mini 5 browser preinstalled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer on the Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type is well stocked as usual and things have been touch optimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar starts off with the month view ? when you press and hold, a bigger number will pop up just above your finger so you can aim easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an event on that date, the event description will pop up instead (it?s not visible otherwise, just like on the old S40 version).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Day view is also available, but strangely, week view has gone missing. You have various kinds of events available ? reminder, meeting call, birthday, anniversary and memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is brand new too ? the big, touchable numbers make it easy to set and you can make it ring only on specific days. You can customize the snooze time too, but there?s only one alarm available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer. They have been touch optimized as well, though we wish the countdown timer used the same big numbers as the Alarm clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition, a loan calculator is also available. It?s now easier to use as you can directly tap the functions instead of having to scroll and select them with the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C3-01 comes with two converters ? one for general measurements and one for clothes. The first one is excellent ? it has a long list of supported conversions and you can add your own. The Size converter for clothes is essential for shopping abroad but it?s not quite as optimized for the platform. You have to enter a size then tap OK, then tap the result to see the info ? too many taps considering the flexibility a touchscreen offers. Anyway, it?s an application specific issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application offers Google Search or Bing Search initially, though other search engines might be available depending on your country and region. Searching launches the web browser ? you?d probably be better off using the Opera Mini 5 search bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock can tell the time in up to four cities. It offers a long list of cities, but there?s no search (so you have to scroll a lot for, say, Washington) and you can?t just tap on the map either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last preinstalled app is Shazam ? a music recognition service. Unfortunately, you only get a 30-day trial version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps was not preinstalled, but we tried it anyway. It installed just fine, but it expected keyboard controls, which we couldn?t use ? the Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type has neither D-pad nor softkeys. We tried cheating and downloaded the touch version for the Samsung S8000 Jet off getjar.com, but that got us nowhere either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Social networking has been creeping its way into Series 40 for a while, but this is probably the best implementation we?ve seen yet. The key differentiator here between the C3-01 and the C3 (the non-touch one) is the touch screen ? Facebook has so many features that it?s impossible to have a simple interface. Which is where the touch screen comes in ? it makes interactions much simpler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Nokia C3-01 the Communities app is the SNS central. It handles both Facebook and Twitter accounts, including several accounts of each type (though only one Facebook and one Twitter account can be connected at a time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook section supports the full communication capabilities of the site. You can view messages and events, friend requests and event invitations. Write on people?s wall and browse their profiles, post photos (either from the Gallery or you can snap a new one on the spot), post status updates, read news feeds and follow groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Twitter is an inherently simpler service but the app has plenty of features too. You can update your status, check your @mentions, send direct messages and reply to tweets too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One cool thing is the Shorten links button ? Twitter will shorten links automatically, but only after you send the tweet. Shorten links will use bit.ly to shorten links beforehand and give you a few extra characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found two things missing from the Twitter part of the app. The first one was support for retweeting. The other is an option to upload a photo to TwitPic and its likes and have the URL for that photo embedded into the tweet automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S40 doesn?t have multitasking, even in this touch-enabled incarnation, but you can still receive updates even when you exit the Communities app. Put the Communities tab on the homescreen and pick a default account and you?re good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default account is what you see first when you start the app (so if you only have a Facebook account, you don?t have to tap the Facebook tab every time). Also, only the updates from the main account will be visible on the homescreen. You can also set the time to receive new updates ? say, from 8:00 to 22:00.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The renewed Ovi Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ovi Store is evolving ? it got a new user interface for the Symbian^3 version and we?re glad to report that this new interface has been carried over to the touch-enabled Series 40 phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s more user-friendly and it is finally making some serious effort to attract more developers. You can browse the apps available in the Ovi Store by categories ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections ? currently only Go Green is available for S40 with just one app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps track of all the apps you have installed under My stuff. You can now also select where games and apps should be installed and where audio and video should go. That?s nice ? we wish Android had that right from the start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are already plenty of apps and games there, a lot of them free, and chances are that the most important apps will be there soon enough. They are still behind the big players in the app store game, but we?re seeing that the important apps are making their way to the Ovi Store. Other than that, we can live without the 50 thousand book titles and thousands of other questionable ?apps?.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A few games on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type came with three games preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Climate Mission is a series of environmentally-themed puzzles that will take you across the world. At the beginning of each challenge, there?s a small nugget of information. The game is fun and educational.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Picture Puzzle needs no further explanations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final game is Memorize ? it has three variants, which require you to remember an ever growing string of things. This can take the form of a Simon Says type of game or, say, playing notes on a virtual piano keyboard.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The premium looks and excellent build quality are a nice place for the Nokia C3-01 to start. Things are looking good for the whole Touch and Type concept too ? there?s nowhere else to go for a set with both touchscreen and a numpad. This doesn?t mean the Touch and Type phones are free of competition. In fact, they will need to work hard to convince users. Especially those considering a smartphone or a full-touch handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Affordable smartphones and touchscreen feature phones will be the main source of pressure for the Touch and Type lineup. And since affordable smartphones are a Nokia specialty ? the real competition is perhaps limited to the likes of the Corby and the Cookie ? and all the sequels that followed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a very clear distinction though: the Corbies and the Cookies of the world are for the young. The Touch and Type will likely appeal to a more grown-up audience, and more mature tastes. We guess Nokia must?ve been thinking: ?There?s no room for more touchscreen dumbphones. Let?s do something else instead, something we?re good at anyway.?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that?s where S40 makes a lot of sense. The C3-01 is part of a new beginning but tradition is what will draw returning customers. Touch and Type will certainly be hoping to recapture the magic that made the Nokia 6300 and the 6700 classic what they are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touchscreen is only part of the S40 evolution. Handsets like the Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type are trying to give you more bang for your buck. High-speed network data, WLAN and USB-on-the-go are great things to have ? especially considering that S40 is still falling short on other key features such as multitasking and smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But then, there?s more than one way to make up for the failings. It?s not every day that we meet such a perfectly manufactured device. The Nokia C3-01 is made entirely of metal and the gaps between the parts are so tiny, it?s almost a unibody. The phone is hard to resist and you?ll know it the moment you open the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for competition, there?s no point looking for rivals that fit the Touch and Type description. The likes of the Sony Ericsson Aino and the LG KF750 Secret are hardly relevant here. The meaningful competition is somewhere between entry level smartphones and touch and non-touch dumbphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia X3-02 is the first and obvious competitor. It packs exactly the same specs, but offers different colors and unique redesigned keypad. There are dedicated messaging and media keys too, but the battery is not as capable as the C3-01 one. Oh, and it?s ?10 cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia X3-02 Touch and Type</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The candybars Sony Ericsson Elm and Nokia 6700 classic are worth your thought too. Both of them are feature phones with small displays, and both have great 5-megapixel autofocus snappers. There's plenty of metal used on both of them too. Unfortunately the classic Finn lacks WLAN support but makes up for it with free navigation with Nokia Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Elm ? Nokia 6700 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may also want to check the smarty Nokia C5 running on Symbian S60. It has a few drawbacks - the lack of Wi-Fi and the poor camera - but looks classy and resembles the classic Nokia design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few smartphones that also worth mentioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original LG GT540 Optimus and the recently released Optimus One P500 run on the Android Eclair and Android Froyo respectively. Both pack everything that the today?s smartphone requires and are quite popular in their class. The Optimus is quite cheap today with its ?130 price tag but you?ll have to settle with a resistive touchscreen. On the other hand, the Optimus One bets on the capacitive technology but it will cost you about ?220.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG GT540 Optimus ? LG P500 Optimus One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Nokia camp we find the 5530 XpressMusic, which comes with a bigger, higher-res screen, an auto-focus 3MP camera and 4GB microSD in the box. The Symbian S60-powered Nokia 5530 can be yours for ?160 ? the same as the C3-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5530 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever the competition, Nokia C3-01 Touch and Type has everything to become a best-seller and the price is more than reasonable. We fell in love with its design and build quality, and we certainly hope to see more handsets by Nokia with the same design theme.</paragraph>
