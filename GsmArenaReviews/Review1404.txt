			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It truly is a catchy name, but the Trophy is ? so to speak ? the consolation prize in the HTC Windows Phone 7 lineup. It?s not the big guy in the family nor is it the smartest. The Trophy is a middle-of-the-roader, the mass market choice. It?s the first HTC-made Windows Phone 7 device we?re reviewing and we guess it?s up to them to prove there?s no such thing as an ex PocketPC maker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 is about sky-high hardware standards and Microsoft is not really encouraging out-of-the-box thinking. What does this mean for the HTC 7 Trophy? Well, believe it or not, this here Trophy has come onto the scene to bring the one thing that Windows Phone 7 is obviously short of ? device personality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don?t get us wrong, WP7 is a great looking OS ? and one that will only be getting better in terms of usability ? but Microsoft-imposed uniformity is making it hard for manufacturers to set their products apart. They are trying to make up for that with better screens or free apps, but they still haven?t hit on a winning formula yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy will do its best to be the WP7 phone that stands out from the crowd. Since Microsoft forbids any customization, HTC took a different approach to giving the OS some individuality. Instead of offering free apps from the Marketplace, HTC have built their own ? available to download for free off the HTC Hub. And the hub itself is a pinch of Sense UI sprinkled on Windows Phone 7, with some awesome exclusive apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WP7-specific limitations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 doesn?t have the luxury to break itself in gently to the smartphone arena like the iOS did. Microsoft?s new platform has been released into fierce OS competition with Google and Apple leading the way. Microsoft knows that best and will spare no effort to promote their Windows Phone 7. From funny TV ads and massive billboards, exclusive operator deals and even Xbox Live Arcade, they?re trying to make the biggest marketing impact in as short a time as possible. Not to mention product placement: WP7 phones are displacing iPhones in some of the highly-rated TV shows and recent blockbusters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alright, that?s a new platform that users need to hear about. As for individual devices, it will be up to the manufacturers to tout their strengths. In the case of the Trophy, you just can?t go around promoting a brand new Windows device from the makers of some the best Android phones. Nor can you refer to HTC?s record with Microsoft powered devices. Comparing Windows Phone 7 to PocketPC won?t make sense really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, whether it?s the Trophy ? or any other Windows Phone 7 handset ? you may as well take the premium hardware for granted. It?s Microsoft?s way or the highway and it?s a deal that users are not likely to mind. HTC have kindly added an exclusive software package and stylish looks. Build and finish have always been an HTC forte and that?s where we start, right after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC 7 Trophy unboxed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tiny box of the HTC 7 Trophy has managed to accommodate everything you need to use your phone. There?s a USB charger, a standard microUSB data cable and the usual paperwork. The supplied one-piece headset is not your only option ? the Trophy has a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing missing ? that we?ve got more or less accustomed to ? is a memory card. It?s irrelevant here, as the HTC 7 Trophy does not have a memory card slot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC 7 Trophy 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy stands at 118.5 x 61.5 x 12 mm ? that?s perhaps average for the screen size. But there?s something about the Trophy that makes it look smaller than it actually is. The first time we saw the HTC 7 Trophy in person we thought the LG Optimus 7 ? which has the same size screen ? was going to look like a giant next to it. In all fairness, it doesn?t. It?s just that the Trophy looks friendly and compact. Nicely done, HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Trophy is comfortable to handle and easily pocketable. The weight of 140 grams might be taken to imply some use of metal on the chassis but the phone is in fact all made of plastic. High-quality matt plastic ? we hasten to add ? and it gives an impression of a friendly, yet solidly built, phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy is all black with stylish design, which from the front does look almost seamless. The single accent up front is a super thin metallic frame around the screen ? subtle and elegant. There?re barely any physical controls ? a power/lock key, volume rocker, and the camera shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Trophy uses a soft rubbery plastic at the rear and this is an excellent choice. It gives a great grip and the fingerprints are far less noticeable. Of course cleaning that matte surface is still quite a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touchscreen phones are not the best devices to get creative with design and the Trophy is no exception. HTC made the right choice by going for build quality and durability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Trophy sports a 3.8? capacitive WVGA LCD touchscreen, which looks fine indoors. The display?s colors are deep and vivid and the contrast is good. But if you go outside you can?t help but notice the poor sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for screen sensitivity, the Trophy reacts to the gentlest tap thanks to the capacitive technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will only notice the earpiece. However, there is more: a small status LED and two hidden sensors (proximity and ambient light) either side of the HTC logo. The LED will blink in red or green to indicate charging or missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen we find the typical Windows Phone 7 controls ? Back, Start and Search. They?re all capacitive keys with excellent sensitivity and haptic feedback. Pressing and holding the middle Start key will activate Voice Commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy?s left side features a long and thin volume rocker and the uncovered microUSB port. On the right, there is only the metallic camera key. It has a relatively short stroke but still distinct enough half press and full press. The camera takes less than two seconds to launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the unprotected 3.5mm audio jack and the Screen Lock/Power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing to note at the bottom of the phone is the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy?s rear features the 5 megapixel camera lens and the loudspeaker grill. There is also a small LED flash to boost the camera's low-light performance but don?t expect any miracles in low-light situations..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The material used on the back cover is really nice to touch ? it?s plastic but the surface has a soft rubber-like feel and provides great grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone?s inner body ? including the battery ? is flashy yellow, just like on the HTC Mini and Aria. Under the battery cover, you'll find only the SIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy uses a 1300 mAh battery quoted at up to 3 and a half hours of talk time and up to 435 hours of stand-by time in a 3G network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality is really impressive, you?ve got to hand it to HTC. Most of the Trophy is high quality matte black plastic, but there is some metal too ? on the frame surrounding the display and on the camera?s small plating. The HTC Trophy is quite comfortable to use too ? it has an excellent grip and a pocket-friendly size ? so we have no complaints about the overall design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting on the next page, we're in Windows Phone 7 territory. Hit the jump for the user interface and applications.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>WP7 interface has a lick of Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The software part of Windows Phone 7 reviews feels like a book you?ve read ? that?s because all WP7 phones run the exact same software, with just a couple of preinstalled apps that make some difference. So don?t get surprised that we?ve reused some texts from our previous Windows Phone 7 reviews (including our dedicated WP7 review). We want you to be sure that even when we reuse portions of the texts, we always take care to check our facts with the review unit thoroughly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, October 7, 2011: The Windows Phone 7.5 update is out and it brings new functionality and resolves some of the issues that we've mentioned in this review. Check out our Windows Phone 7.5 review here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though they weren?t allowed to do a complete UI makeover like they have on other platforms, HTC still managed to give the Trophy that trademark HTC feel. HTC Hub has the well familiar clock and a few other apps that wouldn?t look out of place in a Sense UI environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC added apps include Stocks, Photo Enhancer, Notes and Sound Enhancer. They are all full of eye candy and elaborate animations. A few more apps are available in the HTC Hub too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go into details, here?s a video of the HTC 7 Trophy and the Windows Phone 7 interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old Today screen is gone and it has been replaced with a set of Live tiles. It?s one of the most flexible homescreens we?ve seen. You?ll notice just how many useful things you can put on it as this review goes on. The iconic Start menu is gone too and there?s no trace of the honeycomb pattern either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone 7 Metro UI has two main parts that live side by side ? the homescreen (referred to as ?Start?) and the main menu. You can switch between the two by sideways swipes or using the arrow button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is a grid of Live tiles. Live tiles fit the broad concept of ?widget? but, unlike most widgets out there, are very uniform with clear labels of what each of them does. They display info (e.g. number of messages, the date) and are also the Windows Phone 7 equivalent of homescreen shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color theme of the interface is customizable ? the background can be either dark or light and there?s a long list of accent colors (the fill color of the tiles).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is a traditional list ? this is where all the hubs and installed apps are listed in alphabetical order. A press and hold reveals a context menu, which lets you ?pin? items to the homescreen (that is put their Live tile there), uninstall them or rate and review an app that you?ve downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no folders in the main menu ? so the more apps you install, the longer the list will get. So, finding apps that you chose not to pin to the homescreen may involve plenty of scrolling. The list is alphabetical, so at least you?ll know where to look. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is quite simple ? sideways swipes navigate a sort of tabbed interface and there are on-screen soft keys. This will cover the most commonly used features, but for advanced features you can tap the ?...? symbol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It opens an extended context menu (and also reveals a label under each soft key, if the icon wasn?t revealing enough). Pressing and holding on an item in a list (e.g. a single message) will reveal a context menu relevant to that item only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What Windows Phone 7 has lost since the 6th iteration is multitasking. It handles a lot like a pre-version-4 iOS. The Start key (the one with the Windows logo) will get you out of the app and on the homescreen. Alternatively, you can exit an app using the Back key. That gets you back to the app last used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That last app will continue from exactly the same point from where you left it. Getting back into an app is done by tapping its live tile or shortcut in the menu or by using the back button, which returns to the previous screen (even if it was from a completely different app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, lack of multitasking means you can?t, say, run third party music players (e.g. last.fm) in the background. Apps also get suspended when you lock the screen ? however, there?s the option to allow them to run with a locked screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft will lift that restriction, but only for the apps that prove battery-efficient ? the phone must be able to work at least 6 hours with the app running if it?s a music player and 120 hours otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, all the other apps get suspended when you lock the phone ? unlocking the phone will cause the app or game to reload, which can be slow and you usually lose your progress. This can be very annoying to even casual gamers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no ?recently used? type of list to make going back to the app you need easier ? so you might have to search for it in the main menu or keep hitting the Back button until you see it. So, multitasking is not a complete loss, but not quite as comfortable as true multitasking OSes either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has its head in the cloud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People hub assumes the responsibilities of the phonebook, though calling it a ?phonebook? is not very accurate. Instead of contacts, you have people with profiles ? a term borrowed straight out of the social networking domain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends ? everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap on any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to skip dircetly to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and they can be displayed as ?First Last? or ?Last, First? (the two settings are separate), you can also include or exclude Facebook friends, import only Facebook contacts that have a phone number and add several accounts to sync with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side shows only new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recently called contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact?s profile shows the contact photo. Below that there are actions ? ?call mobile?, ?text mobile?, ?write on wall?, ?view website? and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the ?What?s new? panel, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good, no smart dial is bad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy held on to signal quite well though it did drop a call in an area of poor reception. During a call, the sound is loud (pretty loud at the loudest setting) and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets ? a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead ? the Trophy did fairly well recognizing our commands, though it did have issues separating the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name of Mandark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist ? it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What?s missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone ? a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly for a fee).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an incoming call, the contact?s photo will appear full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note ? status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy scored a Good mark in our traditional loudspeaker performance test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of Windows Phone 7 uses threaded view to organize your messages. When you start the app, you?ll see a list of conversations ? each one consists of multiple messages displayed as speech bubbles, which are ordered by the time they were sent/received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An empty speech bubble will hang at the bottom waiting for you to type a response. A message can have multiple recipients too by using the + button next to the recipient field. Just the first few letters of the contact?s name are needed ? the search feature will find it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can attach a photo to turn the message into an MMS ? either an existing photo or you can snap one on the fly. You can add only one though and you can only attach photos (not videos). The photos get downscaled too before sending, so you can't email full resolution shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email app is pretty good. It easily retrieved the settings for our Gmail and Hotmail test accounts. Each inbox is separate and you can pin it to the homescreen, though there?s no aggregated inbox view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to display all, unread or flagged messages ? by sweeps to the side and you can browse all folders for the email account and batch operations are easy ? a tap on the left side of the screen selects the message, so you can move it, mark it as (un)read or flag it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each message can be flagged, which is a great way to sort only the emails that are important right now ? just tap the ?toggle flag? option from the context menu when you?re done with them and they are off the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried emailing a photo from Trophy's camera, but the email app downscaled it before sending ? so, emailing full resolution shots is no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is a traditional virtual QWERTY with not too many surprises. It can suggest words as you type and correct spelling and also auto-capitalize letters following a full stop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The response was great and the spell correction turned out very accurate ? we were able to type very fast with very little practice. The overall experience was very positive and even heavy texters should be quite happy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery with connections to the cloud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub is the photo gallery of Windows Phone 7. When you start it, it shows the most recent photos (including those from the camera), What?s new (which shows photos from online services) and a menu, which lets you view all photos, photos sorted by date and your favorite photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing an individual photo supports pinch zooming and you can easily upload the photo to Facebook or share it on some other service. There?s an option to automatically strip geo-tagging information before uploading it to online services ? that way your offline album will still be geo-tagged, but you won?t have to worry about privacy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub will automatically pull photos from your SkyDrive, Windows Live and Facebook accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve had no issues with speed ? Microsoft?s minim spec requirement guarantees that even 5MP photos are handled without a snag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even so, Microsoft has decided to downscale photos when they are transferred from a computer to the phone using the Zune software (much like emailing a photo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the HTC provided apps ? Photo Enhancer ? can be used to add a bit of flare to photos. It?s a really basic app, you just open a photo and select an effect: Auto enhance, Cinnamon, High contrast, Sepia, Overexposed, Glimmer, Twilight, Vintage, Antique and a few more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, you can apply a few of these effects in the camera itself, but with Photo Enhancer you get to keep both the untarnished original and the modified photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music and videos play to the Dolby and SRS tune<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music and video players are simple and have straightforward interfaces. You won?t have any difficulties using them. However there are some things missing, like equalizers. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger ? you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the album art temporarily reveals three buttons ? repeat, favorite and shuffle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The players can of course work in the background and there?s another nice shortcut ? when you press a volume key, the name of the currently playing track also appears along with play/pause, next and previous buttons (they can also scrub through the song).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen ? like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn?t recognize .AVI files ? in other words, don?t expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .WMV (up to WVGA res) ? so, you can watch those formats on the 7 Trophy, it?s just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer configuration).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best preloaded apps by HTC is the Sound Enhancer. It can apply sound enhancements to both songs and videos ? there are two separate settings, so the music enhancement you choose won?t affect videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable either Dolby Mobile or SRS enhancement and for music you get an equalizer too. It doesn?t support custom presets though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy also has a built in FM radio with a dead simple interface. You have the current frequency in very large digits ? swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the HTC 7 Trophy audio quality is quite a bit short of impressive. There are notable flaws even when you use the handset with an active external amplifier - imperfect frequency response and high intermodulation distortion. The rest of the scores are pretty good, but are still not enough to bring the 7 Trophy up there with its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, as you could expect things get even worse when you plug in a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk increases (though it still remains pretty decent) and intermodulation distortion climbs even further. The 7 Trophy is also not among the loudest devices we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sub-par 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy has a 5MP autofocus camera and LED flash that snaps photos with maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple ? you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy trick for checking out the last few photos is to side slide to the right opens the last picture shot and a slide to the left brings back the camera's live view instantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended settings menu offers control over resolution, metering mode and flicker adjustment and also effects (fewer than the Photo Enhancer effects) and also Scenes presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly the camera key will wake the phone with a single press ? that is unlock it and start the camera. But that feature cleverly doesn?t trigger if there?s something in front of the proximity sensor ? like the insides of your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the photos is rather disappointing ? the post-processing is trying much too hard to hide the noise coming from the image sensor. Fine detail is completely gone and photos are quite soft, despite the sharpening algorithm, which creates pronounced artifacts around each edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples so you can judge yourself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the HTC 7 Trophy to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera does 720p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can record in three resolutions ? QVGA, VGA or 720p. The camera defaults to VGA, which is frustrating ? if you forget to set it to 720p, the videos you thought were shot in HD will be at the much less impressive VGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera fares better than the its still photo counterpart but it?s not good enough to fully redeem the Trophy?s camera. The video is light on the fine detail and there is a slight stutter when objects start moving too fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an HTC 7 Trophy video sample: 720p@25fps.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy was also included in our Video Compare Tool database. Check it out ? the tool?s page includes a quick walkthrough on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC 7 Trophy in the Video Compare Tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a 720p video sample from our new test setup. Pay attention to the second half of the video where we lower the light to show you how the the camcorder performs in more challenging conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity sans Mass storage<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and dual-band 3G with HSPA (7.2Mbps downlink and 2Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP. Bluetooth is currently limited as to what it can do ? there?s no file transfer support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing with a computer is done with the Zune computer application. It?s the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your Trophy ? Windows Phone 7 doesn?t support Mass storage mode. Zune supports syncing over USB and Wi-Fi. There?s a Mac version of Zune in the works too. You can check our detailed review of the Zune software here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another syncing option is the cloud. SkyDrive is a free Microsoft service that gives you 25GB cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great browser, but where?s Silverlight?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer on Windows Phone 7 is the best mobile IE yet. But that doesn?t do it justice ? it?s actually a huge leap forward compared to version 6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Page rendering is perfect and fast, as are panning and scrolling. For zoom, you have double tap and pinch zoom. As an extra guide for navigation there?s the Find on page option. Flipping the phone in landscape orientation clears the onscreen controls and gives the whole screen to the webpage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser can handle up to 6 tabs open at once. It?s a reasonable limit for a mobile device, but tab-lovers might be disappointed. Anyway, even with 6 tabs open the HTC 7 Trophy zipped through webpages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>History and favorites are supported and you can even pin a favorite site to the homescreen. Another handy option is to let Bing suggest sites as you type in the URL and Internet Explorer will also suggest sites from the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some things missing though ? Flash is one, but we were at least hoping for Silverlight, which didn?t work either. Saving files is problematic too ? you can only save files that the OS can handle. Text reflow is another feature we missed ? if you zoom in as much as possible to make fonts readable, you?ll have to pan left and right to read the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.8? WVGA screen on the HTC 7 Trophy strikes a good balance between pocketability and a good browsing experience. The resolution is enough for browsing the desktop versions of sites and the 3.8 inches mean text won?t be too tiny either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is usually the place where we mention YouTube ? on the WP7 the support is rather limited. The current YouTube app in the Marketplace just launches the browser and directs it to the mobile YouTube site. Not any more useful than a bookmark. And the desktop version is no-go of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are alternative browsers in the Marketplace ? but they can only modify the user interface, the rendering is still handled by Internet Explorer. Still, rendering isn?t a problem for IE and an interface you find more comfortable can really improve the browsing experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good organizer package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar prefers two view modes ? agenda and day view. You have month view too, but you can?t access it by side-swiping ? you need to use the soft key for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two softkeys are Today (brings you to the current date) and Add an appointment. That?s the only type of event you get, but it has enough options to suit your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple calendars, including our Google Calendar but we had to add it as an Outlook (ActiveSync) account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set multiple alarms ? each with its own name, ringing sound and repeat pattern. We set up ten and yet the add alarm button didn?t grey out ? the HTC 7 Trophy can handle more alarms than we know what to do with. There?s a basic calculator too, which has big, easy to hit buttons ? turn the phone on its side and the calculator adds hexadecimal digits and a few more operations (e.g. mod).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mobile office is better than ever, still not perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Office hub is an important part of the Windows Phone 7 package. The interface is identical to the other hubs and it?s the best mobile Office suite we?ve seen yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections ? OneNote, Documents and SharePoint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft?s collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you?re done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you?d need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let?s look at the two most important apps ? Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported. PowerPoint files live in the Documents section too ? but they are for viewing only, you can?t edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Word file support is very good. When reading a file, you can tap the Outline key to view a list of all titles from the document. The other way for navigating long files is the Find key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s undo and redo options but strangely, there?s no way to create lists, like in OneNote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the biggest missing feature is copy and paste. That?s a huge miss for a document editor ? you can?t copy and paste parts of other documents, emails, messages, sites, nothing. We?re guessing many people will sooner or later find this omission quite frustrating. Microsoft will be fixing that in early 2011.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel viewer/editor is pretty good too, but like the Word editor it misses some features. You can add formulas to cells (though it?s not as easy as on the desktop Excel and there are fewer cells available), you can sort and filter the cells too, even merge some of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But cell formatting is limited to date, money or percentages. You can?t even change the currency sign. Another must-have missing is row and column insertion. Several sheets are supported but you get three by default and you can?t rename or delete them, nor add new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft?s fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing search, voice commands and SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the Bing website, there are new photos every day to serve as a background, but WP7 has one extra ? three squares on the photo, which give you three interesting facts about what?s in the picture. The copyright sign in the bottom right also reveals the location of the photo (e.g. ?Waterfall on the Arroyo del Salto River?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not useful per se, but it?s a nice ?Did you know...?? type of feature for the curious-minded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like any other Windows Phone 7, HTC 7 Trophy has extensive voice recognition capabilities ? you just press and hold the Windows key and say your command. You can do things like ?Call Sarah at work?, ?Open calendar? and even ?What can I say?? if you?re not sure what commands you can give.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive is Microsoft?s cloud storage service and they offer 25GB of free storage (individual files must be 50MB max). You can integrate it with desktop Windows Explorer and it has some integration with Windows Phone 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right now, you can upload photos including auto uploading of all pictures you snap with the camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Hub and other HTC apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are several HTC apps preloaded on the Trophy and we?ve already covered some of them. Now it?s time to look at the ones we haven?t covered yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Hub for a brief moment looks like Sense UI ? once that moment passes you see that the only thing borrowed from Sense is the clock with a weather forecast. A tap on the clock brings up a five day forecast. You can have multiple locations and the weather conditions are visualized in traditional Sense UI fashion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s those prolonged animations that may be the Hub?s undoing. Each time you start the app, each time you tap the clock there?s an (admittedly attractive) animation that?s several seconds long. The novelty of it will quickly wear out and there?s no option to disable it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, below the clock is a list of featured HTC apps ? the ?Get more? button will take you to the HTC Apps section of the Windows Phone Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes application gives you a 3D cork board to which you can pin notes. A sideways swipe flips the board and displays the notes in the more conventional list view. From HTC Apps you can get Lists ? a to-do app with similar styling to Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final preloaded app we haven?t covered is Stocks. It does what its name suggests ? you can track the stock exchange by adding companies and keeping an eye on the charts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video of the apps so you can see them in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Plotting routes with Bing Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy comes with a capable GPS receiver built-in ? it gets an accurate GPS lock in just a minute. Cell tower and Wi-Fi positioning is available too ? it gets a lock almost instantly but it?s accurate to only 100-150 meters (good enough for location based services).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native mapping app is Bing Maps ? it has two modes (regular map mode and satellite photo mode) and you can get directions and information on nearby businesses too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, when you zoom in down to street level, Bing maps automatically switches to satellite imagery. However, the cool Bird?s eye view from the desktop Bing Maps isn?t available nor is Streetside view (Microsoft?s Street View alternative).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three softkeys available are for directions, my location and search. The extended menu has options to clear the map of any markers you?ve placed, toggling aerial view and accessing the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the map is easy and relatively fast. Zooming is done by pinching, and for a bit of eye candy when new tiles are loaded they fade in smoothly instead of just popping up. Overall the effect is looks much smoother than on Google Maps for Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold places the marker on a specific location ? tap the marker and you get About (a map screenshot and the address, which you can send over a message or email) and Nearby, which shows nearby POI with a rating and basic info (like a phone and a web site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get Directions from my location button, which will find step by step instructions to get you to your destination by either driving or walking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for what?s missing ? there?s no Navigate from here option, which can be quite useful. For example, you?re going to the theater, but want to check how far away the restaurant you?re going to afterwards is from the theater.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still do that, but you can?t pick it from the map ? you have to use the search to find that location. Another thing ? you can?t add more than one destination when planning the route (Google Maps can?t do that either though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there was no trace of voice guided navigation either, even though Windows Mobile 6.x can do it. That?s another thing that 2011 is expected to bring, though it hasn?t been confirmed officially.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Try before you buy at the Marketplace<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace has gotten a few tweaks since we last saw it. It?s organized into four main sections ? applications, games, music and the HTC Apps. A fifth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update ? there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it?s on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, Top, New, Free and finally, Categories which has the games sorted into genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too ? new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (it?s 15 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections ? so, songs get mixed in with the apps and games. This is a little annoying since you don?t need song results while searching for an app and vice versa. But still, it?s not a major problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of apps is growing fast (it passed the 2000 apps a while back) and some key apps are already available ? like the official Twitter app for example. The option to install a trial version for a game or app has been added and it?s very convenient ? how much you get to play depends on the individual developer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 30MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Apps section offers HTC-made, HTC-exclusive apps for free. There are handy things like Attentive Phone ? it offers pocket mode, quiet ring on pickup, flip to mute and flip for speaker (features we?ve seen on their Android phones). There are less useful apps like Flashlight and a ?she loves me, she loves me not? app but you?ll probably end up downloading everything from the HTC Apps section.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WP7 as a gaming platform<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox ? from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests ? which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there?s a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live ? the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace offers a decent selection of games ? anything from popular puzzles like Bejeweled to Assassin?s Creed, Guitar Hero and so on. Games are usually in the 5-10 US dollars range but there are some free ones ? and you can also just go for a quick play with a trial version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The WindowsPhone.Live.com cloud has a silver lining<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has added extensive support for ?in the cloud? features in Windows Phone 7. The WindowsPhone.Live.com site is where you can access those features from your browser ? everything from remote wipe to browsing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Open the site in your browser and sign in with the Live ID that you use on your WP7 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once that?s done you have access to the Find My Phone features. You can make the phone ring or see its last location on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it turns out that your phone is lost, you can lock it and leave a ?please return? note on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you fear it?s been stolen, you can remote wipe it too (which erases all data from the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Live also lets you browse and edit contacts, calendar events and OneNotes too (those are edited with Office Live).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also browse photos you?ve uploaded to SkyDrive. We already mentioned that the camera of every WP7 phone can be set to automatically upload all pics you snap there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of SkyDrive, using Windows Live Mesh you can sync your computer with your SkyDrive account too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Windows Phone 7 mobiles there seems to be a status quo ? great hardware and a tinge of disappointment on the software side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy is no exception ? the finish left us with little to complain about. The materials are nice and durable and they are put together perfectly. The camera was certainly a letdown and it might be the one deal breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software for the most part was exactly the same as on the other phones (we won?t see a real difference perhaps until the first WP7 update). Still, the Sound Enhancer is probably the most valuable preloaded app we?ve seen on a WP7 phone and the others were a welcome addition too (more eye candy than useful though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also like the trend of each manufacturer setting up their own plot of land in the Marketplace and filling it with free stuff. That, by the way, is one of the few things makers can do to set their products apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being a Windows Phone 7, the HTC 7 Trophy has a very strict set of rules to follow and very little room to distinguish itself from other WP7 phones. Still, if you look close enough, you may agree it?s the closest to midrange Windows Phone 7 has been. That?s not necessarily an advantage though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy is up against the likes of the LG E900 Optimus 7 and the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7. The Optimus 7 has goodies like DLNA and Intelligent shot (and lower price), while the Omnia 7 packs Samsung?s excellent 4? SuperAMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG E900 Optimus 7 ? Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 ? HTC 7 Mozart</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Mozart has pretty much the same specs as the Trophy, save for the higher resolution camera (8MP with xenon flash) and the slightly smaller screen (by just 0.1?). The camera is the major drawback of the Trophy so this might be the better option if you?re after a better snapper but we?re yet to test Mozart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 prides itself in excellent Microsoft Office support, Web 2.0 services, Facebook integration, cloud storage and so on. The HTC 7 Trophy is a well-built tool that does just that and a good addition to the WP7 lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s pricey but it can?t help it, it?s far from stellar in terms of specs because it observes the chain of command. It?s got to deal with a number of limitations forced upon by Microsoft. But it?s good looking and well built ? and it?s got the pedigree, you can?t deny it.</paragraph>
