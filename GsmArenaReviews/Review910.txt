			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android slates are available in almost every screen diagonal under the sun, and LG had plenty of targets to aim for, planning their return to the tablet game. An 8.3-inch display looks like the right choice, considering how the scene has changed in the Koreans' absence, more than two years now since their first Optimus tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compact tablets have become the popular choice, propelled by the success of the Nexus line, while ten-inchers have been struggling to cope with the iPad pressure. On the other hand, Apple too must've felt compelled to respond to the expansion of compact Android tablets, hence the iPad mini, which has a screen diagonal of 7.9 inches sharp. It must be part of the reason too why LG went for 8.3 inches, which is the largest diagonal that can still fit in one hand according to its test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pad's display is of WUXGA (1920 x 1200) resolution, for a 16:10 screen aspect ratio. What this means is wider viewing area than traditional 1080p screens, which is more comfortable for reading and web browsing, the flipside being unused screen space when watching video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pad is powered by a quad-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 600 processor with Krait 300 cores - the same combo ticking inside the Optimus G Pro phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device also integrates into your living room multimedia setup, as there's an IR-port up top for operating HDTV's and set-top boxes, and the integrated QRemote app lets you customize settings for different room locations as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick rundown of the features found on the LG G Pad:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has put a 5MP primary camera on the G Pad, which may not sound like much, but it is a tablet after all. Unfortunately, there are a few prominent features missing, such as NFC connectivity and voice call support. Those are all pretty minor shortcomings for a tablet, too, so we doubt anyone will lose interest because of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few other missing pieces when compared with the G Pro include HDR video recording, Dolby Mobile sound enhancement, and most notably the Dual Screen Dual Play ability, which lets you stream content to your TV screen wirelessly or through the MHL port onto a larger display while simultaneously using the screen on the G Pad for something else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the argument must've been that what can be done on a phablet isn't necessarily going to be comfortable or useful on a bigger scale. And the G Pad looks like a solid tablet with good in-hand feel thanks its relatively low for the size 338 grams of weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet has a 4,600 battery, which is lower than what you'd find on LG's last tablet but on par with some of the main competitors. We're curious to see how this translates into real usage, and will be sure to test that extensively as we go on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next, we get things under way with our traditional hardware checkup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The slim LG G Pad 8.3 comes in an equally compact box featuring the standard accessories. The charger has an output of 1.8A which makes all the right difference compared to the 1A run-of-the-mill chargers and keeps the charging times of the large battery reasonable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microUSB cable for charging and connectivity alongside some leaflets round out the set of accessories - there is no QuadBeat headset, which most of LG's latest offerings had.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG kept the design minimalistic and understated, which works well with the midsize and compact nature of the device. The screen bezels are impressively small - especially on the sides - and the paintjob includes the front of the device, unlike most other LG devices where the front remains black regardless of what's on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 measures 216.8 x 126.5 x 8.3mm, which makes it just 6.8mm taller and 0.3mm thicker than the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0, while trimming the width by almost 10mm and matching its weight exactly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to slimming up the bezels, LG was able to really keep the G Pad 8.3 compact and the fact that it's also very light compared to other midsize tablets should help its case further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back is made of plastic and metal and on our white version they handled fingerprints impressively well. However the black unit that we encountered back at the IFA was quite easy to turn into a greasy mess. Good news is both versions provide pretty decent grip, so dropping the G Pad 8.3 is not that much of a risk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is obviously a major feature and we'll talk about its image quality in the next chapter. The glass above the display is flat, and the plastic edge that runs around the sides of the phablet meets evenly with the edge of the glass, making the transition from glass front to polycarbonate sides as smooth as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the usual setup - an LG logo, proximity sensor and the secondary 1.3MP front-facing camera right next to it. Obviously, the LG G Pad 8.3 does not support dual-video recording, which means you'll have to choose which camera to capture video with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no hardware Home button below the display, as all three capacitive buttons are integrated into the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the G Pad 8.3 is bare, while the right features a power/lock button as well as the volume rocker. Both buttons have an almost vertical orientation compared to the rounded sides, and offer good resistance while being easy to press and locate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the G Pad has an IR emitter for the remote control functionality and the 3.5mm audio jack. Here's where you'll also find the microSD card port hidden under a plastic flap. It's easy to open yet locks in place firmly. The mechanism feels like it should last a while without breaking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom you'll find the microUSB port next to the microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery on the Pad 8.3 is non-removable, so you'll have to settle for enjoying the pleasant texture on the back panel without being able to see what's underneath. The 5MP camera is not centered like on most tablets, and is instead placed in the top left corner. There's flash to speak of, and no camera bump either, so the device sits flat when you rest it on its back. There are twin speakers on the right side, top in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pad 8.3 is a solidly built yet compact midsize tablet which has a lot going for it in terms of both handling and portability. The slim waistline and nicely-textured back panel make holding it a breeze, and the low weight means that you'll have no problems with it in a casual setting.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The eye-catching 8.3" capacitive touchscreen of 1920 x 1200 pixels resolution is definitely one of the LG G Pad's key selling points. The pixel density equates to about 273ppi, which is amongst the highest you'll find on a similarly-sized screen. LG is keen on making lots of noise about how the colors are rendered on their panels, compared to Samsung's AMOLED displays. Long story short, LG claims the G Pad 8.3's display shows 100% accurate colors, unlike AMOLED screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, we took it for a test drive ourselves and we can safely confirm that the images indeed look great and colors pop, especially the reds. Here's how it stacks up to the Google Nexus 7, that has a LED-backlit IPS display of the same resolution, although at a notably smaller diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3's display is not only sharp, but has very good resistance to reflectivity and almost no contrast loss when viewed from an angle. Previous LG screens would show contrast shifts at a much smaller angle and with a much stronger intensity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen scored one of the highest contrast ratios we've seen on a tablet, and also one of the lowest brightness levels we've tested, tablet or smartphone. has about the same brightness though the contrast is better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive sensor on the screen is very sensitive and will detect touches even if you're wearing gloves, using a long fingernail or an improvised stylus (like keys, some pens, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the Pad 8.3's display matrix up close:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The G Pad 8.3 features a non-removable 4600mAh battery. We weren't able to do our full battery endurance test as it requires data network connectivity, but we did test web browser and video playback performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pad ran for right around 7 hours and 4 minutes of constant browser usage before giving out, which puts it around the middle of the pack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playback also scored around the middle of the pack with a time of 6:53.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface powered by Android Jelly Bean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 is powered by Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean with the company's own custom skin on top. The customizations run deep and there's a rich selection of themes, changeable icons and home-brewed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've shot a brief video showing off the Android Jelly Bean user interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool LG lockscreen is very similar to what's found on the original Optimus G, where swiping from any spot on the homescreen pops up a circular preview of what's underneath. You can choose from a variety of circular effects, including the classic magnified bubble view, or the default particle effect. You can also place up to five shortcuts that will unlock the phone straight into an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add lockscreen widgets as well - including different clocks - and have a shortcut to the camera when you swipe to the right from the clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the homescreen fits up to 8 shortcuts, which includes the shortcut to the App Drawer. You don't have to use all available slots though - you can discard all but the App Drawer shortcut if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the shortcuts are visible on any of the homescreen panes. With the exception of the app drawer shortcut, you can rearrange, delete or replace any of these with shortcuts of your choosing, even folders. In fact, most aspects of the phone's behavior can be customized, you can go to as small detail as the capacitive key backlight and the transition effect between homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG home-baked tweaks and enhancements are by no means limited to the visuals. The Q Slide option makes it possible for you to watch a video while using other apps, while the system-wide QuickMemo integration allows you to take a screenshot anywhere in the phone and take notes over it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can resize widgets or you can even shrink a widget down to the corresponding app's icon. Also if you move a widget over an occupied slot on the homescreen, the icons underneath immediately move out of the way, which is really neat and comes as part of Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done by tapping and holding on a blank area on any of the panes. A context menu appears, allowing you to add various customizations to your phone. The tabs along the bottom let you select the appropriate app, widget or wallpaper, which you can add to the homescreen pane of your choice. Gridlines will appear when you hold and drag an app or widget, allowing you to easily place it on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a set of different icons to choose from and you can even make custom ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contextual menu gives you quick access to different settings, as well as themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has also enabled plenty of other customization options for the homescreen. There's a dedicated setting for looped homescreen scrolling and the so-called screen effect changes the transition effect between homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has also been tweaked to let you rearrange the toggle buttons available. You are also free to add and remove toggles from the edit menu. You can add an insane amount of shortcuts here, and don't have to worry about whether they'll fit on the screen - the row becomes side-scrollable so you can still access them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, if you have a music track playing in the background, quick controls will show up here. You can also swipe notifications to the left or right to dismiss them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default you get seven homescreen panes to fill up with widgets and shortcuts, but you are free to delete any that you don't need to speed up navigation. You can also set any one homescreen as your default, which pops up first whenever you unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher hasn't changed a whole lot since ICS. It's accessed by holding down the home button, and shows you all of the currently running apps that you can then swipe left or right to terminate. The task switcher is accessed by holding down on the hardware home button. There, you'll also find a shortcut to Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, there are number of icons at the bottom, which let you quickly open up a particular app or even stop all apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a shortcut to the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's task manager lists the currently running apps, but also lets you uninstall apps and gives you info on your storage. It comes with its own dedicated widget, which shows a graph of the available RAM and conveniently offers a button to clear up memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer lists all your available apps and widgets, with a dedicated tab for user downloads. There is a button in the top right corner, which triggers edit mode and lets you to easily reshuffle or uninstall applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can make the icons in the app drawer smaller too. If you select an app whilst in edit mode, a pop up will let you see information like RAM usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG borrowed a trick from Samsung's TouchWiz and implemented its own version of Samsung's Smart Stay - called Smart screen. It uses the front-facing camera to detect whether you're looking at the screen. This means you can browse the phone for hours on end without it auto-locking itself. We can confirm that the feature works very well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As an integral part of Android Jelly Bean, Google Now is present on the G Pad 8.3. You can get to it by swiping up from the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will display information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to Google Now and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Google Now widget which generates information for you based on what your interests are.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 boasts a Snapdragon 600 chipset with four Krait 300 cores clocked at 1.7GHz, 2GB of RAM and the Adreno 320 GPU. This is identical to what powers the Optimus G Pro, so we expect numbers more or less in line with those of the 5.5-inch phablet, with most difference due to the fact that the G Pad has to some more pixels to push.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pad 8.3 managed to join its G Pro brethren on top of the Benchmark Pi and Linpack tests, and was also able to beat out the Nexus 7 and Galaxy Note 8.0.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our compound benchmarks, the G Pad did well once again, scoring towards the top of the charts in AnTuTu, Geekbench 3, and Quadrant. It handily outclassed its main rivals in the form of the Nexus 7 and Galaxy Note 8.0.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran GFXBench (formerly GLBenchmark) tests off-screen, which means we're testing at a fixed resolution and getting numbers for raw GPU power. The G Pad 8.3 didn't disappoint, and even outdoes the Optimus G Pro in the less-intensive Egypt test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But video benchmarks running at native resolution will give the most accurate portrayal of real world performance, which is why we've included the Unreal Engine 3-powered Epic Citadel benchmark. Unreal Engine is popular with mobile game makers, so it's a pretty important test. Here is where the G Pad 8.3 failed to top our charts this time around, but still posted a respectable score of 36.3 fps, which is quite playable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our browser benchmarks show some great numbers from the G Pad 8.3, with the tablet scoring near the top of the category in the SunSpider web benchmark. With HTML 5 thrown into the mix in Browsermark and Vellamo, the G Pad does even better.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Overall, the Snapdragon 600 platform performs admirably on the LG G Pad 8.3. If you're planning on doing a lot of web surfing, the G Pad provided some excellent results, while the CPU also held firm in its own benchmarks. The real-time GPU performance is not stellar, but the results we achieved were still more than adequate.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook sans network calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the G Pad 8.3 is pretty much the standard Jelly Bean affair with added UI goodies sprinkled on top. It has a tabbed interface, in which the central tab lists all contacts alphabetically. You can navigate the tabs by swipes or, alternatively, touch the specific tab labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because this is a Wi-Fi only tablet, all the options related to calling are removed, but you can still store contact phone numbers alongside images, email addresses, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet interface splits the screen into two, with your contact list on the left and your selected contact details on the right. There's a quick alphabet scroll on the right and a regular search bar on top of the contacts list. Besides the contact list, the other tabs are Groups and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phonebook from getting messy - you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, Twitter contacts and so on). The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed - First Name, Last Name or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can edit the contact info by hitting the pencil icon in the upper right corner, while the star icon next to it will add them to favorites. Editing a contact is pretty straightforward: you can add or remove fields as needed, as well as specify the types of phone numbers, email addresses, ringtones, additional fields and even add notes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the G Pad 8.3, to find out that it has a decent speaker. It scored an mark of Good and should not be difficult to hear except in the loudest of environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Email capability is excellent with support for Exchange available out of box, and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of SNS integration as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted, spam reports and of course conversation-style email view mode. Your inbox is divided into Primary, Social, and Promotions sections, and you can swipe individual emails to the side for quick archiving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts, and operates in much the same fashion as the Gmail one. If you add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy, although there's no conversation-style view like in Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY, Path, voice and handwriting input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 offers a standard QWERTY keyboard, which features both portrait and landscape typing. The keyboard fills up the screen nicely and offers great ergonomics with ample spacing between keys, still leaving enough room above the keyboard for you to see what you're actually typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of speed and accuracy are commendable in both portrait and landscape. There's a dedicated setting that enables keypress vibrations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Swype-like (LG dubbed it Path keyboard) input as well, though it's somewhat uncomfortably out of sight in the Input Language submenu. You need to enable Shape Writer instead of the standard QWERTY layout in the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input is enabled too, as well as handwriting. Furthermore, since this is a Jelly Bean device there's also support for offline voice typing, as long as you have preinstalled the required language packages. We are really pleased with its speed and accuracy, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8.3" display allows plenty of space for cool keyboard features. One of them is the Split keyboard option from the settings menu. It's pretty easy to enable - just pinch to zoom out on the keyboard in landscape mode. There's also an extend keyboard option as well as one for handwriting. The latter is invoked by flicking the portrait keyboard sideways, to resize it for comfortable one-hand input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, having the Path keyboard option on will conflict with (and effectively disable) the Split and One Hand keyboard options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 uses a near stock Android gallery with a few custom touches here and there. It automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored on the phone. By default, images are sorted by albums, but you can sort by location or time as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different sets are tiled neatly across the screen. You can expand or shrink individual albums using a pinch to zoom gesture, making the elements of the grid of photos either really huge or very tiny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once selected, you can view an image close up by pinch zooming or double tapping on the desired area. There is a sliding gallery along the bottom which allows you to quickly browse other images in the album. On the top there are three shortcuts for quickly sharing, editing or deleting the selected photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share feature offers quick sharing via Email, Google+, Picasa, Memo, Box, SmartShare, Social+, Bluetooth, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app displays images in full resolution. Zooming and panning involves no lag whatsoever on the G Pad 8.3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the LG G Pad 8.3 features an interface optimized for tablets, with tiles to switch between songs, albums, artists and more along the left side rather than on top like on most Optimus smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip songs back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on the album art will bring up a search menu, if you need to look up the title, artist or the album. After that you can pick where to search - your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search. Flipping the device to landscape mode while on the Now playing screen squeezes in a list of other songs by the same artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets which are available without having to plug in headphones, but are missing the Dolby Mobile and Headset enhancer effects found on some LG smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're playing a song it also gets displayed in the notification area, where you can pause and change tracks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the G Pad 8.3 has a fairly simple interface, giving you just a grid of all the videos on the device. There's an alphabetical scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can, of course, play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization. For each video you've started, the thumbnail gets a tiny clock icon, which shows how far into the video you are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated, yet it's quite powerful. The live preview feature is back - it's a YouTube-like pop up preview of the video above the scrubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get the basics out of the way, the available controls during playback include a scrubber for jumping to various parts of the video along with the standard play/pause and skip buttons. There's a pop-out button at the bottom right corner too, indicating that the app is part of the QSlide functionality of the UI. LG have implemented MX Player-like controls too - a swipe left or right will move the video forward or backwards, while a swipe up or down will tweak brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new additions is a Video Speed control (you can set values from 0.5x up to 2x). There's a lock button too, which hides all controls for pure full-screen viewing. Another cool feature in the video player is Live Zooming. You can zoom in (with the familiar pinch gesture) during playback and some serious magnification is allowed, not just a quick resize or fit to screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 handled everything we threw at it - DivX, XviD, MKV and MP4/MOV up to, and including, 1080p resolution. The AC3 audio codec (among lots of others) is supported, so you don't have to worry about the sound. There are were no issues with higher bitrates and file sizes, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG took Samsung's pop-up play feature a whole lot further with QSlide. In the latest iteration of the user interface, LG has added a new batch of apps that take advantage of the functionality. Those include the web browser, Memo, QVoice, Calendar and Calculator. Furthermore, you can launch any of them from the notification drawer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is good if not the best<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 did quite well in the first part of audio output test. Its loudness levels were about average, but everything else about its performance was top notch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is the degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones was more than we are used to seeing from high-end smartphones, let alone tablets. Stereo quality worsened by more than the average amount, some intermodulation distortion crept in and the volume levels worsened. The overall performance is still good, but not quite spotless.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The main camera on the LG G Pad 8.3 has a 5MP sensor that captures photos at a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 and 1080p videos at 30fps. There's also a 1.3MP front-facing camera that shoots 720p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface has been remodeled since the Optimus G Pro, but retains a similar layout of controls. You get a bar on the right with the still/video toggle, a virtual shutter key and gallery shortcut on the right and a column with three shortcuts on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top shortcut toggles between the front and back cameras, the second lets you select the shooting mode, and the gear icon at the bottom opens up a tiled panel of shooting options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between one of nine shooting modes - Normal, HDR, two Panorama modes, Continuous shot, Beauty shot, Time machine capture, Sports, and Night mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Time catch shot feature (also called Time machine camera) snaps a photo, but also records several photos of what happened before you hit the shutter key. You can save any of the photos on that list that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the VR Panorama, basically another name for Photo Spheres. You snap one central photo and then move the phone around to fill out as much of the sphere as you want, blue rectangles appear to guide you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still image quality on the G Pad is not great, as the 5MP sensor had a hard time finding the proper exposure. As a result, highlights were blown out in almost every image, and there was a fair amount of noise. Looking past that, the colors are more or less accurate, but the contrast could use some work as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If your scene is mostly in the shadow, you might want to try HDR mode. It brings out detail in darker areas of the image (with mixed results) though it sacrifices highlights, which is something to watch out for.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera with dual recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface on the video camera is basically the same as on the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 can record 1080p videos at 30fps with the primary camera, and 720p videos with the front-facer. There's no dual-recording mode, and HDR is not available for videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live effects can be applied real-time (that is, ones that are visible in the viewfinder as you shoot the video, not ones applied during post-processing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either use funny face effects (with automatic face detection) or do a sort-of green-screen effect by replacing the static background of the video with something more exciting (this works best with a tripod as shaking the camera causes the whole image to change).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 files with a bitrate of right around 17Mbps for 1080p@30fps mode. Audio is recorded in stereo at 156Kbps and a sampling rate of 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although it has a smaller sensor than found on the LG G2, the G Pad again has an overly-aggressive autofocus, although not to such an extreme degree. Otherwise, the camcorder features the same issues found on the still camera: generally overexposed images and low contrast plus a fair amount of noise.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 isn't the most feature-full device when it comes to connectivity, but it does have most of the basics covered (except network connectivity, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity consists of dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with Wi-Fi Direct, Miracast wireless display, and Wi-Fi Hotspot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi Direct is a technology that lets devices connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty of it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-enabled for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology several (up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to the eventual demise of Bluetooth. Speaking of which, there's also Bluetooth capabilities for connecting accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB port has yet another feature - it enables USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (again, there isn't one in the box).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pad 8.3 has several ways to push out multimedia but it can do more than that - the IR emitter and QRemote app allow it to control your multimedia setup, whether a TV or set top box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple devices to QRemote and organize them by room so it can easily handle your home theater setup or the TVs in all your rooms at home</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is accessible right on the lockscreen by way of a widget, which saves you a click when you want to use the G Pad as a remote. There's no QSlide version of the remote, but you can add it to the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remote can also be configured to launch automatically when the G Pad connects to your home Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity option worth noting is the QPair app. QPair lets you pair the Pad 8.3 with any other smartphone (not just LG models) which runs Android 4.1 or later, although the app warns you that not all features are supported by all phone models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you pair it with a device (which is done through Bluetooth), you can use the tablet to answer calls and messages, as well as transfer QMemos to the phone, or use its internet connection as a Wi-Fi hotspot. Note that you cannot do the same from the phone end.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 features the standard Android browser (with some LG modifications on top), but also comes with Chrome preinstalled so you are given a choice right from the start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard browser offers the typical minimalist interface, with the address bar, used both for typing URLs and initiating web searches, on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling down moves the address bar out of view. In previous versions, there was a bottom control bar that housed back and forward keys and a few shortcuts, but LG has made the default Android browser identical to Chrome, offering the usual capacitive keys below and shifting the aforementioned navigation buttons up top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the very left of this top navigation menu is the QSlide button, which turns the browser into a floating mini app. You can't switch between tabs in this mode, but the top control bar is still available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without it keeping track of your history or storing cookies. It can also save pages for offline reading: they go in the Saved section of your bookmarks, and can be accessed even when you're no longer connected to the internet. The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a history section in addition to the Saved pages list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find on page, desktop view, and share page options are available from the contextual menu. If you tap and hold on some text you get the usual markers and select/copy/find/web search/share options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pad 8.3 supports double tap and pinch zoom. There's text reflow too - it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you've pinched to zoom in, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text. Text remains legible even at very low zoom levels thanks to the high pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The powerful quad-core hardware enables the G Pad browser to play Flash videos within the browser without a hitch, and most Flash-based ads play without a hitch. But if full Flash content is what you're after, you'll have to side-load the app as it's no longer available through the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is also available on the G Pad 8.3 out of the box. It doesn't support Flash or QSlide, but it will sync tabs (among other things) with the Chrome browser on your computer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The G Pad 8.3 comes with the usual set of organizing apps and one of the most advanced document viewers and editors we've seen yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is Polaris Office 5. The app will automatically list all the files found on your device and attached storage, sorted by type. You can of course view documents - Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and PDF files too, and there's an option as well to export Word and PowerPoint docs as PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit mode offers almost a full set of options - text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, and even creating tables. If you're editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, cell merging and so on. Full-featured PowerPoint presentations can be created too, and there's handwriting markups supported across all document types.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has a split screen interface - the top part is reserved for the monthly calendar and one on the bottom for the agenda/daily/weekly view. This way you will always have your monthly view visible. While the border line between the two sections is not fixed, it only lets you snap it to the top, bottom, or slightly below the midline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar supports QSlide so you can check your schedule while writing an email without having to switch between apps all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to enjoy the calendar full screen without anything getting in the way, just turn the tablet landscape. The G Pad is syncable with multiple online calendars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 features an alarm clock application, which lets you set multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time, and ringtone. You can enable application autostartup, so the calendar/email/music player/ tasks/weather app launches when the alarm goes off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a clever feature called puzzle lock, which will make you solve a simple puzzle to disable the alarm. This way you will only be able to stop the ringing when you have properly woken up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Timer, World Clock and Stopwatch features are also part of this app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a useful voice recorder and a nicely touch-optimized calculator. The calculator is QSlide enabled to always be at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app lets you take notes and add media to them, such as images, audio, or location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notebook is more advanced and let you create books with multiple pages, add multimedia, draw, and even export as PDF and email them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QuickMemo function is integrated in the phone's OS, allowing you to capture screen shots of anything (including the lockscreen!) and scribble notes over them like you would on the LG Optimus G Pro and Vu. You can save the result as an image or add it to the Notebook app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can quickly access QuickMemo by holding down the volume up and volume down buttons simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Kweather app shows you the forecast by the hour or for the whole week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a QTranslator app, which uses the camera to scan text (a word, line or block at a time) and translate it from one language to another. It's a bit slow and requires a data connection, but it can help you out if you're abroad and don't speak (or read) the language. The OCR (scanning the text) sometimes runs into trouble and produces garbage, but the translations are fairly good by automatic standards - that is to say, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 managed to get GPS lock in less than half a minute from cold start without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock but it involves an active data connection. Wi-Fi positioning is also available if all you need is a rough location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection. Initial route planning requires data to be enabled, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play for all your app needs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Play is the place to get various apps for your device. The version found on the G Pad 8.3 features a special section for tablet essentials as determined by Google - a collection of mostly free apps that are optimized for use on Android-powered tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Home window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view. Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending. New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.). You can also see if updates are available for your currently installed apps by going to My Apps in the contextual menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG SmartWorld app store is also on board. It's similar to the SamsungApps market - there you can find various content and promotions exclusive to LG users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 is certainly one of the most compelling tablet choices on the market right now. It's among a special few to offer Full HD resolution on a sub-9" tablet, and has an excellent design to go with it. The lightweight and thin construction also make handling a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But a few sacrifices had to be made to hang a competitive price tag on that package. Most notably the Snapdragon 600 chipset, which while pretty snappy at this point raises a few questions about future-proofing. The dropped NFC support and, of course, network data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The midsize tablet market has a few convincing alternatives, most notably in the form of Apple's new iPad mini with Retina display. The just-announced device is smaller and thinner (but wider) than the G Pad, and sports a 7.9-inch display of 1536 x 2048 pixels resolution that results in higher pixel density. It also has a slightly faster chipset with the new A7 sitting under the hood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Retina iPad mini has a far larger number of tablet-optimized apps to rely on, but even the base model is in a higher price range already, even if you can settle for 16GB of storage. There's no expansion slot there, so realistically you'll have to part with about &#x20ac;150 more to own the Apple slate. So while the iPad mini is probably the superior tablet, it just doesn't offer the same value for your money as its LG rival.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad mini 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's 2013 edition Nexus 7 is also a serious contender in this category, as it sports the same screen resolution panel on a 7-inch diagonal, which allows it to match the pixel density of the iPad mini (not that the G Pad screen isn't sharp). Like the iPad mini you'll have to make do without a microSD card slot and IR-port, and the chipset is clocked lower than on the LG slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, for the same price as the G Pad 8.3 you could get a Nexus 7 with 32GB of storage andLTE support. And you'll be sure to receive future Android updates in a timely manner, even if you will be skipping on the extra functionality brought by the LG custom launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 7 is perhaps the biggest obstacle the LG G Pad 8.3 faces - cheaper and matching it for both performance and resolution, the Nexus slate seems like the more reasonable purchase. It only has a 7" screen, though, and we are sure many will find that insufficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Google Nexus 7 (2013)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Amazon's Kindle saw a major upgrade this year, and the latest Kindle Fire HDX comes in two sizes - 7" and 8.9" screen diagonal. They both have above Full HD resolution and a very powerful quad-core 2.2 GHz Snapdragon 800 processor with Adreno 330 GPU. You'll be giving up expandable storage, and, more importantly the Play Store access, which puts those two in a rather different niche.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Amazon Kindle Fire HDX &#x2022; Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 8.9</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No self-respecting comparison would be complete without Samsung chiming in in some form, in this case with it's Galaxy Note 8.0. LG may be targeting the iPad minis but at least a corner of an eye is on Korean neighbors. The Note 8.0 comes in thinner and shorter and has the exact same weight of 338 grams, but is almost 10mm wider and the screen bezels are much larger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1.6GHz quad-core Exynos chip inside is starting to show its age and the screen is of far lower resolution. What the Note tablet does have however, is network connectivity (including an LTE variant), along with Samsung's excellent S-Pen stylus and supporting apps for about the same price as the Pad 8.3. We'd still say the LG slate is the far better value here, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 N5100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3's story is written by its crisp display, capable chipset, and compact design, which almost stand for the pinnacle of LG's mobile tech. Obviously, the lack of network support relegates this to a living room tablet, which is why a more complete QRemote app would have been better (not just for TV's and set top boxes from predefined manufacturers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite these shortcomings though, the capable software package and powerful hardware are enough to make the Pad 8.3 a strong competitor. The fact that LG was able to fit all that into such a compact package is impressive in its own right, and there are even hints of an LTE version in the works, so maybe you will be able to have it all.</paragraph>
