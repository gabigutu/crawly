			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original Xiaomi Redmi 3 is still considered as one of the best deals you could get on a 5-inch affordable smartphone, but you may have missed the fact it's also got a Pro sibling. If the specs on the Redmi 3 are just a notch too vanilla for your taste, you might as well spice it all up with a few neat upgrades such as more storage, more RAM and a fingerprint reader on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty much the same - a 5" 720p IPS display, an aluminum body, a Snapdragon 616 chipset, a 13MP camera, and a beefy 4,100mAh battery all for a similar sub-$150 price. Just make sure you don't confuse the Redmi 3 and Redmi 3 Pro with the recently launched Xiaomi Redmi 3s, which sells for the same price but has an inferior, albeit newer, chipset and a more recent Android version. Yes, Xiaomi's smartphone portfolio follows a naming pattern that's hard to make sense of but fret not, we're here to help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3 has been quite popular thanks to the compact body, affordable price tag and capable hardware. The Pro version costs some 30% more than the regular one (CNY899 vs. CNY699) and in return, it offers more RAM, more storage, and a fingerprint reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3s and the Redmi 3x, on the other hand, are based on a different hardware platform - they use the Snapdragon 430 instead of the Snapdragon 616 - it's a slower chipset, but it also happens to be newer, so it has a faster LTE modem and a faster GPU. They also have a more recent version of Android out of the box - they run MIUI 7.3 with Android 6.0.1, but MIUI 8.x for the original Redmi 3's is already in beta as well so it shouldn't be too long until it gets updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3s is available in two variants as well - the 2GB/16GB w/o fingerprint sensor - and The Redmi 3s Prime, which has 3GB/32GB plus a fingerprint sensor. These variants cost the same as the Redmi 3 (CNY699) and the Redmi 3 Pro (CNY899) respectively. The internals of the Redmi 3x are the same as those in the Redmi 3s, but the design is different (more angular, less beveled edges), and it can be purchased only in a 2GB/16GB configuration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of purchasing, it's worth pointing out that the Redmi 3 and its Pro version are currently officially sold only in China but thanks to grey imports, the phone can already be had in other countries and the software is already localized in a number of languages with the silent support of Xiaomi themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're sure that those of you that don't mind spending a little extra for the added features that the Redmi 3 Pro offers are already wondering whether any of the other aspects of the device are still as good as the original. Well, we intend to find that out just now, starting with a look in the retail box on the next page.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3 Pro isn't particularly generous with the accessories: a 2A A/C Adapter and a microUSB cable for charging and data is all you get. Hardly a surprise - the original Redmi 3 didn't offer anything extra either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 139.3 x 69.6 x 8.5mm and 144g, the Redmi 3 Pro is identical size-wise with the original and the Redmi 3s flavor. Consistency is a good thing - the Pro variant adds a fingerprint scanner and more RAM plus storage over the Redmi 3 while the Redmi 3s Prime adds the same things over the Redmi 3s. The identical exterior of the Redmi 3 Pro and 3s suggests they will probably target different markets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro keeps the unibody design and curvy edges but gets rid of the diamond pattern for a clean and smooth finish. All three Redmi 3 Pro paint jobs - gold, silver and dark gray - use solid colors, no gradient or pattern whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the missing texture, everything about the Redmi 3 Pro feels familiar. We got the silver edition, which combines a white front and a silver rear cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back may fool you that it's all metal, but the top and bottom bits - where the antennas are placed - are both made of matte plastic to not obstruct reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunk in fingerprint sensor on the back is quite nice and fits well in the stylish design. It's an always-on scanner performing reasonably fast. It must be one of the reasons for Xiaomi to opt out of the diamond pattern - the back would've looked too cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5" Redmi 3 Pro is perfectly sized to allow reasonably comfortable one-hand operation and yet its screen is big enough to enjoy a movie or a game. The phone is compact, perhaps a bit heavy, so you won't be patting your pocket often to check if it's still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro's aluminum case provides enough grip, but also for a rather sturdy built, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro's layout of controls is nothing out of the usual. Above the display, the earpiece is sided by a couple of sensors and the 5MP selfie camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, we find the traditional capacitive control set: Task switcher, Home, and Back keys. There is a status LED around too. The keys are still not backlit, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side houses the ejectable compartment, which can either take two SIM cards or one SIM and a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is where the volume rocker and the power/lock key are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the Redmi 3 we find the audio jack, the secondary mic, and the IR blaster. At the bottom is the primary mic and the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera lens is on the back, accompanied by a single LED flash. The loudspeaker grille is also around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro features a 5" 720p IPS screen, the same size and resolution available on the original Redmi 3, for a pixel density of 294ppi. That's near Retina-grade, enough for crisp images and sharp text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a closer look at it under our digital microscope reveals a standard RGB arrangement of the sub-pixels that make up the Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro LCD panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is still no information on the protective coating and there is a good chance it doesn't have any enhanced scratch-resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro achieved a bit higher maximum brightness compared to its predecessor - 561nits vs 520 nits. At the lowest level, the screen is spectacularly dim at just 1.1nits, which is as low as it gets and should be easy on the eyes in any dark environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black levels are OK for an LCD panel and, combined with the high brightness, the Redmi 3 Pro achieved a respectable contrast of 1145:1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an average deviation (DeltaE) of 6.4 the screen's color accuracy is about average. The colors are punchy, but if you want a more color accurate representation you may want to try the Warm Color options. The colors look somewhat dull though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Outdoors, the Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro is an above average performer in terms of sunlight legibility. The glass on top of the display is reflective, but most of the time you'll have no problem viewing the screen content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro is powered by a 4,100mAh battery which is a serious power pack for a 5" device. It's also of the same capacity as the original Redmi 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our battery test, and the Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro scored a 104h rating, which means you can count on the battery to last 4 days and then some if you do an hour each of calling, web browsing and video playback a day. Such usage pattern may be somewhat artificial, but we've established it, so our battery results are comparable across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The endurance rating is about the same achieved by the Redmi 3 which is about right. If you want to use the phone with two SIM cards, it will cost you half a day.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro supports 7 LTE bands, and you can tap to an LTE network on either SIM, but once you do, the second one will be limited to GSM connectivity only. As for that, the Redmi 3 Pro also offers tri-band GSM connectivity. There is quad-band 3G connectivity with HSPA support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity features include single-band Wi-Fi b/g/n/ support and Wi-Fi Direct. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.1, GPS with GLONASS and Beidou, plus an FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microUSB 2.0 port handles charging and data connections. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory over a USB connection. The microUSB port also supports USB On-the-go for connecting USB peripherals such as pen drives, keyboards or USB hard drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wireless screen mirroring is available via the Miracast protocol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IR blaster is located on the top and coupled with the right software, it can be used to operate almost any remotely controlled home appliance, turning the Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro into a universal remote. Xiaomi provides its MiRemote app right out of the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro runs on MIUI 7.3, which utilizes an Android 5.1.1 Lollipop core. MIUI is one of the most comprehensive customizations of Android. It has a big following in China where Google services are not accessible so Xiaomi refocused the ecosystem away from Mountain View's services. For those living elsewhere, there are various international ROMs, which come stripped from the Chinese services, in favor of Google's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is fairly standard (time, notifications, a couple of shortcuts), but once you setup the fingerprint reader you'll rarely see it anyway. Still, the Wallpaper Carousel can put beautiful images on the lockscreen every 15 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The always-on fingerprint sensor proved quite accurate and can take the phone from sleep to homescreen pretty quickly (the lockscreen is bypassed). It's not as fast as some flagship implementations, but the speed is quite okay at about 1.5s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI has a simple philosophy - every shortcut, plus widgets of your choosing are dropped on the homescreen. You get a docked menu for the most commonly used apps and there's a search field in the notification area if you can't remember where you put a rarely used app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two panes. The first shows notifications (and the search field), swipe left and you get the quick toggles and the brightness slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app switcher feels like it came out of iOS 6.0 - apps are represented by their icons, in a single horizontal row. No matter the screen size, you don't get to see a lot of apps at a time and you don't get to see a preview of the state in which you've left the individual apps. You can pinch zoom to switch to the standard thumbnail card view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are fully supported and several are available out of the box. You can download more, they change wallpapers, lockscreen style, system icons and font, sounds too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Xiaomi's proprietary Search widget does a similar job as iOS's Spotlight system-wide search. You can fire it up by swiping up anywhere on the homescreen. The tool searches through your apps, music, email, settings, among others.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro, just like the original Redmi 3, is powered by the Snapdragon 616 chipset. The SoC offers eight Cortex-A53 cores, four of them ticking at 1.5GHz and another four running at 1.2GHz. The GPU in charge of graphics is Adreno 405 while the available RAM is now 3GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single-core performance of an A53 core is nothing to talk about, really. It gets destroyed by the A72 processor inside the Redmi Note 3 (the Snapdragon model).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eight A53 is not an impressive picture either, especially when those are clocked at 1.2 and 1.5 GHz. Those are pretty much on par with the raw processing power of the Oppo F1 (same chip), Xiaomi Redmi 3 (same chip), but are easily overshadowed by the Redmi Note 3 models (both Helio X10 and Snapdragon). The Huawei P9 Lite powered by the Kirin 650 is quite a threat, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compound AnTuTu 5 shows the Redmi 3 Pro is as powerful as its Redmi 3 predecessor, which is expected. The new AnTuTu 6, which gauges CPU, GPU and memory, places the Redmi 3 Pro on par with the Redmi 3 and Oppo F1 - both powered by the Snapdragon 616. The Xperia E5 is a notch behind those, while the Huawei P9 Lite and Redmi Note 3 (Snapdragon) are way more powerful.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BaseMark OS II is another compound benchmark, which additionally tests web performance and system behavior. The Redmi 3 Pro's 3GB RAM gave it an edge over its predecessor, but the Oppo F1 came on top of both.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Adreno 405 can perfectly handle any 720p content you throw at it, and that's noticeable in the GFX 3.0 on-screen benchmark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p Offscreen test results, on the other hand, can show you how the chipset stacks against the competition as far as the raw GPU performance is concerned.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BaseMark X GPU test places the Redmi 3 close to other similarly priced devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 616 chipset undoubtedly provides more than enough power for the Redmi 3 Pro - especially since it runs everything on the undemanding 720p screen resolution. The chipset seems like a great match for the Redmi 3 Pro ambitions for providing great day-to-day performance and an excellent feature package on budget pricing. Only OpenGL 3.1 compatibility is missing for rendering high-end mobile graphics, but most games will run just fine with only perhaps lowered graphics quality here and there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the phonebook share a single app although there are two shortcuts, bringing you straight to the tab you need. The app has pleasant flat looks, and it's about the same as we remember it. It uses a tabbed interface - recent with dialer on the first and the contact list on the second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro supports voice call recording, and it can do it automatically on each call if you like. You can also assign an answer gesture, pre-define quick responses upon reject, there is even support for internet calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are even more call settings if you dig deeper into the menu - flip to mute the ringer, turn on/off the proximity sensor, lock automatically once slipped in a pocket, it can even mute calls from unknown numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro speaker scored a Good mark on our loudness test. Its sound quality was excellent with deep and crisp sound, and we think missed calls are unlikely in most environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro offers an excellent file managing app called Explorer, which lets you browse the files in its internal storage and groups them by type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MIUI v7 also offers a Security app. It can scan your phone for malware, manage your blacklist, manage or restrict your data usage, configure battery behavior, clean some RAM; it can also manage the permissions of your installed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mi Remote uses the IR blaster to control anything from TVs (including the Mi TV, of course) to digital cameras. The setup process is fairly simple and a handy option shares the remotes you've set up with others on the same Wi-Fi network. This means you'd have to go through the setup only once per home assuming everybody else uses a Xiaomi phone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom and now flat Calendar looks good, syncs with your accounts including Google, and offers Day and Month views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the standard sound recorder, notes, flashlight, calculator, clock, and weather apps, among others, that are a given in any self-respecting Android package nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the Compass app. It has very nice and clean interface, shows the magnetic directions and doubles as a level meter. If you lift the phone up, then you'll get a nice augmented reality view with real-time East/West/North/South overlay.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro comes with a custom Gallery app. It defaults to your camera roll, but it also supports Albums, Cloud, and People. The People sorting, once chosen, sorts all of your photos by people's faces. Everything is automatic. Here you can also create a new baby album, to put your newborn pics inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated editor offers various effects, frames, tools (crop, mirror, straighten, rotate, fisheye, doodle) plus light adjustments that let you bring out the shadows or the highlights.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The MIUI music player is a custom app with a well laid out, easy to navigate interface. It features two tabs - the first one is cloud music (not available everywhere), similar to Google Music service provided by Xiaomi while the second tab has your own local and cloud music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player has cool effects, transitions, and transparent elements, especially on the expandable Now Playing section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro offers customizable equalizers within the phone's Settings menu - there are a few default presets already available for use. You can also try Xiaomi's MiSound enhancer, which comes into play when you use headphones, and especially, a Xiaomi-branded headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An FM radio app is also available. The Redmi 3 Pro requires a headset to use as an antenna. FM recording is also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro features a separate video app, which offers a paid video service. Whether you will open your files from the Video app (Local setting) or File Explorer - it doesn't matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface is very basic, subtitles and pop-up play are not supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is very solid<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro had an excellent showing in the first part of our audio quality test. The affordable smartphone has loudness that?s higher than average and no weak points to its output whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headphones only damaged the stereo crosstalk, but it wasn?t too bad and volume remained better than we expected from a handset in this price range. The other readings remained great though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 13MP snapper with an LED flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro features the same 13MP camera as the Redmi 3's. It is equipped with a standard single LED flash. The snapper also features a hybrid autofocus system utilizing phase-detection for faster and more accurate focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is fairly simple and features toggles for the HDR mode, the flash and the video camera. It has three panes - the default one shows the viewfinder with a virtual shutter, flash trigger and front camera key. The top pane gets you a choice of 12 filters with live previews. The bottom one displays the advanced modes such as Panorama, Beautify, Scenes, and Manual as well as the camera settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro to perform very well regarding image quality. It snaps the photos very quickly, resolves above average amount of detail, and the noise levels are kept reasonably low. The white balance is accurate, and we like the lively color rendition. The dynamic range turned out average, but sometimes it managed to surprise us by capturing a lot of detail in the shadows without turning the HDR mode on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is conservative enough and rescues both the highlights and shadows without making the image look flat. Those aren't the best HDR photos we've seen, but are definitely among the better ones, and we liked all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama shots are available too. You can capture both landscape and portrait panoramic photos with a 180-degree field of view. Shooting is easy, but the stitching takes a while to complete. The result is rather disappointing, though - the resolution is about 2000x720px, and the image quality is quite poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro features a 5MP front-facing camera for high-res selfies. The images come out soft with average detail, but will do for Facebook or similar social networks. Their contrast turned out good, as were the colors and the dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro is more than capable of pulling its weight in our Photo Comparison tool. You can see how it stacks against other 13MP snappers we've tested.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro is capable of recording up to 1080p@30fps. The bitrate of the video recordings is uninspiring at about 15 Mbps while audio is captured at 96 Kbps with two channels (stereo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved detail in the videos is modest but enough for the class. We noticed some over-sharpening though. The colors and contrast are good, and the framerate is smooth and consistent at 30fps. The dynamic range is average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a 1080p video we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the 1080p video sample (11s, 21MB) taken straight off the Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here the Xiaomi Redmi 3 enters our video comparison tool. There are plenty of 1080p camcorders you can compare it against. It resolves an average level of detail, but contrast and colors are excellent.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You don't need two sequels to tell you how good the original Xiaomi Redmi 3 was. Yet, a Pro version and a 3s being launched within months of the base model are building on a solid base and will let Xiaomi continue to make good money off a solid yet very affordable midrange package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the memory upgrade, a fingerprint scanner and a touched-up exterior should be enough to warrant the Pro moniker. We won't argue with Xiaomi on that one considering the already great build and finish, solid battery life, reasonable screen and chipset quality of the original.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3 Pro has the same chipset as its predecessor but 3GB of RAM improves its multi-tasking capabilities and you get double the storage for apps and multimedia. The always-on fingerprint scanner is good enough, while the lightweight and highly-customizable MIUI is among the better launchers on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the bargain price Xiaomi is charging for the Redmi 3 Pro you'll be getting quite a robust smartphone of great build quality, respectable battery life, pleasant user experience and quality imaging. Here go our review highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can say it straight, the Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro is among the best options in its price bracket. It has everything we'd want in a midrange 5-incher and beyond. Sure, if you like to save some and yet get the same experience, you may want to try the original Redmi 3. If the Redmi 3s is instead available where you are, it's a virtually identical package with a less powerful but more recent CPU and a slightly better GPU for pretty much the same cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a growing number of competitors out there fighting for a chance, with rich features at a bargain price. The Meizu m3 is one of the biggest Redmi 3 rivals. It's also an all-metal device, with a 5" display, comparable processing power and camera capabilities. It doesn't have the same battery backup, but if you prefer Flyme over MIUI, you may want to check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is the Lenovo's Vibe K5 too with pretty much the same purpose as the Redmi 3 and m3. It's a 5" midranger and it packs pretty much the same hardware as the Redmi 3 Pro, except for the storage and battery juice. And no, it features no fingerprint scanner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of, it's near impossible to get one from an established brand either for this amount of cash. The Sony Xperia E5 for one will cost you a little more already, and other than the fingerprint unlock you'll lose the premium design, the big battery, and the high amount of RAM and storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo F1 may have been replaced with two new models already, but this doesn't make it any less attractive as an alternative to the Redmi 3 Pro. Oppo's all-metal phone is a very beautiful 5-incher, it runs on the same Snapdragon 616 chip, and features similar camera setup. Its battery is less impressive and no fingerprint scanner, but you may like the premium design and feeling the F1 has employed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there is the LeEco Le 1s which has a bigger and higher-res display, and even more powerful hardware. The Le 1s is very popular in China, but this is also the phone's undoing - the scarce availability outside its homeland. The Redmi Note 3 (MediaTek flavor) is pretty much the same as the Le 1s, but it has MIUI onboard and wider availability, so there is your bigger Redmi 3 right there if you need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get this but you'll have to give up on that... It's a thing you always need to deal with but it plays out great in the Redmi 3 Pro's favor. This midranger has specs that are hard to beat at a price that will make you laugh and cry. It's just doing what Xiaomi does best - tempt users and infuriate big-name brands in equal measures.</paragraph>
