			<paragraph>It wasn't that long ago that Samsung introduced the F480 at the MWC in Barcelona. Have you been keeping track of our articles since, you would probably remember how impressed we were with this fella. In fact, Samsung F480 was one of best handsets to debut at the event formerly known as 3GSM. Therefore we deem it unfair that it's stayed out of the spotlight till now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, we are about to fix that. An out-and-out review is in the making but the most impatient of our readers can get a taster with this preview summarizing our first impressions of the handset. It will sure fall short of answering all your questions about performance but a quick peek won't hurt, right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, check out some Samsung F480 photos - beauty ain't it? As it turns out, there won't be two different versions of the handset as Samsung claimed with the first announcement. Instead, the leather case that was supposed to enfold the second version comes as an accessory in the retail package. This way, all you need to do to switch from leather to case-free is replace the battery cover. That's where the leather case is attached so there's no other way of removing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We personally do appreciate the caseless version more but the more conservative user might think else. After all, the Samsung P-series earned quite a lot of fans for a good reason. So, no more small talk, let's get busy. We're back to the Samsung F480 ergonomics and construction after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung F480 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung F480 is definitely among the most compact phones on the market. Hardware controls have been kept to a minimum, shedding off a good deal of extra bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen has rendered Samsung F480 quite minimalist in terms of design and construction. The touch-based UI has removed the need of many hardware keys resulting in a handset standing at the very modest 95.9 x 55 x 11.5 mm. In reality you will have no problem slipping it in any pocket, no matter how tight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel is, quite naturally, dominated by the 2.8" display. The Samsung F480 screen is capable of showing up to 262K colors and supports QVGA resolution. The latter sounds like good news, given the widescreen resolution of Samsung F490, which we found to be not much of a treat. However, the disastrous sunlight legibility we are used to seeing in most Samsung handsets is also the case with the F480.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three keys under the display, all plastic with bronze-like finish. These are the call and end keys, with a confirmation key in the middle. When Samsung F480 is in standby, the confirmation key launches the shortcuts menu, which is similar to the Croix layout (think Samsung Armani, F490 and F700).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left of Samsung F480 we found the volume rocker and the microSD card slot. The volume rocker serves some interesting extra purposes across applications. For example it is used for changing the size of a web page in the web browser, which we found to be a very convenient solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of Samsung F480 features the universal connection port and the dedicated camera key. Once again Samsung are using an all-in-one jack for charging, transferring data and connecting accessories, with all its pros and cons. The camera key is rather stiff and difficult to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two things to note at the top of Samsung F480: the lanyard eyelet and the Hold button. The Hold button is used for locking the phone to avoid unwanted presses when you're carrying it. Unwanted presses are quite unlikely anyway, as the display reacts to fingertips only and doesn't respond to presses with other objects (stylus and the like).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The centerpiece at the back of Samsung F480 is the 5 megapixel camera lens. The camera didn't quite offer the performance we were hoping for, but a 5 megapixel shooter is always worth noting. Besides, our impressions are still too raw to judge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are delighted with the build quality of Samsung F480. The quality materials used, the classy brushed-metal look of the back and the solid feel are well worth the cheer. There was nothing, for the little time we spent with the handset, to raise construction or durability issues. The F480 easily pulls off those high-end looks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface is nicely upgraded<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung F480 features a new UI, with nice colorful icons. It is a welcome change as previous touch UI Samsung handsets we reviewed seemed a little too reserved. The other nice improvement to the interface is the addition of widgets. We did like the idea and we are glad the implementation didn't let us down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Widgets are basically a very convenient way for customizing your home screen. The Widget bar toggles on and off the homescreen by pressing the arrow in the lower left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Widget bar itself includes a number of icons, which can be dragged onto the display and ordered to the user liking. If any of them should become unwanted, they can easily be dragged back to the bar. Here is a quick video demonstration on how the whole widget thing works.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the actions throughout the menus also involve animations. We, for one, did find them very eye-pleasing and cool to work with. If we're to sum up the first impression of the user interface, we'd say it's downright fun to use. And it's by far the best looking and best performing Touch UI we've seen in recent handsets (save for the Apple iPhone of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player of Samsung F480 has also been improved and optimized for touch operation. It looks very cool but, in terms of functionality, is quite the same as with most other recent Samsungs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. You can also choose to play either the tracks you've recently listened to, or the ones that you've played the most. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlist. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widget responsible for controlling the music player is cool, allowing quick access to the full version of the application by a single click only. You can also start, stop and alternate tracks straight from the home screen if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a number of sound effects available when playing a track. Starting with surround, adding dynamic sound and finishing with some common equalizers (rock, jazz etc.), it's all there with Samsung F480. Not that we are such great fans of those sound effects but we still needed to mention them.</paragraph>

</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung F480 allows touch-performed fast forwarding and rewinding, as well as track rating. Add all those extras to the generous 228MB of internal storage and the memory card slot, and you get a great portable music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung F480 is also equipped with an FM radio with RDS. Again, it offers intuitive controls and it even has an integrated music recognition feature much like Sony Ericsson's TrackID. We tried it once and it returned the right result straight on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera performance at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, a camera with features like the one of Samsung F480 simply cannot go unnoticed. The camera interface has been altered in both looks and functionality. We find it to be the most convenient camera interface on a touchscreen device so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the widely advertised features on Samsung cameraphones are all here. Wide dynamic range, face detection, anti-shake, you name it. The face detection feature does not work nearly as smoothly as on Samsung U900 Soul but it's still good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is however somewhat of a letdown, at least as much as we are able to tell at this stage. A very strong red tint appears on the photos as a result of wrong white balance settings. We tried shooting at different white balance settings but none of the available options managed to get rid of the red tint. We are however quite sure that this will be fixed in the retail version of the handset as there is nothing easier than that. Another disadvantage of the camera is that it is on the slow side, taking about 5 seconds to save a picture. Here are some samples for a taster of the image quality the Samsung F480 manages to achieve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the image processing is quite nice and the noise levels are very low on most occasions. The dynamic range is also decent and highlights and/or shadow-clipping is rather rare to be seen. All in all we are safe to conclude that this is the best camera mounted on a phone with such modest dimensions. Here is how the two photos look when we corrected the white balance with a photo editing application. We also downsampled them to 1024 x 768 pixel to show how they would normally look on your desktop pc. No other changes have been made.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is superb<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We picked the web browser as the last Samsung F480 feature to highlight in this preview. It did impress us and we feel a pat on the shoulder is more than well deserved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser offers full screen and normal modes, as well as two view modes. The desktop page rendering makes the pages appear as on a common desktop PC. Its main problem is that, when reading text, you have to endlessly scroll around as it usually doesn't fit on the screen. The smart-fit mode however is an entirely different story. It makes the pages fit perfectly on the 2.8" QVGA screen and reading is vastly improved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing we really appreciated in the web browser is the usage of the volume rocker for changing page size. The sharp performance of that feature was what won our approving nods in the first place. The web browser of Samsung F480 also offers Page pilot - a nice kind of mini map that allows quick navigation of large and elaborate websites. Thumbs-up again for the smooth and fast performance, which is superior to most other touch-operated devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can scroll around by simply sweeping a finger across the screen. The movement is however rather illogical, as the page moves in the same direction as the sweep. We did prefer Apple's implementation, where the page moved in the opposite direction, as if you are actually pushing it to the side.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once again after the MWC, Samsung F480 did manage a good impression effortlessly. It is bound to give the Samsung Armani a good run for its money. We'd go even further and say there's little to stop the F480 from cannibalizing its haute couture parent. The Samsung F490 should also feel threatened, as its larger size (and by no means superior functionality) may be a good enough deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung F480 may not have the best camera around, but smooth handling and fun-to-use can be even more important than that. Sleek looks are essential too and the F480 has nothing to fear in that department. It also has the usability and customization opportunities to keep your interest for a long time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this stage we suffice to say that we prefer Samsung F480 to both F490 and the Armani. We are yet to see how well it will fare against the rest of the competition but odds are it has every chance of becoming one of the most successful Samsung models.</paragraph>
