		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Thinnest, lightest, highest water resistance - there are plenty of superlatives you can throw at the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet - prettiest is another, though that one's more subjective. What is certain is that Sony has crafted one of the best tablets of 2014.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original Xperia Tablet Z was already among the slimmest and most attractive we've handled, but Sony did even better with the Xperia Z2 Tablet. The slimmer waistline certainly improves the looks even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More importantly, the new tablet is 50g lighter than its predecessor. The Wi-Fi only version of the Z2 Tablet weighs just 426g, the LTE-enabled variant does 439g. In comparison, the Wi-Fi only versions of the iPad Air and the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 weigh 470g. The Xperia Z2 Tablet is a millimeter thinner too than those two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size and resolution of the display remain the same - 1,920 x 1,200 on a 10.1" diagonal - but sprinkled with more of Sony's Triluminos and X-Reality tech. The viewing angles are much improved compared to the earlier generation, which is great though we would've loved to see a bump in pixel density too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset is a bigger leap forward that puts the Xperia Z2 Tablet ahead of the competition - while flagship smartphones are adopting Snapdragon 801 chipsets, most tablets are still on Snapdragon 800. This should give the Z2 Tablet an edge in 3D graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also put a pair of front-facing stereo speakers to further improve the gaming experience, though these will come in handy when watching movies too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Water resistance is a big part of the Xperia Z identity and even goes up a notch in the Z2 Tablet. The IP58 certification means it can stay under 1.5m of water for half an hour. Specialized tablets aside, the Xperia Z2 Tablet and its predecessor are the only mainstream water-proofed tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet might prove to be better for Sony than even the Z2 smartphone - that one is embroiled in a three-way battle with the Samsung and HTC flagships, while Android tablets have no distinct opposition to the iPad. And the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet beats the iPad Air in several key points- both hardware and software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now jump to the next page to see the tablet getting a proper physical.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's not much to the retail box of the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet - the device itself, plus a compact charger and a microUSB 2.0 cable to go with it. The charger output is 1.5A, which is smartphone territory. Not that the Xperia Z2 Tablet has a huge battery, but still. As usual though box contents are market-dependent so you might get a different charger in your area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony uses the same design for its flagship phones and the Xperia Z2 Tablet - an aluminum skeleton that runs the perimeter of the device with a hollow center. This brings the benefits of a sturdy aluminum frame and enough room for internal hardware as the frame stays out of the way of components. Undoubtedly it has helped Sony to hit the stunning 6.4mm of thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the inside is technically impressive, the outside is visually impressive. It follows the OmniBalance design language with a small change - the back is matte, soft touch plastic instead of the usual glass. As we already mentioned, this change reduces weight and handles scratches better. The plastic can be rather tricky to clean when it gets smudgy, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feel in hand is a memorable experience - the Z2 tablet feels stunningly light for its size. It's impressively slim too - most devices use visual tricks to hide some of their depth (like sloped sides), but the Xperia Z2 Tablet has nothing to hide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unusually lightweight and thin body gives the Z2 Tablet a premium feel that most Android tablets lack, even the people's favorite iPad Air is outdone here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic on the back handles knocks and scratches better than glass, while the tempered, scratch-resistant glass on the front should take some beating too. With the IP58 water resistance rating, you may as well defy the instinct to handle the tablet with a light touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet is dominated by the screen, but a couple of other components are there too. They blend in almost seamlessly into the design, but if you look closer you'll spot two vertical notches on either side of the display - the stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are powered by Sony's S-Force surround sound tech and are positioned almost at the bottom of the front side. That's so you don't cover them with your palms when you hold the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, the bezels are perhaps our biggest complaint about the Xperia Z2 Tablet. We like bezels on tablets since they allow a good thumb purchase to comfortably hold that weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the side bezels in particular are unnecessarily big, especially considering how light the device is. The bezels also affect the device visually, making the 10.1" display look smaller than normal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display are the 2.2MP front-facing camera, an ambient light sensor and a status LED. It's in the right corner of the tablet and is so tiny we almost missed it at first. It's just a white LED, so it can't show color-coded notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the tablet features the IR blaster and a noise cancellation mic, plus two protective flaps. One covers the microUSB 2.0 port, the other the card slots. One is a microSD card slot to build on the base 16GB of storage, while the other slot is reserved for the microSIM card. If you have the Wi-Fi only version, that slot will be sealed off with a plug.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flaps are part of the water-proofing measures for the tablet and must be closed if the Xperia Z2 Tablet is to come into contact with water. The UI will prompt you to close any opened flaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can charge the tablet without plugging in a microUSB cable. You'll need a Sony charging dock that connects to the exposed pogo pins at the bottom of the tablet. If you have a high-end Xperia phone, it and the tablet can take turns on the dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also at the bottom of the tablet is the 3.5mm audio jack, though if you find that uncomfortable there's nothing stopping you from using the Xperia Z2 Tablet upside down (barring video calls).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the tablet features the trademark aluminum Power key and the volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the tablet is almost uninhabited save for the 8MP camera and NFC logo in the top right corner. The camera has no flash (not that we consider this an issue for tablets), while the NFC logo gives you something to aim for when pairing with other devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath is a 6,000mAh battery, the same capacity as the previous model. It's good that Sony managed to keep the capacity, while bringing the thickness down, but it's a bit small for a 10" tablet - similarly sized competitors have over 30% more juice in their batteries.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet has a 10.1" IPS LCD display of 1,920 x 1,200 pixel resolution. The pixel density works out to 224ppi, lower than the 264ppi of the iPad Air and the 299ppi of the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sharpness proves sufficient for tablet use, though we would still have preferred a resolution bump from the previous generation as there is some softness in the finer detail on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Sony has applied its TV making know-how with the unique Live Color LED tech, which uses blue LEDs and Red and Green phosphor instead of the usual white backlight. This combined with Triluminos provides even backlighting and deeper colors. Sony promises the screen is better than others at reproducing reds and aqua blues/emerald greens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Despite the unusual display tech, the Xperia Z2 Tablet uses a standard matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not just marketing talk either, the color rendering is indeed impressive and the viewing angles are incredibly wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility suffers quite a bit from the reflectivity of the screen - the glass just reflects too much of the surroundings, which can make it difficult to see what's happening on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware display features are enhanced by the X-Reality engine that analyzes photos and videos. It sharpens the outlines of objects to make them pop, enhancing color and contrast and applying noise reduction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has added a feature that lets you manually tune the white balance of the screen, but that can be difficult to get right. We would have preferred something simpler, i.e. just a selection of Cool / Neutral / Warm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A more helpful option is called Smart backlight controls, which is a reimplementation of Samsung's Smart stay. It prevents the screen from going to sleep as long as the front-facing camera can see your face.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have the Wi-Fi only version of the Xperia Z2 Tablet, but even the LTE version lacks voice call functionality so we could only do the web browsing and video playback tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6,000mAh battery doesn't sound like much, but Sony really managed to squeeze every available minute of battery life out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browsing time topped the chart, though that's with a rather dim display. You can read our blog post on the matter for more details.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playback time was pretty great too, but again it will drop significantly if you push the brightness near the maximum.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat with Sony's latest software. We say latest though with the company's minimal changes it can be hard to tell - along with Motorola, Sony has one of the thinnest skins over stock Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick tour of the interface on video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has moved away from multiple widgets and back to clean looks. All it shows is the time and a camera shortcut. Sony has enabled double tap to wake, so you don't even have to reach for the Power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is the familiar shortcuts and widgets affair. As usual, Sony offers Themes, which set the wallpaper and some of the system colors. There are several beautiful themes preloaded (plenty of wallpapers too) and you can download more from Sony Select.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is split in two, which is the norm for tablets. On the left you get all notifications, while the right side holds exclusively toggles. You can rearrange, hide and add toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The toggles don't quite work as expected, a long press displays an option to take you to the related settings (e.g. Wi-Fi settings for the Wi-Fi toggle) instead of just taking you there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet uses a customized app switcher. The first change is a Close all button, the other is Sony's Small Apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or use the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet is powered by Qualcomm's MSM8974AB Snapdragon 801 chipset. It's mostly identical to the Snapdragon 800 except the GPU is clocked about 30% higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most high-end Android tablets have Snapdragon 800, so the Z2 Tablet should have an edge in 3D graphics. Sony also put 3GB of RAM, while the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 has 2GB and the iPad Air has just 1GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the CPU clockspeed is untouched, the Xperia Z2 Tablet stays close to the S800 devices in the CPU tests, although the Linpack result is lower than expected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet also performs well in compound benchmarks like AnTuTu 4 and Quadrant. The extra RAM doesn't seem to be of much help in benchmark tests, but it will make a difference for real-world usage if you run many memory-intensive apps. Although Android reduced its memory footprint with KitKat, apps will only be getting more and more elaborate with time, so having 3GB RAM is good future-proofing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extra GPU performance clearly shows in the off-screen GFXBench tests, especially the new Manhattan test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBench 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet has a 1,920 x 1,200 screen, that's almost half the number of pixels on a 2,560 x 1,600 tablet. This pushes the tablet's on-screen advantage further and the Sony beats the Galaxy Tab Pro's (which have the higher resolution screens and lower-clocked GPU) by more than double in the Manhattan on-screen test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBench 2.7 T-Rex (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those benchmarks show very low framerates because they are designed to be as heavy as possible rather than playable. Epic Citadel at Ultra quality shows how a game with all settings on high should perform.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel (Ultra quality)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet has Chrome out of the box, the stock Android browser is not available. While desktop Chrome is a speed demon, the one on this tablet performs worse than Apple or Samsung's highly tuned browsers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has prioritized 3D performance with the Xperia Z2 Tablet and the results are excellent. The tablet has serious potential to be used as a gaming device, especially since it has Dualshock 3 controller support out of the box (more on that later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of overall performance, the Xperia Z2 Tablet is close to current flagship tablets, trading blows with them on the different tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet phonebook uses a split-screen interface - the contacts go on the left, individual details on the right. Contacts can come from multiple online services and there are fine-grained filters to avoid clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. The tablet can automatically find and suggest potential duplicates to be linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet features two loudspeakers on the front, flanking the screen. There are the usual Sony audio enhancements (Clear Stereo, Clear Bass, Clear Phase) plus the new S-Force surround sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also loudspeaker-specific options like xLOUD. We tested with all of them off, then with xLOUD on, but that made virtually no difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet manages only a Below Average score - we guess the waterproofing really took its toll as the two speakers were very quiet. Not that you need a loud ringer for incoming calls (there's no telephony), but the movie watching experience suffers from the quiet speakers too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet comes with Google Hangouts preinstalled to handle your instant messaging needs. The good thing about it is that you can chat with Hangouts users right inside Gmail or with a Chrome plugin. You can chat with multiple people and even do video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk. A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic Email app has been reskinned by Sony. It can handle POP and IMAP, do batch operations and offers a Combined inbox for all your email accounts (which Gmail does not).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia Z2 Tablet offers an on-screen full QWERTY keyboard with multiple customization options. It has three skins preinstalled and three different view modes - big, small and split keyboard. The last two float above the app and can be moved around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional options allow you to add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled. If you're going to enable auto correction, you might want to let the keyboard learn your writing style by reading your Gmail, Facebook, Twitter or messages you've sent (each of these can be used individually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also has a bespoke keyboard cover that measures 17.5mm thick when closed around the tablet. The keyboard pairs via NFC and connects over Bluetooth and can be used separately from the case itself (which doubles as a stand) or you can use it as a laptop of sorts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smooth gallery with great features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can resize the image thumbnails with a pinch gesture all the way from a grid of tiny, tiny thumbnails to a single image view. The Snapdragon 801 chipset breezes through the task with impressive speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a second tab here, My Albums, which includes online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) along with albums stored on devices in the local network. Alternatively, you can turn the Z2 Tablet into a DLNA server and view photos from the device on a computer or compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here are some special albums - Maps and Globe, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by where they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled. Albums can automatically scan a photo for faces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a SensMe-like mode for slide shows which, much like the music player feature, scans files and groups similar photos together.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTPC-style video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI, reminiscent of HTPC interfaces. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TV shows you have on the phone. It will even download posters, as well as movie metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this doesn't work very well for TV shows - it doesn't recognize the S01E02 format and won't pull info about individual episodes. It gets worse, Gracenote seems to be lacking info on TV shows in general, we couldn't find even popular shows like The Big Bang Theory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that Sony has fixed up its codec support and the Xperia Z2 Tablet plays just about everything - AVI (DivX, XviD), MP4 and even MKV. Just about. DTS, DD and AC3 audio are not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does support fully-customizable subtitles and gives you access to both sound effects (the same as the Walkman music player) and display settings (X-Reality, White balance and Brightness are of interest here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A special version of TrackID, TrackID TV, is available out of the box. As the name suggests, it can recognize what show is currently on or you can just check the TV guide. For each show or movie that's on you can view details, images, a cast list with photos and even tweets about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia devices. It has Music Unlimited integration and will try to sell you songs, but you can hide the Music Unlimited stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman interface is based on tiles that sort your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to link your Facebook account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Unlimited stuff includes ways to discover new music - Charts, New releases and Channels. Those can be hidden individually (same goes for the artist/album/playlist tiles) or you can disable the service altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen shows a carousel with the tracks in the current playlist and the usual music controls below that. You can swipe left and right to move between tracks. The Infinite button will help you find the music video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Thumbs up button that lets you post to Facebook directly from the music player or you can let it post automatically for you. You can also turn on a visualizer that flips album art images in 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art or you can edit it manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved the Walkman player's settings. There's the familiar ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic normalizer evens out the volume differences between tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements offer even more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). There's Surround sound mode too, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD boosts up the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The traditional TrackID is available here too, it needs a few seconds worth of a sample to tell you the name and the artist.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet features an FM Radio aboard, complete with RDS support. The app has multiple skins and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is good but somewhat quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet did quite well in the first part of audio output test. It demonstrated a somewhat quiet output and lower than most of its competitors, but it was a perfectly clean one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things were still looking good when we plugged in a pair of headphones, but the output wasn't quite so perfect. The stereo crosstalk increased quite a lot and some distortion crept in, although the latter is virtually undetectable to the naked ear. The volume remained pretty low, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera with many features, poor image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet uses an 8MP Exmor RS backside illuminated sensor. The 2MP front-facing camera has an Exmor RS sensor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is identical to that of Xperia phones and the feature set is almost the same too. The UI is essentially arranged in two viewfinder columns. The right one holds four virtual buttons: a shortcut to the gallery, a shutter key and camcorder button, and a shooting mode switch. Depending on the shooting mode you're in, the video shutter key may be replaced by a still/video mode toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The column on the left changes more substantially. In Manual mode you also get a "manual controls" shortcut here, which only offers an exposure compensation slider and a white balance selector. ISO and metering can be adjusted from the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a scene mode shortcut or you can let Superior Auto guess the scene automatically (it's really good at it). Proper color saturation, contrast, metering mode along with other settings are selected for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet camera offers a plethora of built-in features starting from the basics - geotagging, touch capture, face detection, smile shutter, burst shot mode and sweep panorama.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new feature straight from the Xperia Z2 smartphone is background defocus. You tap an area of the screen to set the focus, then the tablet snaps two shots and with calculations simulates a DSLR-like shallow depth of field. This mode failed to work so many times we almost gave up. It's not very precise but it can simulate motion blur and let you adjust the intensity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect. Children will love this mode, but left us, bitter adults, unimpressed - the resolution drops to 1080p and the graphics are unbecoming of a Snapdragon 801 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has also included a mode called Social streaming, which can live-stream the video feed from your camera directly to your Facebook profile. That's certainly not something you see every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Timeshift replaces the regular burst mode, it captures 61 shots in just 2 seconds. The intriguing thing is it starts shooting even before you've pressed the shutter button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool thing about the new camera is that it features Lens-like functionality - you can tap the + Apps button and download additional modes for the camera. This includes plugins for Vine, Evernote, a PDF scanner, an alternative panorama mode, additional image effects and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet packs an 8MP camera but the results are of a lower grade than the pixel count would suggest. First we tried Superior Auto, which was the best mode on the recent Xperia Z phones. The images have a highly over-processed look - their contrast is boosted too high, the sharpening is much too strong, noise reduction smears actual detail and yet there's still visible noise (the strong sharpening brings it back out).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Normal mode shots come out better, mainly because the contrast curve isn't as extreme and the sharpening is notably toned down. Images are still noisy and low on detail, but still better than Superior Auto. Unfortunately, even in manual mode there are no settings to change the contrast and sharpening, so you're still mostly relying on automatic adjustments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On Xperia Z phones, Superior Auto usually does well in backlit scenes, but not on the Xperia Z2 Tablet. The dedicated HDR mode doesn't seem to add much to either highlights or shadows, but it drops the contrast noticeably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped a couple of macro shots with the tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We shot the charts with Normal mode after we determined it affects image quality less than Superior auto. The results are not great, but then the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 is noticeably worse. The Apple iPad Air has a 5MP shooter, but it offers very good image quality (for a tablet).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording done in 1080p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet is capable of capturing 1080p video at 30fps and that's about it. The camcorder app UI is practically the same as the still camera's. You can set a timer and fiddle with settings like exposure, metering, focus mode, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For videos the Z2 Tablet features a proprietary SteadyShot digital image stabilization, but there's a price to pay - the field of view (FoV) is reduced (it's how digital stabilization works). The phone is smart enough to detect whether you are shooting hand-held or you have rested it on something stable but you get the reduced FoV either way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go into video mode from the Manual shooting mode, you get an actual HDR setting and scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also snap stills during video recording but that's not of much use as you only get 1080p images, you might as well grab a frame from the video. Also note that the image processing is different than still shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet is a reasonably powerful camcorder. It captures 1080p videos at just under 30 frames per second with a good bitrate of 17-18Mbps and stereo sound recording at a bitrate of 128Kbps and 48kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end results are pretty good, surprisingly. The image is not the sharpest, but there's good detail, the color rendering looks okay, there's no excessive noise and the videos are smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The continuous autofocus is much too eager and triggers all the time (it does on Xperia phones too), even when there's barely anything in front of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR video mode is available but that forces the resolution to 720p and this mode doesn't do much in terms of expanding the dynamic range.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity excels at entertainment functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet comes in two flavors - Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi + LTE. The latter has quad-band 2G and penta-band 3G connectivity across all regional models. It also supports more LTE bands than you can shake a stick at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE is Cat. 3 meaning it can theoretically reach 100Mbps of downlink and 50Mpbs uplink. Outside LTE coverage, the Z2 Tablet is rated for mobile data speeds of up to 42Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have the Wi-Fi only version and an Xperia phone with a data plan, you can use Xperia Link to share the phone's internet connection over Bluetooth (which uses less power than a Wi-Fi hotspot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're experiencing connectivity problems, the Wi-Fi checker app can try and detect issues with the connection. We're not sure if this app will see much use, but it's there if you need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use it with the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP, which can be used for low-power accessories (e.g. sports trackers). There is also support for the ultra-low power ANT+ connectivity protocol, which is usually used for connecting to various sports accessories such as heart rate monitors or bicycle speed &amp; cadence meters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet features NFC too, but there's no app to handle the NFC functions out of the box. Luckily, there are plenty of capable NFC apps in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles charging and PC connectivity, and there's also USB On-the-go support, so you can attach external flash drives as well. The MHL-enabled microUSB port also supports HDMI connections to an external monitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A rarer feature is MirrorLink - it uses the USB cable to connect to a car's multimedia system and display a custom UI, plus you can access the basic functions with the car's usual controls. The Z2 Tablet is perhaps too big to be your in-car accessory, but it's certainly possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if you're going to use the tablet at home, the IR blaster will come in handy. It can control a wide range of devices - anything from VCR through Wi-Fi wireless speakers to TVs, disc players and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can also learn new control codes from an existing remote if something isn't working. Plus you get to record macros to handle multiple actions on multiple devices - if you need to fire up the TV, the HTPC, the amp and other devices, the Xperia Z2 Tablet can do it all in a single tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet itself can serve as an entertainment center - we already looked at the HTPC-like video player, but you can also connect a Dualshock 3 controller from a PlayStation 3 and play games (with the tablet on a dock or hooked up to a TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have a PlayStation 4, you can use the PlayStation app to connect to it and chat with friends, get alerts and notifications, pick and download games for the PS4 from the tablet and even use the tablet as a second screen if the game supports it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, replacing the former LiveWare manager. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger, or during a time interval (e.g. mute alarms at night). It doesn't work with NFC tags though, which is very disappointing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unmatched browsing with Google Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box, skipping the generic Android browser altogether. Chrome's now powered by the Blink rendering engine (a fork of WebKit), so underneath the minimalist UI it's still the same as desktop Chrome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. A mic icon allows you to dictate a query instead of typing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on handheld. It also syncs your tabs and bookmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs, which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Incognito tabs, which let you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with the settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An Opera-like feature, Reduce data usage, does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone. You can check the graph to see how much data you've saved. Unlike Opera Mini, this mode keeps the full functionality of web pages. Also, secure connections bypass the Google servers for privacy reasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet features a second browser, the Small app browser, which lets you surf while doing other things. You can hit Open in another app to view the page in Chrome, but there's no easy way to switch from Chrome to the floating browser. Also, there's a Chrome Bookmarks small app that just shows your bookmarks (i.e. it's not a small app version of Chrome).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet comes with the OfficeSuite 7 Pro document editor, which handles viewing, creating and editing of Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. It can also view PDFs. The interface is clutter-free but there are still plenty of features (font formatting, formulas, you name it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has been reskinned by Sony to match the looks of the other native apps, and there's been some new functionality added. The calendar displays the weather forecast for each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. The calendar can also display the national holidays for a long list of countries and your contacts' birthdays too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm &amp; clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own sound and repeat pattern. You can also set whether the side buttons would snooze the alarm, dismiss it or do nothing. There's also a desk clock option and a world clock (which shows the weather forecast for each city, not just the time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's own Socialife News is a news reader that pulls headlines from web sites and RSS feeds. If you sign into Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, the app will include updates from those services as well. The app repackages the article in an easy to read format with selectable font sizes to make reading a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sketch is pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note/sketch and just start typing or doodling. You can customize a wide variety of drawing modes, backgrounds, and stencils. You can use the app to draw a sketch to send with the Messaging app and there's even Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to edit photos rather than draw, Pixlr Express is available out of the box. It has a ton of image editing options for individual photos, but can also create highly customizable collages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big, too big, and it also offers advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more. What about Stamina mode?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File Commander app (by the same devs as OfficeSuite) is a capable file manager that features batch operations, ZIP file support and cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, SugarSync, SkyDrive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has added its own Backup &amp; Reset feature for Android OS. It works for apps you've uninstalled and then reinstalled again, all of your multimedia content is saved too, and all system apps such as messaging, call logs, etc. get their data stored safely. Restoring is easy so you can easily bring back anything you may've lost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to keeping your data safe, the ability to delete everything and lock the tablet if you lose it shouldn't be underestimated. My Xperia will help you locate the Z2 Tablet on a map, make it sound an alert (if you just lost it somewhere at home) and lock and erase private info if you cannot get to it. Just make sure you've backed everything up off device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another helpful tool is the Update center, which checks for updates for your device and your apps. You can enable automatic download with the option to only do it over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet has a built-in A-GPS receiver with GLONASS support, which managed to get a lock in about a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network estimation, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps offers voice-guided navigation in an ever-growing list of countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycle and public transport (this one is more limited in availability). Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you do decide to use the Xperia Z2 Tablet for in-car navigation, remember to check if your car's head unit supports MirrorLink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but its coverage is expanding and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Garmin's Navigon app is also available out of the box, so you can use that if you prefer it over Google Maps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store, Sony stores<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store content is arranged across several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. You can also check out the Play Picks, Apps to Watch, Apps Highlights and Editor's Choice categories on the Home tab for more curated app lists. The Recommended for you list is based on what apps you've installed and what your Google+ friends have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps have several screenshots (many even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other "stores" will be useful in finding cool apps - Sony Select and What's New. We put stores in quotes since those two only help with discovery but will open the web browser to actually download the item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Lounge app promises to deliver exclusive multimedia content (music, film and sports), promotions and games. The items tagged with VIP are exclusive, but you'll need to answer a trivia question for some of them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has a long history of excellence in hardware design and the Xperia Z2 Tablet is a testament to that. It took the company a few generations to refine the OmniBalance body but the results speak for themselves - no other tablet is this thin or light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We keep repeating "thin and light" over and over, but it's not something that can quite be put into words. It has practical applications of improving portability, but the biggest effect is on the in-hand feel - the elegance and character of a premium product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing we are not perfectly happy with is the screen. Don't get us wrong, it's a very good display with stunning colors and very wide viewing angles great, but it's quite reflective (damaging experience outdoors and when bright light sources are present) and the resolution could have been higher. The side bezels are also not our favorite thing about the Xperia Z2 Tablet, but we guess Sony was working with limited internal volume and couldn't help it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water resistance is thus far unique to Sony's tablet (aside from a few low-volume offerings). You will not be using a tablet by the pool, in the tub or in the kitchen every day but the Xperia Z2 Tablet is certainly not an at-the-couch only experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also appreciate the small touches like the front-facing stereo speakers (even if they are rather quiet), NFC and a learning IR blaster. Sony's set of connectivity options certainly improve the tablet's standing against its competition, and the tight PS4 integration will help win the hearts of keen gamers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 is light for a 10" tablet, but it's still a good 50g heavier than the Xperia. It's also a bit behind on processing power, but what it does have going for it is the sharper screen and Samsung's proprietary split-screen multitasking, which really takes productivity up a notch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you need a digital stylus, you can go for the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition), though that's 100g over the Xperia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 LTE ? Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other obvious contender is the Apple iPad Air. With a sleek metallic body, it's certainly more competitive in terms of looks than the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1, but again it's 50g heavier. It has a sharper screen than the Sony and a far larger number of tablet-optimized apps. However, keep in mind that non-expandable storage is a hidden extra cost - 16GB is not enough for a phone, let alone a tablet and Apple is charging dearly if you want to go higher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad Air</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony offers a hardware keyboard accessory, but if typing experience is what you're after than the Asus Transformer Pad TF701 has been designed from the ground up to work as an ultrabook. It has a sharper, brighter screen than the Xperia Z2 Tablet and a metallic back. It is considerably thicker and heavier though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Transformer Pad TF701T</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 Tablet has a good Office suite out of the box, but if you need closer integration with Microsoft's Office and its other services, then the Nokia Lumia 2520 and Microsoft Surface 2 have an edge. Windows RT also plays nice with PlayStation 4's opponent, the Xbox One. They are no match in the "thin and light" department though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Microsoft Surface 2 ? Nokia Lumia 2520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony did a lot of things right with the Xperia Z2 Tablet, but it's the hardware design that puts it head and shoulders above the competition. Sony's custom software is among the best designed with a number of standout features, but the rich Play Store can get other tablets close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This brings us back to the hardware - the Z2 Tablet has an air of exclusivity about it, reminiscent of Sony's heyday. At equal pricing, it feels like the Xperia is giving you more bang for the buck than the competitors listed above.</paragraph>
