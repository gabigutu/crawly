			<paragraph>One thing we know about the LG KF750 Secret is that it's hard to resist. The handset seems to have it all - turn-head exterior, top-notch skill and a few exotic extras to spice things up. Looks have long been the defining feature of the Black Label series by LG. Now, the Secret brings some muscle to tip the form vs. content scale the other way. LG Secret packs a 5 megapixel camera, slow motion and Fast video recording, carbon fiber battery cover and tempered glass over the display. The other highlights are the Neon Touch Navigation and Touch media navigation. So, there we go with keeping it a secret.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we see it, the bitterest market rivals of LG KF750 Secret will be Sony Ericsson C902 and the Samsung U900 Soul. While none is a match for the video recording capabilities of the LG KF750, each of the 5 megapixel cameraphones has some unique feature to flaunt. With the Cybershot, it's the advanced camera handling with touch controls, and the Soul boasts 7.2 Mbps HSDPA and 16M-color screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the Secret is likely to get some pressure too from a proven performer within the very LG family. The LG KU990 Viewty pulls off the same VGA videos at 30fps and even has the slow motion recording. What it lacks is the time lapse capture, plus it's quite thicker than the LG Secret.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, potential buyers should also consider the Samsung F480. It may not boast the same feature pack as the LG Secret but it has the sweet TouchWiz interface up his sleeve. It is also even more compact than the KF750.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG KF750 Secret 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Standing at 102.8 x 50.8 x 11.8 mm LG KF750 Secret is among the compact sliders (and the other form factors as a matter of fact) on the market. The less than 12 mm thickness is impressive enough given the features it packs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 116 grams is more of a compliment considering the high-quality materials used. In fact, the weight does benefit the handling of the LG Secret.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Cliche though it may be, the Black Label series LG KF750 Secret is dressed to impress. As far as we are concerned, there's hardly anything wrong with the design of the handset. The glossy front panel looks really classy and so does the carbon fiber and leather-like surface at the back. The metal frame around the front panel is another sleek ornament.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all fairness, some of the members of our team weren't that impressed with design. It is obvious that the carbon-fiber battery cover doesn't go that well with the rest of the surfaces and contrast is too much for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece of LG KF750 Secret is centrally placed near the upper edge of the front. Next to it are the video-call camera and the ambient light sensor. The latter allows the device to automatically adjust display brightness to its current environment and thus save precious battery life. It can also be switched off, should the user find it unnecessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the earpiece is the LG KF750 Secret's display, which will be discussed a little latter in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the display is the rather exotic navigation solution of the LG Secret - the Neon Touch navigation pad. It basically is a touch-sensitive pad with only the confirmation center, being a regular press key. There are also some nice illuminations to enhance the navigation experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, the problems we encountered with our first LG KF750 Secret unit, which we previewed, are now gone. The two context keys are now clearly marked and pose no problems to usage. Now, that's one beta issue solved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only possible inconvenience of the Neon touch navigation is that the combination of hardware and touch sensitive keys can be really confusing to some. Nevertheless, once you get the hang of it, you will realize that it is a really smooth and fun way to control the phone. Once again LG have put fun-to-use high on their list of priorities with the Secret.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding LG KF750 Secret open reveals the alphanumeric keypad, which will also receive its due attention in in the relevant chapter of the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing but the mouthpiece at the bottom of LG Secret. The top is also very plain, with no functional elements whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the handset we find the universal USB port and the lanyard eyelet. The USB port is hidden under a plastic lid so the looks aren't damaged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four keys on the right side of the handset. They include a volume rocker, the touch media key, the shortcut menu key and the camera button. All of those are large enough and easy to use. The touch media key is used to turn the touch sensitivity of the display on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of LG KF750 Secret features the 5 megapixel camera, the LED flash and the AF assist light. The AF assist light is really of help when shooting in dark environments. The LED flash however isn't powerful enough so, unless you're taking a photo of a close object or shooting video, it won't be of much value.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned the battery cover is made of carbon fiber and it looks really well (at least to some of us). By the looks of it, you might expect some rough surface, but it actually feels like glass to touch. That way touching it harmonizes nicely with the front panel which is entirely covered by glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are very pleased with the battery cover release mechanism of LG KF750 Secret. You only need to press the key below the cover and it pops up. When you fit it back on, a distinct click verifies the piece has locked in its proper position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the carbon fiber back cover of LG KF750 Secret lies the 800 mAh Li-ion battery quoted at 260 hours of stand-by time and 4 hours of talk-time. In reality it gives you slightly less than two days of intense usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card slot is also under the battery cover but as opposed to the LG Viewty you don't have to remove the battery to access it. Not the most comfortable location you can think of, but with the smart opening mechanism we just described, it might not be such a big issue. Besides, it really improves the looks of the Secret.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to the official LG web site, the KF750 Secret can only handle memory cards of up to 4GB. However, we had absolutely no problems using a 8GB microSD card with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are delighted with the build quality and handling of LG Secret. The top notch materials used do make a difference. The rather heavy weight, considering the otherwise compact size, makes the handset a pleasure to hold and control.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display for a rainy day<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF750 Secret has a 2.4" display of QVGA resolution. Picture quality is excellent, with pleasing contrast and brightness levels. As already mentioned, brightness can be automatically controlled thanks to the built-in ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy panel over the display is in fact tempered glass - that's a hardened glass with increased impact and scratch resistance. It probably won't do much good if you slide the KF750 along your floor tiles, but it should protect it from the regular daily tear-and-wear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news about the display is legibility under direct sunlight. The glossy front surface may be nice looking but it renders the phone impossible to use outside on a sunny day. Even the LG KU990 Viewty performs much better in this aspect, and you know we weren't really pleased with it either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad up to the task<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of LG KF750 is quite pleasing. It has ample and well defined buttons with enough space in between, so mispresses are quite unlikely. The press feedback is also good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand the keys are too flat so, until you get used to this, you will have some problems locating them by touch only. We bet however that once you get used to it, you will speed your way through endless lines of messages and notes with the LG KF750.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KF750 keypad has nice and even backlighting. Topped with the touch pad illuminations, the Secret has awesome looks in the dark. The backlighting is also strong enough to make sure usability won't suffer in dark environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF750 Secret offers smooth and problem-free performance when it comes to the most essential element of a phone - making calls. It offers good reception and in-call sound, with pleasing voice quality on both ends of a call. Besides, the phone has nice interface and dialing a number or a contact from the phonebook is quick and easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also put the Secret to our traditional loudspeaker test. Here is how it ranks against some of the other handsets exposed to the same challenge. As you can see, it performs greatly, stacking just below the top of our table. You can find more information about the test itself and the whole list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF750 Secret features the regular LG user interface. It scores high on visual appeal and user-friendliness. The menu looks are widely customizable making the fast and responsive device a pleasure to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen has information about the current time and date, as well as the typical status readings. It shows signal strength, the active profile and the battery status. In standby mode the touch pad features 4 shortcuts, which can be customized to best suit the user's needs. Each of those is attached to one of the directions, while the center is responsible for entering the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu structure of LG KF750 Secret is straightforward and easy to work with. Except for a few strangely placed settings, everything else makes perfect sense. The different files and features are exactly where you would expect them to be, even if you don't have much experience with LG handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch pad is the main option for navigating the menus. There are even settings for the haptic feedback and illuminations. As a whole, the feedback was good enough, albeit a bit delayed at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use keypad shortcuts, with alphanumeric keys linked to icons in the grid (depending on the menu). We didn't have any trouble navigating the phone for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch media scores a point</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really cool part of the LG KF750 Secret interface is the Touch media menu. It is enabled by pressing the dedicated key on the right side of the handset. It is the only menu where you actually get to use the touchscreen capabilities of the KF750.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We simply can get it why LG decided to limit the functionality this way. We guess that they should have re-redesigned the whole UI so that it can be thumb-optimized but still it's something within their powers. With all the hardware at hand it just doesn't make much sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the point - the Touch media grants you instant access to the music player, picture gallery, document viewer, FM radio and the M-toy application. Those are all features that can be launched via the regular menu but when accessed with Touch media they have different interface. It is optimized for easier touch operation. We have to note that the touchscreen only reacts to finger-touch so it's fool-proof against accidental presses in your pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Far-reaching customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF750 Secret has quite a number of customization options for appearance. There are two pre-installed themes - the simple and classy black and a more playful white. Bizarrely enough, the menu view modes are different for the different themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black theme offers the traditional grid menu style and a 3D rotation. That second one might be a bit more eye-pleasing but the first definitely wins on usability. The white theme has the grid and list view modes to pick from. It's kinda strange that the view mode depends on the theme but nonetheless we appreciate the looks of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can also alter the menu font style and the dialing style.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook in LG KF750 Secret has nice all round functionality and stores up to 1000 entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to display the numbers on SIM, in phone memory or both simultaneously. Contacts can be ordered by first or last name and you can decide whether the caller ID pictures should also be displayed in the phonebook. Naturally, there is searching by gradual typing. What's even better, both first and last names are searched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum available fields when editing a contact on the LG K750 Secret are 18, including 5 phone numbers. There are very few things missing in the list. You can save a note, along with a personal photo and a ringtone as well as 2 email addresses, URLs, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, LG KF750 Secret features the well-known grouping. This means that contacts can be organized in groups for easier management.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF750 Secret can handle all of the most common type of messages: SMS, EMS, MMS and email. We aren't really the biggest fans of the handset's messaging department but we still believe it's capable enough on most occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first three message types share a common editor. All you need to do to switch between them is insert some multimedia content - like a photo or audio track for example. The editor itself has rather basic looks and that's one thing we weren't particularly fond of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a counter showing the number of symbols remaining to the limit of 160. When that limit is exceeded, the editor turns another page, which should act as an indication that the message will be sent in two chunks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact that all messages share an editor on the LG KF750 Secret has a somewhat negative impact on user-friendliness. Now all sorts of unneeded options pop in the way when you are trying to send a simple SMS message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is quite easy to work with and mailboxes can be set up in no time. The big downer here is the lack of SSL support. It makes some very popular mail providers impossible to use with LG K750 Secret. For example, we were unable to set up a Gmail account on the handset's native email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KF750 however is supposed to come with a Google apps package, which would allow access to Gmail's mailbox via a simple Java app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MMS and email are saved in the reserved part of the phone memory, so you can have quite a number of them stored in you device. Normally, there is more than enough free storage available for that purpose but this depends on quite a number of factors. SMS storage has its capacity fixed to 1000 items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So generally, as far as the most common messaging needs are concerned, the LG KF750 is a passable performer. We do feel that some improvements are needed in future LG handsets if they are to be considered serious messaging devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on LG KF750 Secret won our appreciation with user-friendliness and good performance. It sorts tracks by three different filters - artist, album and genre. You can also create your own playlist if you like. The player offers nice visualization options including Album art and equalizer bars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 7 equalizer presets on LG KF750 Secret. Unluckily, neither can they be modified, nor new ones created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch media alternative of the music player has more modest capabilities and quite different looks. It is optimized for touch operation and with the large controls most of the options had to be sacrificed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music can be enjoyed on LG KF750 Secret with the FM radio too. Its interface is rather simple and generally very easy to work with. There is an auto scan feature that locates every radio station in your area and offers to save it. LG report that the FM radio player should have RDS support however on our test unit it was nowhere to be found - we shouldn't forget that our unit is a pre-release one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF750 Secret was quite a surprise with the great readings we were getting in our audio quality test. There is very little we can criticize about the audio reproduction skills of the newest Black Label handset. It easily outperforms all its fashion-centered siblings and ranks among the best devices we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now don't get us wrong - we have seen a couple of mobile phones do even better than the Secret but the margin is quite thin. As you can see from the table, even a dedicated portable music player like the Apple iPod doesn't score that much better than the KF750.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, have a look and judge for yourselves. If you want to learn more about the whole audio-quality testing process hit the link.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>DivX ready video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is one of the highlights of the Secret. It supports MPEG and even DivX video, which is quite a rarity among non-smartphones on the market. This means that you can upload .avi videos straight to your LG Secret without having to convert them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can be played fullscreen with no overlays to make the whole display usable. The built-in accelerometer is also put to use here automatically rotating the videos when you turn the phone. With the nice user interface, and the large number of supported formats, the LG KF750 Secret has every chance of becoming a fully capable portable video player. Well, a bit larger display would've made things even better but let's not get carried away.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management rapidly improving<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>File management is greatly improved in LG KF750 Secret compared to the latest LG handsets we have recently reviewed - LG KF510 and LG KF600. We have the same rather illogical file-type based organization, but at least user-created folders can now be handled hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the functionality has also gotten better - copying, moving and deleting single or multiple files at a time is now enabled. New folders can be created throughout the file manager and files can be instantly sent via MMS, email or Bluetooth. There are even built-in clients for uploading pictures straight to your blog at blogger.com and videos to YouTube.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Praiseworthy Galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of LG KF750 Secret excels in both functionality and user-friendliness. In fact there are two gallery applications - one accessible through the My stuff icon in the main menu and another via the Touch media menu. The first offers two view modes: thumbnail with 9 thumbs on screen, and list view with only 7 file names with tiny thumbs displayed. No wonder we liked the first one better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single pictures can be viewed in both landscape and portrait mode, and can also be displayed fullscreen. You can also zoom in to see further detail. Be warned that the zooming is on the slow side and if you have to do too much of if it might just get too annoying. On the other hand we are pleased with the panning speed and as well as with the overall speed of LG KF750 Secret in general when handling multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of this gallery include picture sorting (by name, date or type) and slide show. In all fairness, we aren't really impressed with the slide show capabilities of LG KF750 Secret. It doesn't play any music and the transition effects are nothing special.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Media photo gallery is even cooler. Again it makes use of the built-in accelerometer and automatically rotates the displayed photo but the touchscreen functionality also improves the user-interface as now quick zooming is done by simply sliding the zoom bar with your finger. It also feels much faster than the regular gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn't like about LG KF750 Secret touch media gallery is the limited options available when looking at a single picture. There is only one key in addition to the zooming and back keys, and it is used for setting the currently selected picture as wallpaper. This can get rather annoying, as the icon isn't very clear so you might end up changing your homescreen a bit easier than you would have wished.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sweet 5 megapixel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF750 Secret flaunts a 5 megapixel camera with auto focus. It also sports face detection, AF assist light and LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface uses the same black and white color scheme as the one found on the LG KU990 Viewty. The features included are also quite similar but organized differently. The lack of touchscreen functionality in the camera interface leaves you with the touch pad as the only option for getting around. As a whole, we are pleased with the interface, never mind a few minor flaws here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 7 different scene modes for shooting with the LG KF750 Secret: Auto, Portrait, Landscape, Night, Beach, Sports, and Party. In addition it offers the exciting ISO 800 we first saw on the Viewty. Have in mind though, that photos produced at this sensitivity aren't really usable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The commendable quality of the sample pictures made with the Secret inspired us to run an impromptu shootout with the LG Viewty. We hoped the comparison was to help us judge the picture quality of the Secret more precisely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have been keeping track you would know that we really like the photos produced by the Viewty. However, all of them had two major problems - the general red tint and the purple fringing in high-contrast areas. Seeing the photos made with the Secret we are more than pleased to conclude that both problems are completely eliminated, for which LG get a well deserved pat on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some issues concerning the photo quality of the KF750. The first thing we noticed is that although the color rendering is good, saturation is too high. This means that even dull scenes can produce punchy photos, but color rendering problems are likely with lively colorful scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is also obvious that LG have used a very aggressive noise reduction technique with the Secret. The new processing produces photos with much less noise, but eradicates all fine detail from the photos. For example - you have virtually no chance of making a good photo of sand or foliage with the LG KF750 Secret.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really interesting thing we noticed about KF750 is that it is has very little highlights clipping. The handset would normally choose to underexpose a picture with extreme contrast rather than lose the highlights. This is really good news if you plan to edit your pictures later on a PC, because more information is preserved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the samples from the shootout between the LG KF750 Secret and the LG KU990 Viewty that we conducted. On each row the photo on the left is produced by the LG KF750 Secret's camera, while the one on the right is made with the LG KU990 Viewty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> This crop clearly shows that the annoying purple fringing is completely eradicated from the Secret's photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Two things become obvious here: The more precise red color of the Secret and the aggresive noise reduction technique that has resulted in less detail in the foliage</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, LG KF750 Secret produces great photo results. Putting such a capable camera module in such a thin and compact device is a commendable effort. The Secret is close enough to some of the best 5 megapixel cameraphones out there and that should really count for something.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording in the spotlight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It is quite clear that the Secret is keen on video. Like the LG KU990 Viewty it can manage VGA videos at 30 fps and slow-motion QVGA at the sweet 120 fps. The Secret even takes that extra step by adding Fast videos. Those are actually the well-known time-lapse movies - seen in many digicams - but this is the first time we find them on a mobile handset. The best part is that all the video files are encoded as DivX AVI files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we are not sure about is why LG decided to limit the Fast video resolution to QVGA only. Taking those time-lapse videos requires less powerful hardware than even the regular 30 fps ones. The simple math suggests the handset needs to capture 8 times less information than when shooting a normal video clip. Therefore we doubt it the Secret will have any hardware trouble recording at least VGA videos (we are even thinking HD).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still those videos are primarily meant for fun and maybe LG decided that QVGA is enough for the purpose. Well one thing is for sure - they take far less space this way, but giving people the right to choose seems the better solution to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the video samples we made in the different modes. Maybe it's about time you got rid of your old camcorder?</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can also check out our LG KF750 Secret preview for a few more fast motion videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KF750 Secret slow motion video sample</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately our beta unit of LG KF750 Secret has some kind of problem with the slow motion videos, causing some irritating interruptions. However, this problem is sure to be solved in the retail version of the handset. If you want to see what the slow motion videos look like you can go and check our LG KU990 Viewty slow motion video samples here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: All aboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity options of LG KF750 Secret are enough to suit almost any taste. For starters, USB v2.0 works great and even grants access to the phone's internal memory in data storage mode. The problem here is that the phone is unusable for calls and messaging during a USB connection to PC, which might be inconvenient at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is also version 2.0 and has the A2DP profile supported. We had no problem pairing our unit with a third party headset, so compatibility issues don't seem probable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as network connectivity is concerned, the phone features GPRS and EDGE, topped with 3G. HSDPA comes as a welcome bonus to make sure the Secret is well geared in terms of fast data transfers. Finally we've got the hot-swap memory card slot. On some occasions it might turn out the easiest (and fastest) way of transferring data from and to your LG KF750 Secret.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser is good, we've seen better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are pleased with the LG KF750 web browser. It offers good page rendering and even the most elaborate web pages have little trouble fitting on the screen. Plus, with the optimized rendering mode text is even easier to read. The downside is that the page no longer looks as if browsed on PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser of LG KF750 also has a virtual mouse pointer that jumps between links. However, just like the one on LG KF600, the mouse pointer moves rather illogically, which can become irritating on more complex pages. You can hardly foresee its next step when a lot of links are placed close together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise the phone is doing great. In addition to the rendering mode setting there are also settings for caching web pages and accepting cookies. Finally, you can disable images to save some traffic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and applications have evolved<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer is another improved part of LG KF750 Secret in comparison to the LG KF510 and KF600. It now has better time-management capabilities, and the applications offer user-friendly interface and a lot of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers daily, weekly and monthly view modes and three different events available for setting. Those are: anniversary, birthday and appointment, and each of them has its own unique fields. Naturally alarms can also be set up to remind you of the event at a given time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF750 Secret also features a really advanced alarm clock application. It handles up to 5 different alarms, each with its own name, ringtone and repeat interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also three ways to make memos on your KF750: Memo, secret memo and voice recorder. The secret memo allows you to protect your notes with a password, while the voice recorder can come in handy for making audio memos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting but questionably useful organizer application is the Date finder. It can instantly tell you what day of the week any given date will be. It can also tell you the date after a given number of days. So if you are wondering what date it will be 90 days after today you can check that out at the expense of only a few clicks with the Secret. Now here comes the question of how often one would need such information but let's say it doesn't hurt having this application for punctuality's sake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator offers a good number of functions. Navigating it is also very nice and easy with the touch pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock application is a nice little helper that can tell you the current time in any time zone. In terms of layout and graphics it's really great and it also has an extremely large database of cities for each region and time zone. The only thing missing is a search option to make selecting a location easier but that's something we can live with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next in line is the built-in Picsel document reader. It is capable of handling all popular document formats - .xls, .doc and .pdf - and once again can be accessed from two different menus. When you launch it from the Touch media menu, it is touch operated and we find this much more convenient, especially when browsing larger documents. In addition, it has nice interface and good functionality. Add the great speed and you'll understand why we are so pleased with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a stopwatch and a unit converter - they both feature decent functionality, no bangs and whistles. Truth be told, we are not exactly ecstatic about the set of conversions it has to offer. It has the most commonly used measures and currency conversions but we have seen some handsets do even better.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Accelerometer gaming is on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are three games preinstalled on LG KF750 Secret: GrandGolf, SudokuPuzzle and M-Toy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GrandGolf is a Java interpretation of the popular game. It is comparatively easy to play and if you like such games it just might be worth your time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't much to tell about the SudokuPuzzle game either. There are three difficulty levels, which should be enough for different types of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we come to the M-toy game. It is in fact a set of 6 mini-games, which put the built-in accelerometer to use. We found them entertaining enough and the accelerometer response really precise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The six games that are part of the M-Toy application are Dart, Homerun Derby, Magic Ball, Hammer, Maze, and Fishing. Dart is a darts game where you send your darts flying by swinging the handset itself. The Homerun Derby is a baseball batting game where you play as the batter unleashing your bat again by swinging the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Hammer, where you play a hammer thrower - swinging the handset around builds up power before you finally release the hammer with the D-pad. The Maze game includes navigating a ball around an increasingly complex maze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Fishing game, where you play as the angler controlling your fishing rod - you are responsible of swinging your rod to the right place and then reeling back the fishing line once you have a fish on your hook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the Magic Ball is pretty self explanatory - the Magic 8-Ball is a well-known yes/no fortune telling game but the LG implementation is not that traditional and at times offers some really funny answers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To wrap it up, we are impressed with the LG KF750 Secret. Once again we've got proof that LG are committed to improving a little something in every new high-end handset they release and not just replicate and facelift old designs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are so pleased with the Secret mainly because that it's a lot of fun to use. It has the looks to get your attention and the features to keep it. What is more, on almost every occasion its performance lives up to the promise of the specs sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, it is not all bed of roses for the KF750. It has its imperfections just like any other device on the market. The sunlight legibility issues of the screen and the limited touch control do give market rivals a chance. However we still find the LG Secret capable enough of standing its ground in the highly competitive high-end segment.</paragraph>
