			<paragraph>It's 12 and counting for cameraphones but the real thick of action is at the 8 megapixel notch. There goes the next of them exciting imaging gadgets waiting to be put in play. We've got a bit of catching up with the LG Viewty Smart to do since our first rendezvous. But let's quickly review the basics. Whether you call it an LG Arena with a beefier camera or a Viewty on S-Class, we guess we're happy either way. Oh, you can also call it Viewty2, while we go on and check if it's 2 good 2 miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sweet waistline and slick packaging, the Viewty Smart carries quite an impressive feature set including a 3" capacitive touchscreen, 8 megapixel autofocus camera with loads of options and the high-flying S-Class Touch UI. The Viewty is not smartphone kind of smart but the inspired interface and the sharp gadgety looks do give its name some credence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG GC900 is not just another cameraphone but one worthy of bearing the name of the original Viewty. For a bit of household drama, the Viewty Smart will be rightfully expected to outdo another strong performer like the Renoir. And to make the family tree even more intricate, comparison with the Arena will be inevitable. That said, the Viewty Smart sure has style and quality of its own. The feel and looks, the upgrades and the performance sound like a good enough reason for a proper in-depth review. And mind you, the LG GC900 Viewty Smart is not all about the imaging. With an inviting touchscreen platform, complete connectivity set (Wi-Fi and HSDPA), great music and DivX/XviD videos, the Viewty Smart promises a fun and exciting ride.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 Viewty legacy doesn't come out so obvious on the comparative shots. You will hardly tell that the elegantly edgy Viewty Smart is the direct descendent of the boxy Viewty 1. Well then, we guess we're eager to see it in action and look for the imaging talent we sure hope the parent has passed on. In all fairness, looking back at the original, the weaknesses are well obvious but if the upgrade would match the splash the Viewty made two years ago, it can safely call it a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're all set then for a closer look at the Viewty Smart exterior. Hit the jump for our scoop on design and ergonomics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GC900 Viewty Smart 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The sharp and compact LG GC900 Viewty Smart looks quite attractive with an almost all black front and a silvery faux-brushed-metal rear. Unlike the LG KM900 Arena, the back cover of the GC900 is all plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A version with an all-silver casing is also available and judging solely by the press images it looks as neat as the black one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It turns out the Viewty Smart hasn't changed much since our last encounter with a pre-market sample.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Viewty Smart measures 108.9 x 56.1 x 12.4 mm, which is just about a millimeter bigger than the LG Arena in each direction. The LG GC900 Viewty Smart has a higher-res camera of course, but skips the 3.5mm standard audio jack and FM transmitter. However, a 3.5mm adapter is available in the retail package. The rest of the stuff to find in the box includes a data cable, wall charger, software CD and a user guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GC900 Viewty Smart is a bit smaller than the Apple iPhone 3GS and the slanting top and bottom give it a keener stance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the LG GC900 Viewty Smart is almost all a 3" 16M-color capacitive touchscreen. It uses the TFT technology as opposed to the AMOLED screens on recently reviewed Samsung handsets. We have no issues though with picture quality. The brightness and contrast levels are excellent, comparable to the best examples in the class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can expect of a capacitive touchscreen, the LG GC900 Viewty is marvelously responsive. You'll be amazed by the keen to react cube interface and the fluid scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, sunlight legibility is a huge letdown. In fact the Viewty Smart (just like the Arena and the original Viewty back in the day) is one of the worst performers on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the Viewty Smart front panel is earpiece, video-call camera and the ambient light sensor used for automatically controlling the screen brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The regular receiver keys at the bottom are gone in favor of a long and slim Back key that goes from side to side.It's actually only the central part of the strip that can be pressed. The Back button on this unit is not as stiff as on the pre-release sample we previewed but has a rather flimsy press. Oftentimes we were unsure if we pressed it right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no actual Send and End buttons on the device and you can either use the virtual onscreen keys or the Back button instead. Upon an incoming call, a single press of the Back button mutes the ringer and another one rejects the call. The not so great tactility aside, the Back button is quite handy given the Viewty Smart's flat menu structure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the LG Viewty Smart features the LG proprietary connectivity port hidden under a protective cap. The port is used for plugging a charger, data cable, headphones or a TV-out cable. As we already mentioned, the Viewty Smart lacks the 3.5 mm audio jack of the LG Arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side also hosts the volume rocker and the camera shutter key. For some unknown reason, the shutter key will only launch the camera if you're on the standby screen. Pressing it elsewhere through the menus won't do a thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Viewty Smart are the microSD card slot (supports up to 32GB) and the Cube Interface key, which also launches the task manager upon a press and hold. The Cube is the 3D version of the four homescreens of the S-class user interface. As for the microSD cards, the unit had no problems dealing with our 16GB card carrying tons of files, and the initializing time was more than acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the LG Viewty Smart is perfectly plain, featuring only a mouthpiece, while the top hosts the On/Off key, which quite comfortably now also doubles as a lock key for the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the LG GC900 Viewty Smart hosts the 8 megapixel camera and its Power LED flash. The lens doesn't have any protection at all but is lower than the surrounding surface so it won't get easily scratched when you put the phone on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already pointed out, the back of the Viewty Smart looks quite the part with its brushed metallic finish, though in reality it's all plastic. We do suppose that once the plastic starts wearing off the Viewty Smart's back will lose much of its charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undreneath Viewty Smart's battery cover we find the SIM card compartment and the 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery which is almost identical to the one we came across in the LG Arena. It will last about two days under some pretty extensive usage and to be honest we expected less. The huge number of pixels to refresh and the power consuming features such as GPS and Wi-Fi are known to usually drain similar batteries in a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our overall impressions of the LG GC900 Viewty Smart build quality are on the positive side. In fact, our main concern is the vulnerable camera lens. Everything else seems just about fine. The touchscreen bar is well put together and feels quite solid. The sharp looks are an added gain and the only thing to fear would be the plastic wearing off at some pint. The handling is very comfortable - we guess the Back key works better as a design accent than an actual control but it's not a major issue.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S-Class hasn't changed a bit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S-Class UI has already taken a prominent place among mobile phone interfaces. LG look to have struck gold with it and the new fancy 3D platform will thrive across touchscreen feature phones and Windows Mobile handsets alike.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Class builds heavily upon previous UI solutions in the LG range and thus still feels familiar enough even with the solid amount of upgrades.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive touchscreen is quite responsive and haptic feedback has always been on the LG feature list. Hardware graphic acceleration is essential: everything from homescreen to dropdown menus rolls, sweeps in, unfolds and revolves extra smoothly. The LG Arena gave us a good glimpse of all that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some may be moan the lack of any distinction between the LG Arena and the Viewty Smart in terms of interface - same icons, same menus, etc. Don't get this wrong - the S-Class is in no need of major tweaks, but at least a unique theme for each phone would've been nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's proceed with the rundown of the S-Class UI, which is novel enough to warrant a closer look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing to note is the four homescreens, which break down the interface into four easily manageable chunks: widgets, contacts, shortcuts and multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eye catching 3D Cube is the core of the interface - the four homescreens are placed on the sides of a cube that you roll by finger sweeps. You can zoom out by pressing the dedicated key and roll the cube to select a homescreen. The 3D Cube interface is nothing unique: it dates back to the HTC cube launcher and gets various interpretations like in the Samsung Jet we just recently covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Shortcut homescreen is well known since the LG Cookie and LG Prada2. The empty space can be populated with various shortcuts for different apps. But given the wonderful main menu, we are not sure this screen is all that necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Widget homescreen offers a bunch of widgets we've seen before in previous LG or Samsung handsets - there's the analog clock, calendar, world time, WeatherBug, games, FM radio, memo, and a calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging widget you see on the top of the widget screen is a new addition. It gives you quick access to the voice, text or email features, as well as a log of new events in any of the above categories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third Cube wall contains the Contact homescreen, where you can assign photos to various contacts for quick access to their numbers and SMS/call options. They are displayed on a rotating reel, similar to how the fourth multimedia homescreen is filled with pictures and songs. All the reels are touch-optimized and on some occasions are very quick and efficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of all though, these 3D simulations throughout the interface are just there for the sake of good looks before any practical purpose. We find the Contact homescreen the most appropriate for a homescreen and in fact many users prefer it, while the Multimedia and Shortcuts leave the impression of mostly filling the Cube space with content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter which homescreen you choose, the UI never skimps on eye candy - smooth animations, reflections, 3D spatial effects, motion blurring - it's all there for your viewing pleasure. And better still - the 3" WVGA screen makes sure the image quality is exceptional.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S-Class main menu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty Smart main menu is accessible via the dedicated shortcut on the home screen. LG have opted for a layout of four rows of menu items that are scrollable horizontally. This way almost all menu items are accessible simultaneously without jumping tabs, like it used to be on previous LG touch handsets. Turning the phone sideways, the auto-rotate kicks in listing all menu items with smaller icons fitting the screen perfectly with no need for scrolling (but with no text labels either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Viewty Smart has the basic task manager, which is launched upon a press-and-hold of the Cube key on the handset's left side. This is another way to access the most common features, not just switch between the active ones. The active apps are signified by the respective icon bouncing up and down in a nice animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking is limited - only two applications can run at a time and Java apps interfere with other apps. For example, with a Java app running in the background you won't be able to turn the Radio on. Tapping the Status bar at the top of the screen launches a semitransparent menu that can be used to toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and off, change profiles and view recent events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this connection manager menu is available only on the homescreen. It would have been handier if it was usable throughout the interface - the way it is in the Android OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook omits kinetic scrolling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Viewty Smart, just like the LG Arena sports one of the most attractive and best touch-optimized phonebooks we've seen so far on a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Contact list has tiny separators with the corresponding alphabetical letter. If not expanded, every field has a picture icon, a name and a green call button for quick dial. To display the full contact details you simply tap on it and its contents expand in a dropdown right between the neighboring phonebook names. There you can also find the different buttons for calls, messages and editing organized in a scrollable row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most of the interface on the GC900 Viewty Smart, the phonebook is highly touch-optimized too. Scrolling is as smooth as possible with no lags and this is the only UI currently on the market to match the fluid response of the iPhone. There is a scroll bar on the right side to allow movement through the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course there is a search option and it's available at the top of your contact list. The other way to access it is by the dedicated options button in the upper left corner. In the same two locations you'll also find the "New contact" buttons. The available fields are pretty standard and offer whatever you can think up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally you can put a shortcut on the photo contact homescreen by selecting the small star button next to a contact. This contact then automatically appears in the appropriate place and you can reorder via tap-and-hold on the contact homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll hear us compare (and quite favorably too) the S-Class UI with the iPhone but here comes a feature the Viewty Smart (and the Arena for that matter) is short of. Kinetic scrolling would've made the great phonebook just perfect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty Smart handles phone calls flawlessly, as you have every right to expect. The phone dialer works with an on-screen numeric keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any LG handset - the green receiver key (only virtual on the Viewty Smart, though) takes you to the list of all calls. You can access them from the main menu too, but unlike the previous LG handsets, you won't find call time counters and the web data counter here. Instead, those are moved to the Call settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dial is also onboard. As usual, you can type any numbers and you'll receive suggestions immediately. They'll be organized in a dropdown window, same as a contact's details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Call history is accessed by the virtual green button at the bottom of the dialer screen and it also takes after the phonebook with its dropdown layout. The readings you get there are the usual call duration, time and type of call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GC900 Viewty Smart scored pretty well in our loudspeaker performance test. Here is it stacks up against some of the other handsets we've put through it. More info on our test is available here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Cool messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are only two major sections in the main menu - Messaging and Email. The LG Viewty Smart supports sending and receiving SMS, MMS, and email messages. Much like the Arena, Renoir and Viewty, SMS and MMS share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messages are neatly organized in a standard list view and sorted by date. You can choose a filter - SMS, MMS or notifications. Naturally, the Inbox is the default location when you enter the Messaging menu, but you can change it to Outbox, Sent, Drafts or My Folders. There is also an option for a threaded view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For typing you can use either the number pad, or you can flip the Viewty Smart on its side and go for the landscape QWERTY keyboard. There is touch feedback either way, and typing is very accurate even if the QWERTY keyboard buttons are a bit small. Either way, thanks to the capacitive screen both produce no lag and are as responsive as the iPhone's virtual QWERTY.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to emails, set up on the LG Viewty Smart is hassle-free. Adding an email account is a breeze thanks to the clever setup scheme. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you need to enter. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported and you can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. The email client supports SSL encryption too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maximum attachment size for both outgoing and incoming mail is 1MB, as it was on the LG Arena. This is not enough for a 8 megapixel photo, a shame really. A 3.2 MP snap or a small video will go through, while attachments such as documents or presentations should not be a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Renoir for example had a 2MB limit, which is still restricting, but a bit more adequate. If you decide to attach a picture in the Viewty Smart's email client it won't even resize automatically. The only way for the phone to do it for you is choosing the "Attach - Take a picture" button in the email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, archive files such as ZIP or RAR are not among the supported file types for attachments, but still you can save those to the phone memory when you receive them. MS Office and PDF files can be opened and viewed directly inside the email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've downloaded your messages, you can use the search feature to find specific emails or you can sort them by various filters such as date, sender, priority, read/unread, subject, size, etc. There is also an option for setting multiple emails as "Read".</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>File management is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty Smart comes with 1.5GB of onboard storage and of course it's expandable via the microSD memory card slot. Hot-swapping a memory card is easy, especially given that this time the slot is not under the battery cover. We can also confirm that 8GB and 16GB microSD cards worked fine on our unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GC900 Viewty Smart file manager appears as the My Stuff item in the menu. It includes separate factory-preset folders, but you may put various content in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File browsing is generally fast, even when your memory card has loads of images on (800+ in our case). The files on the phone memory and the card can't be browsed together as you could on some previous LG handsets. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, because it eliminates the problem of always seeing the files from the microSD before all others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery gets straight "A"s<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Viewty Smart offers two gallery modes depending on the handset's orientation, the same as in the Arena. In portrait mode images and videos are displayed in a grid sorted by date, type or name, while in landscape mode one image is displayed in the center with two more on its sides in a nice 3D spatial view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Did anybody say Cover Flow? Yes, the layout is quite similar to the Apple iPhone Cover Flow album art browsing, but let us remind you that the iPhone only offers that view mode in its iPod app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the LG GC900 Viewty Smart, following the LG Arena, supports multi-touch you can zoom in on images with the pinching gesture on the iPhone. Bear in mind that 8 megapixel photos zoom slower than 2 or 3 megapixel snaps taken with an iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the standard options such as rename, delete, print, send and info, there is also a slideshow mode. You can choose the time interval and the display order (shuffle or not). The nice transition effects are random, we couldn't find a dedicated option for choosing a specific one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the "star" button is also here for creating picture shortcuts on the multimedia homescreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dolby Mobile reports for duty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty Smart music player is accessible both from the Cube interface and the main menu. The Cube-accessed music player is rather basic but it does offer a quick way in to your tunes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The individual music tracks are displayed on a rotating reel and come with their album art "printed" on virtual vinyl records. You can scroll with your finger through them to change tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full-featured music player sits in the main menu. You can sort tracks by artist, album, genre and rating. The current track's artwork, name, album and artist are displayed in the screen's center while the next and previous tracks are visible at the top and bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new addition here is the huge Shuffle button on the top of the playlist, which is quite comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, the music player automatically switches its orientation from/to landscape mode when you rotate the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A very useful feature is the Search option. However, if you have applied some kind of sorting such as album view, for instance, you can only search the album names and not the actual tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are tons of equalizer presets (all non-customizable, though) and among them two managed to impress us. The first is the highly promoted Dolby for Mobile sound enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Dolby Mobile the sound is richer and more spacious. Bobcat Mobile was also a really nice preset which is best suited for techno tracks. With all the presets available we're sure you'll find the one to suit your needs.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Viewty Smart comes with an FM radio that you can liste to both via the headphones and the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the headphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio stores up to 50 stations and there is support for receiving two-line radio station info over RDS. Scrolling stations is very easy and intuitive - you have quick access via the two rows of buttons below the main window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the music player, when the FM radio is running in the background you can control it using the home screen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally a Bluetooth headset is also supported, allowing you to listen to music via stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GC900 Viewty smart demonstarted excellent audio output, getting commendable scores on most of the readings in our traditional audio quality test. The handset even manages to slightly outdo the Apple iPhone 3GS on some criterias and that's about as good as they get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only notable problem with the Viewty Smart audio quality are its cut-off bass frequencies, probably due to some kind of high-pass filter meant to improve sound on small size headphones. We had exactly the same issue with the KM900 Arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the LG GC900 Viewty Smart has decent intermodulation distortion and oustanding dynamic range, noise level and stereo crosstalk readings. The total harmonic distortion extremely low value is also commendable achievement. And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player does its job? most of the time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty Smart comes with a high-res WVGA and relatively large touch screen at 3". That, along with the DivX/XviD support turns it into a potentially excellent portable video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the only DivX videos we managed to play on the Viewty Smart were those processed by the DivX converter on the supplied CD. The LG Renoir for example managed to play every desktop XViD/DivX video we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch the video player to full screen mode you only need to rotate the phone to landscape position. A tap on the touch screen reveals the onscreen overlay controls. Alongside the standard controls (such as play/pause, volume, etc.) you can also change playing speed to 2x or 4x and to zoom in or out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dolby for Mobile sound enhancement can also be applied during video playback on the LG Viewty Smart. Of course, that enhancement is put to best use with headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Really, is it so hard to add Wi-Fi streaming?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Viewty Smart comes with YouTube integration and you can upload videos to YouTube directly from the handset. Bear in mind that the option is available only in the video player and not in the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the LG Viewty Smart web browser, as every other LG phone, doesn't have Flash support, so watching YouTube videos on the desktop version of the web site is a no-go. The only way to watch your favorite videos is via the mobile version of YouTube.com.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately and typically, the LG Viewty Smart allows you to watch streaming media (of any type) only over the EDGE or UMTS connection, so in essence - you cannot watch the streaming mobile YouTube videos over Wi-Fi. A real bummer, we know. The same strange issue plagues the Arena, the Prada 2 and the Renoir. Is it really impossible for LG to add that feature?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And since a lot of users don't seem aware of this fact, here's a tip - to watch streaming videos (such as YouTube) you first need to set up the dedicated streaming settings of the phone to use the same internet profile as your mobile web browser. The place you do that is on Settings row&gt;Connectivity&gt; Streaming settings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing 8 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GC900 Viewty Smart sports an 8 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. It boasts fancy Schneider-Kreuznach optics and a LED flash which, as you might have guessed, doesn't do much good. It might only make a difference in extremely dark conditions at the closest of ranges but don't expect anything beyond that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface of the GC900 Viewty Smart is identical to the one on the KM900 Arena. Access to all the camera settings is via the left taskbar in the viewfinder. There you get virtual buttons for flash, focus mode (auto/macro) and exposure plus an advanced settings key. This left toolbar auto hides when not used and you need to tap on the screen to bring it back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right hand-side of the screen is another bar with a virtual shutter key, that also slides up and down to switch between still camera and camcorder. Alongside are the exit and gallery buttons. This taskbar is fixed and actually not part of the viewfinder - that's the way to get around the difference between the wide aspect ratio of the screen and the standard 4:3 image sensor. If you don't like that you can opt for the full screen view, where a part of the image does get cropped but you see the center bit in more detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual Settings menu is a clever rotating dial with the available options for each setting displayed as a list. We have to admit that it is somewhat slow to navigate and find the right option but it is certainly very nice looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GC900 Viewty Smart sports a ton of extra camera features with geotagging, face recognition and smile shot being some of the most notable. You also get image stabilization and viewfinder grid to help you better frame your photos. The LG GC900 also supports up to ISO 1600 but unless you like looking at 8 megapixels of noisy noise, we would suggest you stay as far away from it as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the LG GC900 Viewty Smart was somewhat of a disappointment. It might do the job if you aren't too fussy but any comparison to other 8 megapixel handsets on the market is to the Viewty's detriment. It's a pity, considering that the good old LG KU900 Viewty was up with them great 5 megapixel shooters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we have to say anything positive about the image quality it'd be that the colors are pretty decent and so is contrast in the photos. The amount of resolved detail is also good but the noise levels can basically ruin the whole deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GC900 Viewty Smart is by far the noisiest 8 megapixel camera we have seen so far and the difference is easily visible even at the lowest ISO settings. This is probably THE handset to confirm the "more MP equals more noise" mantra. While we'd still pick it over most 5 MP shooters, the Viewty Smart won't be our weapon of choice in the 8 MP game.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can easily see how vastly superior the Samsung i8510 INNOV8 is in terms of resolved detail just by looking at the two charts above.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GC900 Viewty Smart is capable of capturing video of up to D1 (720x480) resolution at 30 fps. The video recording quality, unlike that of the still camera, is pretty good. The level of detail could have been a touch better, but the colors are lively with an extra notch of saturation added by the camera. The noise isn't at all that much of an issue here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Viewty, just like the Arena, uses the outdated low-bitrate 3GP video format, which we didn't really like. We would much rather see more handsets like the LG Renoir, using AVI file format with DivX encoding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Slow-motion QVGA clips shot at 120 fps are also an option on the LG Viewty Smart and the device much like the LG Secret and Arena, takes the extra step of adding Fast videos. This is the time-lapse video capture seen in some dedicated digicams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the right subjects those shoot modes can be quite fun. Unfortunately, the output videos are still limited to QVGA resolution. The Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH for example already shoots fast motion videos at VGA resolution of enviable quality. And as we see it, those videos don't require more processing power than there already is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flash can be turned on to act as a video light. Quite naturally, you can also record sound with videos, except in the fast/slow-mo modes of course. As we already pointed out, the dedicated video recording microphone is on the back of the phone. Videos are encoded in MP4 but are saved in 3GP format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a sample D1 video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wireless connectivity is complete on the LG Viewty Smart. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE is on board and so is the HSDPA 7.2 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also supports the two local connectivity standards - Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The Bluetooth version is 2.1 with A2DP support for stereo streaming while the Wi-Fi antenna works with 802.11 b/g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi options have a simple interface - you choose the desired network, type the pass key and voila. Of course there are plenty of advanced options available for the geeks out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last and most important thing is that every installed Java application which requires internet access prompts you to choose between UMTS and Wi-Fi, which is a great option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary universal connectivity port is used to connect the charger or a USB cable. Speaking of USB, Mass storage mode is also supported so you can use the phone as portable memory storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to LG Arena, the Viewty Smart's internal memory gets listed as a second removable drive along with the memory card contents. We were also impressed that the Viewty Smart can even receive calls in this mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing PIM details is done through the LG PC Suite that comes on the bundled CD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An optional TV-out cable can also be plugged into the connectivity port as the Viewty Smart supports the feature. PAL and NTSC are supported, so it should work on most TV sets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Slow browser with no Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The decent browser is identical to the LG Arena's. Unfortunately, scrolling and panning is not really that fluid. Thanks to the multi-touch implementation, the Viewty Smart delivers where other browsers fail - the legendary 'pinch' zoom of the iPhone (well, the Hero and Pre are going to have it too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loading speeds are not enviable either. Over Wi-Fi, the LG Viewty Smart browser takes twice the time to fully load a page than the iPhone's and you can't really pan around while the page is still loading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-touch zooming has been tweaked since the latest LG Prada phone, but not at all compared to the LG Arena. There still is a slight lag, though nothing major. It's not as fluid as the iPhone but still does an ok job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls don't auto-hide and the only option to make them disappear is to turn on the full screen view from the browser menu or rotate the phone to landscape. There the accelerometer comes into play and does its job pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A useful feature is that you can have two pages open at the same time in tabs and switch back and forth between them. Saving pages for offline viewing is another thing that you'll probably use quite often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another handy browser skill is searching web pages for specific words - the first match gets highlighted and the total number of matches is displayed with up and down buttons to scroll them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A visual enhancement of the plain browsing history list is the option to view snapshots of the pages you've visited. You can flick between the pages and tap to open the one you are looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, desktop YouTube watching is a no-go, as the browser lacks full Flash support. But, as we already pointed out in the video section of this review, you can go for the mobile version of YouTube found at m.youtube.com once you setup your streaming settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried the Opera Mini browser and it just flies. It's very fast loading pages, zooming or scrolling them, there is also a nice integrated RSS reader. We managed to find a version without the Java touch-dedicated controls and it worked fine. There is no multi-touch in this one, but if you a want speed, then Opera Mini is the way to go for now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What's up today<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keeping a schedule is an important part of the LG Viewty Smart and it has several applications to help you. The nice Organizer combines a calendar with monthly and weekly views and a task list. Event alarms can be set to go off up to a week earlier to give you enough time to prepare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The option to choose whether the week starts Monday or Sunday is also included. There's even an option to mark some days as holidays and set the Alarm not to ring on those days. 'Holidays' are not repeated annually so it's more useful to mark your vacation rather than national holidays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A To-Do application lets you keep a list of tasks sorted by their importance. If those reminders aren't enough you can always jot down a Memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GC900 Viewty Smart can store up to 500 calendar events, 500 To-Do notes and 100 memos and making a back up to external memory is just a few clicks away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option in the Organizer menu is the Date Finder. A visually-impressive feature is selecting a month through the main calendar view. It opens a nice spinning wheel with two parts where you can choose the appropriate month and year by rotating the wheels. That can't help but ring our iPhone-copycat bell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm functions have been completely revised for the better. Forget the ugly old settings used on the previous LG flagship phones. Apart from the default widget alarm you can create as many alarms as you want. This gives you access to another eye-catching interface - an analog clock where you set the hand at the desired time. Of course there is a digital one for those who'd rather. The other available settings are alarm tone, vibration type and availability, while the snooze option makes sure you are not late for work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you also get a Calculator with the new touch-optimized interface and a wide array of functions (basic and advanced mathematical functions), a Unit Converter, a World Clock and a Voice recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder does not have a limit on the maximum length of a voice note and once you are done recording you can send it via MMS, email or Bluetooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS enabled, this time for real<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Viewty Smart has a couple of shortcomings, which put off a lot of people. First of all, it comes with an older version of Google Maps, that can't use My Location service. Second, and most important, the new Google Maps and most of the Java software turned fully incompatible with the Arena's GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the most popular electronic map software for mobile phones. It comes preinstalled on the LG Viewty Smart too and makes use of its built-in GPS receiver. Still the Java-powered version of the app wasn't meant for this screen resolution (480x800) and looks awkward on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had some problems picking a signal lock with our pre-release unit, just like with the Arena, but in the final Viewty Smart all is fixed and working just fine. In about 30 seconds Google Maps got our approximate location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the fact that the LG Viewty Smart lacks smartphone capabilities will be quite limiting when it comes to picking GPS voice-guided navigation software (or any third-party software for that matter) and the choice will be quite limited (if there are any options available at all).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games &amp; Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled Picsel viewer handles Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files. Zooming in and out is done by - you guessed it - pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a useful option to fit the contents in a single column but it only seems to work for doc files. The viewer makes full use of the accelerometer and auto rotates to take advantage of the wide screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled games on the LG Viewty Smart are all motion-based - Flying Dice, Wheel Mania, Tepong, Dart, Fishing, Homerun derby and the two microphone controlled - Bubble Breeze and Mellow Candle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flying dice lets you pick a board and play against another player. You take turns to roll two dice (by shaking the phone of course) and then release them on the table. You move round the board and can either land on a good or a bad square. Landing on a bad square means you get beaten on the head.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wheel Mania also lets you choose a template - cards, foods, drinks, activities, cars and more. Then you spin the wheel and wait to see your fortune.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third game is ping-pong and we spent most of the time on it. It's simple enough - you must hit a ping-pong ball with increasing power and score more and more? until you hit an airplane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dart, Fishing and Homerun Derby are very simple and altogether pointless games just for showing off the accelerometer gimmicks. In all three you make a specific movement with a flick of the hand - hit the target with a bolt, angle the fishing rod or hit the ball with the club. Three attempts to score some points and game over. Simple, easy and pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final two games - Bubble Breeze and Mellow Candle - are about blowing in the Viewty Smart's microphone to produce bubbles on the screen or just blow out the candle's flame. Again - simple and nutty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If those aren't enough (and they really aren't if you are into mobile gaming), you can install Java MIDP 2.0 games and applications.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Viewty Smart is the LG KM900 Arena in cameraphone disguise. That alone is enticing enough by our books. The Viewty Smart has a bit of everything - touch technology and S-Class UI, 8 megapixel camera, above average media and entertainment package. From a pure upgrader's point of view the Viewty Smart is an out-and-out improvement over the original Viewty. But it's this very same family affair that puts the Viewty2 in quite a predicament.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KM900 Arena</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It might look like a very smart (and certainly cost-efficient) move by LG to develop two handsets at the price of one but somehow the comparison between the Viewty Smart and the Arena is not in the favor of the cameraphone. At least not at this point, when the price difference is so significant. We guess, many people will be asking themselves if a couple of more megapixels are worth the cash and the missing FM transmitter, less onboard storage and loosing 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then, there's also pressure from the outside with a bunch of good performers trying to outsmart the Viewty Smart. Samsung S8000 Jet has just hit the shelves but is already winning many customers. The new 3D TouchWiz interface may as well be a match for the S-Class, especially on such a powerful hardware package as the Jet. The compact design and equally matched feature set (including full DivX/XviD support, full Flash support, Smart Unlock, excellent 5MP camera) make the Jet quite a threat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8000 Jet</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end - it's hard not to like the LG Viewty Smart. But comparisons to the Arena and the daunting Viewty legacy are probably too hard for it to handle. We stand by our words that the Viewty2 is a complete and worthy upgrade, but we somehow doubt it we'll see the same sort of impact. It feels like the Viewty Smart will only reach cruising speed after a due reduction of price, which is likely to happen earlier than for the LG Arena.</paragraph>
