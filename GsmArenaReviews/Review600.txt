			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei has long had a spot on the smartphone map, devices like the P8 and Mate 7 trying really hard to break new ground in the premium segment. Refined exterior and competitive specs but not quite competitive price points, Huawei wants to be a brand driven by quality, not discounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 has the flagship looks and build quality but the matching price tag would've been easier to live with was it not for the essentially midrange performance. But as far as build and finish go, the P8 makes no compromise. It leaves that to the P8lite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the name suggests, it's an attempt at an affordable but equally stylish alternative of the flagship, from which it does take a lot of design cues. Of course, to nearly cut the price in half Huawei had to swap metal for plastic and most of the hardware has been toned down more than just a notch as well. Still, the look and feel is there - and for a fraction of the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can surely guess, like most other Huawei handsets, the P8lite is powered one of the company's custom chipsets - the HiSilicon Kirin 620. There is also a Snapdragon 615-based variant of the same device, bound to the US, but most units you're likely to come across have the Kirin chip. This custom architecture is a bit of a gamble but, at least, in this price bracket it will compete against the likes of Qualcomm's S615 and even 410.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We got our hands on both versions so we'll be able to give you a comparative look on how they fare in the performance and battery life departments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei might have skipped on some premium finish on the P8lite, but the build quality is still impressive. The phone looks quite sturdy, everything is tightly assembled and fits nicely. The frame even does a pretty good job at emulating a brushed-metal finish and can definitely be confused for the real thing, even up close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom chipset, however is slightly off-putting. Kirin chips have frequently failed to deliver high-end performance in the past so that's one thing we'll certainly watch closely. And the 64-bit Kirin 620 is significantly underpowered compared to the Kirin 930 inside the P8, so we don't really expect much from the eight Coretex-A53 cores, running at only 1.2 GHz. The Mali-450MP4 GPU has also consistently failed to impress. We certainly have higher expectations of the US-only Snapdragon 615-based version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not rush to judgment though. Follow along to see the Huawei P8lite from every angle before we proceed to benchmarking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Huawei P8lite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like its bigger sibling, the Huawei P8lite arrives in style. The retail box is impressive, all-white and very tastefully made with a coat of textured finish that instantly makes a premium impression. The insides are also quite intriguing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The box contents are neatly arranged inside two separate compartments, one for booklets and one for all the accessories. They are not plastic-coated like in the Huawei P8's packaging, most likely to keep the cost down, yet the presentation is still just as impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the phone itself, the package contains a 1A A/C Adapter, a USB cable and a set of Huawei earphones, reminiscent of Apple's current design.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei P8lite 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite the lack of metal, the Huawei P8lite is still a gorgeous device all around and definitely carries the characteristic design of the P8.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looking at the Huawei P8lite, we can't avoid the parallels to the Huawei P8 and that's obviously the desired effect for any lite version of a handset. We were happy to see that the phone is just as stylish as its bigger sibling and, judging by the excellent build, we can safely say that the differences in materials and finish are in no way detrimental to the overall look and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The styling is simple and has a universal appeal. Like we already mentioned, there is no metal on the P8lite. It has been swapped for plastic, which may be mainstream but by no means cheap. The back feels really sturdy, perhaps even more so than the metal on the P8. There's a subtle texture to the rear finish, which feels good and looks quite impressive. The sides are all plastic as well, but there is still a frame masterfully crafted to look like brushed metal and the effect is quite convincing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8lite is both smaller and lighter than the P8. It is 143mm tall and 70.6mm wide. It isn't as thin as its metal sibling but 7.7mm is actually a slim enough profile. Naturally, it is also lighter, weighing in at 131grams. The P8lite has slightly bigger bezels and a screen to body ratio of 68.2%, compared to the 71.4% of the P8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also worth mentioning that just like the P8, the P8lite has kept to a flush back design with nothing protruding and no camera bump. Granted, that is a lot less impressive when the 13MP camera doesn't have OIS, but it is the general principle that counts and having your phone sit flush on a flat surface is becoming a rare occurrence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has decided to stick with the glass insert in the top portion of the rear panel - not a reception issue here obviously but simply an attempt to keep a consistent look and feel. It is a small touch but indicative of the attention to detail the manufacturer has put into the P8lite. The glass is even coated with Gorilla Glass 3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The controls on the Huawei P8lite are almost identical to those on the P8, which in turn take after the Huawei Ascend P7. Buttons are laid out conveniently and everything is within easy reach. The buttons are also quire responsive, so we are definitely glad that Huawei hasn't been changing things too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8lite has retained the signature minimalistic design of its sibling. Nothing is really out of place or out of measure. Huawei has opted for a 5.0-inch IPS LCD panel, which may not be as impressive as the Full HD IPS screen of the P8, but more than reasonable for the class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the main controls on the actual screen, the only thing underneath is a company logo. They could've easily done without, like on the P8, which simply makes for a cleaner design. However, we should note that the lack of a logo on the P8 is perhaps dictated by a concept called film navigation that allows the user to add capacitive buttons via a special screen protector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not an option on the P8lite, which is worth noting if you happen to be familiar with the clever navigation trick on the P8 and expect the lite version to offer it as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is not much else in plain sight on the front of the device. There is the earpiece and the 8MP front-facing camera, tightly packed next to it. There are also proximity and light sensors beside the earpiece, but they are very well concealed. There is also a very small status LED near the top left corner, but it is absolutely invisible when off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going around the device, we find the left side bare, just as it is on the P8. Even the small plastic inserts are gone, as they are no longer needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side is where it gets busy. It houses a total of four controls and yet doesn't really feel cluttered. The volume rocker is on top, with a nice oval shape and precision cut design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right below it is the power switch, which still resides in its own groove, just like on the P8. This really helps in guiding your thumb to the right place. These controls are really an almost exact replica of those on the P8, just made from plastic rather than metal. Still, the design and feel is absolutely identical, even the circular pattern of the power button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the button, we find two separate card slots, both sitting flush with the frame. One houses the primary microSIM card, while the second tray accepts either a microSD card or a secondary nanoSIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm headphone jack is placed at the top of the device. Next to it is the secondary noise-canceling microphone. These are perhaps the only controls that have been slightly rearranged compared to the P8, but it is nothing really significant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Huawei P8lite has two symmetrical grilles, but only one of them houses a speaker. The main microphone is hidden under the other. The P8 does also have a set of screws for the main body assembly, which are missing here, so perhaps the back plate has to be pried open to disassemble the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side is perfectly flat, without a protruding camera lens. Like the rest of the exterior, the back of the P8lite is quite similar to the P8. The metal finish might be gone but, as far as plastic goes, we really can't find any fault with the kind Huawei used on the P8lite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera sits in the top left corner, but slightly further away from the edge, which might help prevent incidental covering, a problem on the P8. The dual tone LED flash has been swapped for a simpler single LED, placed on the other side of the lens.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite is equipped with a pretty standard IPS LCD panel. It is definitely a step down from the the P8 in both size, 5.0" instead of 5.2, and resolution, 720p vs. 1080p. Still, it does look pretty sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>294ppi is also far from ideal but perfectly adequate, considering the asking price. When compared to the P8 however, there is an easily noticeable difference in quality. Huawei might have managed to keep the P8 look and feel intact in the lite version, but the IPS-NEO screen isn't there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result, we can't really expect near AMOLED blacks and contrast, which the original P8 delivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8lite is quite dim with only 362 nits at full blast. This is nowhere near the 584 of the P8 and quite surprisingly, also far from what the older Ascend P7 is capable of. The fact is that you can easily pick up a much brighter device in the same price range. Contrast is also quite poor, again almost half that of its premium sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility of the device is fairly good. Definitely not spectacular, but you won't have any problems using the phone outdoors if you avoid direct sunlight.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei P8lite battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite is powered by a 2200mAh battery. It is non-removable and of slightly smaller capacity than the one inside the P8, which however has a more power-hungry screen and chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei seems to have shaved a number of software features off the P8lite and that includes some of the more-advanced power saving options its bigger sibling has. This might be part of the reason why it did rather poorly in our battery life tests, scoring a total endurance rating of only 53 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put things in perspective, the original Huawei P8 scored 64 hours under the very same conditions. This comparison is important, but also flawed, as the two phones do use quite different chipsets and the P8 does have the advantage of an extra 480mAh of juice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, a browser score of only 8:27 hours is disappointing. Granted, things are a lot better when using Chrome instead of the bundled browser but video playback, which was rated at 9 hours is also low and we find it hard to blame the built in video app in this case. Still, you can definitely count on the P8lite lasting through a full day on a single charge. Make sure you use the browser and the media player sparingly if you want to squeeze more time out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison, the Snapdragon-based version of the P8lite managed to do noticeably better in our battery tests. The main improvement over the Kirin version seems to be in the Stand-by and Call segments. With a total endurance rating of 61 hours, the Snapdragon 615-based P8lite is a lot closer to the premium P8 and definitely offers an improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no support for Quick Charging or wireless charging on either models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As previously mentioned, the Huawei P8lite is a dual SIM device. It also offers dual standby. It comes in two main flavors - we're testing the Kirin 620-powered version but there's a Snapdragon 615-powered variant, intended for the US. Naturally, they support different network bands but both come with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE and 3G with HSDPA. The Kirin variant has tri-band 3G and quad-band 4G, whereas the Snapdragon ALE-L04 model offers quad-band 3G and a penta-band 4G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both can reach speeds of up to 42.2Mbps of download and 5.76Mbps of upload on HSPDA, as well as 150Mbps of downloads over Cat.4 LTE. This is available on both SIM cards, but one of them does share a slot with the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n. Unfortunately, Wi-Fi 802.11ac is not supported. Bluetooth 4.0 is also on board with A2DP, EDR, and LE mode. The microUSB 2.0 port does not support USB host.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The satellite navigation chip inside the phone is compatible with GPS/GLONASS. There's an FM radio on board too. NFC with contactless payments is supported as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8 does also include a few advanced connection options, like Wi-Fi+, Signal+ and Roaming+, which are missing on the P8lite. We understand that the Signal+ cell switching feature requires special hardware, but the Wi-Fi and network connection enhancements in roaming could have perhaps been left in the lite model.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Emotion UI v3.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The international Huawei P8lite boots the company's own EMUI. It's the latest EMUI 3.1, which is the first iteration to be based on Android 5.0 Lollipop, instead of KitKat. The US model however comes with only Android 4.4.4, which is a big question mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already got acquainted with the EMUI 3.1 on Lollipop in the P8 review and since the US P8lite will probably get updated to the same version down the line, we will be basing the following software section on the more recent Lollipop build found on the Kirin-based P8lite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything seems to be identical to the UI on the P8, save for a few advanced features that have been removed. EMUI 3.1 is based on Google's latest platform and yet, it is the similarities with previous Emotion UI versions that seem to stick out, rather than the differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei may have adopted the new core for the sake of all the performance, stability and new API improvements it brings about, but, it is still heavily customized and, on the surface, the OS has retained its signature look and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What Huawei has done, in a nutshell, is adopt Android Lollipop, without Google's new material design. The user interface has remained flat with almost no traces of Google's latest aesthetics. EMUI 3.1 remains true to its style and has preserved the user experience mostly intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fans will also be happy to know that the OS is still packed full of various extras and additional functions, baked right in. Although, frankly, not as many as the P8 and sometimes weirdly differing in minute details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default lockscreen features a nifty "sunshine" effect as you drag your finger across. Huawei's signature feature is the option for changing the lockscreen wallpaper automatically with beautiful images on various topics. You can also have widgets on the lockscreen, iOS-style shortcuts, and even dual clocks when roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics themselves are referred to as Covers and the phone comes with a serious collection of those as well as an app to download even more. They are really being treated like first class citizen with a dedicated download center, complete with channels, subscriptions and auto-updates. You can actually go in, set a few of your preferences and let the covers cycle between every screen wake, so you always have something fresh to look at. That's probably our favorite feature in EMUI as the images make for a stunning and ever-changing lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping from the bottom of the lockscreen reveals a very iOS-like quick shortcut menu. It holds a few options for controlling the covers and cycling through them, as well as shortcuts to a recorder, calculator, flashlight and the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen we find a fairly standard Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts, which are docked at the bottom and are visible on all homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are nine homescreen panes at most - and at least a couple of them will be populated by the preinstalled apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is customary for Chinese Android UIs, there is no app drawer like there would be on vanilla Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anything you install pops up on the homescreen, just as it would on an iPhone or a Xiaomi. While this means that you don't have to bother creating shortcuts to your apps on the homescreens, it also means that you cannot effectively hide any of your installed apps either. You can, however, group them into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch on the homescreen triggers the familiar Overview mode to let you check out and organize the homescreen panes currently in use, remove or add panes as you please. Widgets are available too - it's mostly the stock Android ones, but Huawei has thrown in some of its own as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are available as well. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system and app icons, system font, system color and the sound profile. You can also adjust things like homescreen transition effects, and even change your wallpapers at random or specific time intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The theming engine is so powerful that it can basically transform the UI into and offer incredibly varied experiences. On the surface, it seems to be directly borrowed from the Huawei P8, but unlike its bigger sibling, the P8lite doesn't have access to an online database or ready-made themes. This is slightly odd and the only reason we could think of for shaving this nice feature is the different screen resolution. Still, the rest of the theming engine is intact and if you don't fancy any particular part of a theme or wish to create one from scratch, every single aspect is customizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two pages - one that hold all notifications sorted in a timeline, and another for all of your quick toggles. You can swap around the ones you want visible on the first three rows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shade has undergone some degree of modification in MIUI 3.1. It is now transparent and creates a blur effect underneath, quite reminiscent of iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite features a task switcher that lets you swipe away unwanted apps, and there's a "Clear all" button that also informs you how much memory you've freed up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the P8lite isn't just big on eye-candy. Huawei has invested quite a lot of effort in various usability and accessibility features and most things that are not customizable through theming can still be rearranged and moved around. The phone comes with features, such as customizable navigation bar, simple homescreen, Do not disturb mode, and even one-hand optimizations for system apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, this is also carried over from the bigger P8 model and while a lot has been kept intact, there are a few advanced features missing in the lite version. All of the advanced connectivity options like Wi-Fi+ and Signal+ are absent. While the latter requires additional hardware to receive radio signals from all directions, Huawei could have left Wi-Fi+ on, as its purpose is to simply switch between mobile data and Wi-Fi to ensure the best possible connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode is self-explanatory - you can schedule it when to turn on and off, and you can add a list of exceptions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Various display options are also accessible on a system-wide level. The UI can be tailored to your needs and the lockscreen can be as secure as you would like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>EMUI 3.1 offers granular control over app permissions and their access to various system functions, such as network data and notification areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8lite features a notification center, from which you can control which apps can send you the three types of available notifications - the shade notifications, the lockscreen notifications and the banner style notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This level of control is also employed when it comes to the app access to network data. The user can control the rights of each application to access either WiFi or mobile data. This can save a lot of traffic and help you optimize your data plan and consumption in an easy and convenient way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has given battery management an equally thorough treatment. EMUI has a dedicated interface for managing what it refers to as protected apps. The notion is that only applications that are deemed necessary by the user can be left to run in the background and consume battery and possibly network data, when the screen is off. Any app not on the list has no such privileges. This level of control is astounding and we really wish that other manufacturers would adopt similar mechanisms to give back users granular control of their hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom navigation bar with the default Android controls is customizable - you can swap the task-switcher and back keys, or even add a shortcut for the notification area. You can hide the navigation bar and bring it back with an upwards swipe from the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a one-handed UI mode, for easier menu surfing on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Huawei didn't stop there either and if this level of customization wasn't enough, there is an array of other advanced control methods and accessibility features as well. We already mentioned Film navigation, but sadly, it is only available on the bigger P8 along with other shortcuts that take advantage of certain tricks with the capacitive touch screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, motion control is present, just like in the P8, although it is also missing a few options. The gestures on the P8lite include flip, shake, double touch and draw. Oddly enough, the latter two are missing from the P8, which however has pick up, raise to ear and tilt on offer. It appears that each option is heavily dependent on existing hardware and it is not merely a case of removing things for the cheaper version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable the so-called Suspend button - it's a virtual key you can move anywhere on the screen, allowing you to expand it to the primary Android keys - Back, Home, Task Switcher, Lock and Close all running apps. It will help you control your P8lite single-handedly, but if that's not enough for you, there is always the dedicated One-hand mode - it uses the accelerometer to move the keyboard, the dialer and the navigation bar to the left or right side of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few other things from the P8 are also missing on its lite sibling. Some of which, like "speech awareness" obviously rely on dedicated hardware the P8 is lacking, but others we would have really loved to see, like Smart cover, Smart headset control and Knuckle recognition, but that is just nitpicking.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite is powered by a home-brewed HiSilicon Kirin 620 chipset. It is equipped with a total of eight Cortex-A53 processors, all clocked uninspiringly low at just 1.2 GHz. This is actually concerning for two main reasons. One, Huawei's Kirin chipsets have a really bad reputation of underperforming and two, the chip in question is significantly less-powerful and also older than the Kirin 930 inside the Huawei P8, which didn't do too well in our tests itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This all spells out major trouble for the P8lite. But the aforementioned Cortex-A53 cores might not even be the biggest problem the Kirin 620 is facing. It is bundled with a Mali-450MP4 GPU, which is far from competitive in today's mid-range market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we will be happy to pit the P8lite against some viable competitors and hope that the Kirin chip will surprise us for a change.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we already mentioned, the US version of the Huawei P8lite, bearing the model number - ALE-L04, is equipped with a more standard Snapdragon 615 SoC in place of the Kirin chip. It is currently the definitive and probably most popular mid-range option and we were quite pleasantly pleased to find that in most of the CPU-related tests, the Kirin scored pretty close to the Qualcomm alternative. We have included our benchmark results for the Snapdragon P8lite in the tables as well and will comment on some particular points later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is yet another mishap that seems to occur every time we review a Huawei device (one with a Kirin chip that is). At least a dozen models have passed through our office and consequently - the testing procedure and yet, we never seem to get two devices with the same chipset. As you can imagine, this mostly limits our ability to judge how well said SoC was implemented in a given device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it so happens, there are two other devices in our database with the Kirin 620 chip - the Huawei Honor 4X and Honor 4C, yet sadly, neither have paid a visit to the office. Thus, we are left with only one option in terms of similar hardware performance comparison and that's pitting the Kirin 620 against whatever other Kirin we can find, like we did with the P8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The closest we have managed to come is the Huawei Ascend Mate 7, with a Kirin 925, the Huawei Honor 6 - with a Kirin 920, the P8's predecessor - the Ascend P7, which runs on a Kirin 910T and the P8 itself (Kirin 930). We have included them in our comparison as reference points for how the P8lite compares to the rest of Huawei's lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the other chosen competitors, the Huawei P8lite happens to sit in a pretty mid-range price bracket. With an asking price of ?250 - ?300, there are a lot of viable alternatives to suggest and some veritable competitors to take on. It is also worth noting that the P8lite goes for about ?200 less than the premium P8, which is quite an impressive price drop, while still maintaining the general style and premium look and feel of the model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just a small note, the new EMUI 3.1 is based on Android 5.0, so, we would expect that the P8lite has all the benefits that the new code brings about at its disposal. So, to be fair, we have included, where possible, Lollipop benchmark scores for any other device on the list that has already received an update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, we have the raw CPU performance test with GeekBench 3, which should be straight-forward enough. Having eight cores is a definite plus, but with a clock speed of just 1.2 GHz, performance is not stellar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Huawei P8lite did manage to score surprisingly well in the pure computational department. Naturally, it got surpassed by the P8. Also the Acer Liquid Jade S did noticeably better, which is all but expected since it uses the Mediatek MT6752M, or in other words the very same eight Cortex-A53 cores, just clocked at 1.5 GHz. The situation is pretty much identical with the Meizu M1 note, which also has eight Cortex-A54 cores, but working even faster at 1.7 GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the Snapdragon 615 version of the P8lite, it sits pretty close to its sibling, so it appears the combination of four Cortex-A53 cores at 1.0 GHz and another four and 1.5GHs is pretty comparable to a 1.2GHz eight-core setup. The Qualcomm ship scored only slightly lower than the Kirin 620.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it is interesting to note that the Kirin 620 does seem to perform better, in terms of raw CPU power than the Snapdragon 615 in the Xperia M4 Aqua for example. It uses the very same number and type of ARM cores - four of which at 1.5 GHz and the other at 1.0 GHz.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. Here we see pretty much the same arrangement, only this time, the Huawei P8 takes the cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we already mentioned, this test is a lot more-subjective and easily influenced by any number of hardware and software factors of a given handset. For instance, the Mali-450MP4 GPU inside the P8lite surely brings down the score a notch. On the other hand, a custom OS like MIUM 3.1 is another huge factor and it could swing things both ways in terms of overall performance. Still, we are pleased to find the P8lite towards the upper end of the chart, so there might be hope for the Kirin 620. Furthermore, its Snapdragon 615 sibling once again scores a close second, confirming once again that whatever Huawei managed to do with the Kirin 620, it is, in fact, nothing short of a capable mid-range chipset.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Moving on to Basemark OS II, which is a truly all-round benchmark. Here, we get a first sight of the P8lite doing poorly in the overall scores. The result is most-likely due to the already mentioned poor GPU, which drags down the otherwise excellent number-crunching power of the eight core processor setup. It is also worth noting that the P8 had trouble with this particular test as well, so there might be some software optimization issues at play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the handset is a long way away from the bottom of the chart and definitely holds its own. Plus, as we can clearly see from the detailed single and multi-core performance charts, the low clock speed of the individual cores might have had a major influence on the overall score. This 1.2 GHz bottleneck is something to be weary of, as any app running on a single core will inevitably be limited in performance accordingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is where the Snapdragon 615 US P8lite gets a chance to shine. Thanks to its better Adreno 405 GPU, it did noticeably better in the graphics department, thus bumping up its overall Basemark OS II score significantly. This explains the substantial difference in the overall chart position and the almost identical results in the single and multi-core test breakdowns.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Graphics performance is where things definitely get rough. We already mentioned that the Mali-450MP4 is hardly a powerhouse, yet, surprisingly enough, it seems to perform better than the Mali-T628 MP4 inside the P8. This, however is mostly due to the fact that the latter is deplorable, especially on a FullHD screen. That is another advantage the P8lite has in this case - the 720p screen does help boost framerates quite a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another troubling observation to be made here. The Ascend P7 uses the very same Mali-450MP4 GPU and even has a Full HD screen. Yet, it scores only a couple of frames less than the P8lite in an onscreen test and better in the respective offscreen benchmark. This leads us to believe that there might be some severe optimization issues, most-probably related to the new EMUI 3.1 and the adoption of Android 5.0 Lollipop. Furthermore, we couldn't even manage to run a GFX 3.0 test on the Kirin chip. Hopefully, these issues will be ironed out in the future, as the poor performance is really unexpected, even for the Mali in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 615 version, on the other hand offers a very different graphics experience. Thanks to its superior Adreno 405 GPU, it managed to capture fourth place in the offscreen test and even top the onscreen one. It also had no problem running the GFX 3.0 Manhattan test, unlike its Kirin counterpart.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Speaking of poor OS optimization, there seems to be a lot more of it in terms of browser performance. Bear in mind, however, that the below scores are from the bundled default browser, which does seem to be based on Chrome, but an older version. Chrome, which is also included out-of-the-box does a significantly better job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is also worth noting that the Snapdragon 615 variant of the P8lite didn't really do a lot better in this department, so we point the finger squarely at the browser.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite benchmark performance is a mixed bag and not surprisingly, suffering from the choice of custom hardware. This, however, is only part of the story. Kirin chipsets have historically been bundled with rather meager GPU's and this one makes no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Kirin 620 does hold its own within its respective price range. This is a lot more than can be said for the P8, which simply seems to pricy for its own good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8lite can hold its own against the competition and despite the cited scores, the phone breezes through everyday tasks with no noticeable delay or stuttering in the UI. The 2GB of RAM without a doubt helps in this respect too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The US version fixes a lot of the GPU problems, so perhaps you are better off picking up a Qualcomm-powered unit - even at Android 4.4.4. Still, the international Kirin one is really not that bad, contrary to a lot of Huawei's past reputation. You really won't regret either choice for a mid-range android phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adapting EMUI for the Android Lollipop has taken its toll on GPU performance, which will hopefully be fixed come future updates. Still, if you are keen on doing a lot of graphics-intensive 3D gaming, or CPU-heavy work, the Huawei P8lite shouldn't be your first choice. For all other purposes, however, the device is fluid, responsive and a pleasure to use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite phonebook is laid out across three tabs that can be navigated by swipes. It actually resides in a single application along with the dialer and messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An alphabetical list on the right can help you jump to a specific letter or you can just use the search function. Tapping on a contact brings up a popup with access to a contact's scrollable info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As on most Android launchers, you can input a variety of contact information including custom ringtones and images. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook also supports blacklist option for blocking contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 held on to signal excellently and in-call sound was just fine. The proximity sensor makes sure the screen stays off when you hold the phone to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary noise cancelling on-board microphone ensures a quieter background for your voice while in call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the call log share the same screen. The dialer offers smart dialing and it works both with names and numbers. It can also be docked to one side or the other for easy accessibility, or, span the entire lengths of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the P8lite through our traditional loudspeaker test and it did manage to score a Good grade. The unit is far from loud, but still, stacked up against viable competitors, the P8lite does outshine most. It is quite interesting to note that the phone is noticeably louder than its high-end sibling - the P8.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual with all SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads. Attaching a photo, video, audio recording or the like automatically turns your message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite also comes with Hangouts, which is another way to handle texts. Hangouts can now integrate your SMS and MMS messages in addition to Gtalk and Google+ conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email, the Gmail app includes the four inbox options (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates) that Google recently introduced in their online interface. The default Email app is similar to Gmail, except that it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes, which is useful for when you want to keep track of multiple accounts from one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P8lite keyboard features some additional settings thanks to its Swype integration, including themes, split keyboard modes, and keyboard height, but sadly many of them are hidden within the input settings menu rather than as shortcuts from the keyboard like on most interfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, there is support for gestures as well as integration of Google's voice typing with their downloadable language voice recognition packs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Neat image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite, just like the P8, may run on an entirely new Android version, but, as already stated, MIUI 3.1 has borrowed a lot of its styling and features from its predecessor. The image gallery is one of them. It still offers a Timeline view, which sorts your images by the date you've taken them. It defaults to the Timeline view, but you can opt for the standard Album view with all of your images sorted in different albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a single image lets you quickly delete or rotate it, as well as gives you some basic sharing options (including streaming it over DLNA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go into a more capable editor with options for light and exposure adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), filters and beauty enhancements (which detects faces automatically).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is very intuitive and packed with options, including things like filters, effects, levels and even special watermarks for time, location, weather, food and mood. Every teenager would be pleased with the selection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it came to playing videos, the Huawei P8lite default player does a good job supporting every common video codec, but unfortunately it lacks support for AC3 audio as is usually the case with most Android phone anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't find a way to load subtitles. Not much else, however, is available in terms of options. It does have a neat floating windows video mode, but other than that, the player seems kind of basic. It still works great though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite comes with Huawei's custom music player app. It offers four default playlists - songs, artists, albums, folders. You can create your own playlists, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen is pretty standard, it offers album art and lyrics. There are no equalizers to speak off, but the app does have a few extra features. It would try to pull album art, song info and lyrics automatically for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice little touch is the ability to filter the songs by length, so no pesky ringtones show up in your library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a rather odd interface at the beginning of the app, which unlike all the other screens can't be accessed by swiping left or right. It is alike a pre app environment with a sort of song browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 has a built-in FM receiver. It can play through the headset or the loudspeaker, but you'll need to have the headset plugged in as it serves as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed not to find RDS support - you'll have to name your radio stations by hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is uninspiring<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Audio output is yet another corner cut when going lite as the mid-ranger couldn't quite replicate the performance of the Huawei P8. The smartphone had mostly very good readings when connected to an active external amplifier, but its volume levels were below average and so was the stereo quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones caused yet another hike in stereo crosstalk, making this one of the worst readings we've seen lately. Some intermodulation distortion also creeps in, but that's barely detectable to the naked ear. Still, with the loudness remaining disappointing we can't give this one too easy a recommendation to audiophiles.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Solid camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8 has a 13MP camera for maximum image resolution of 4160 x 3120 pixels. There's a dual tone LED flash to go with it. This is pretty close to what the bigger P8 offers, but there are still some cutbacks, like the lack of RGBW sensor and optical image stabilization. Still, the camera does use a BSI sensor, so we can expect good low-light performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is a very clean and simple. On the right side on each side of the virtual shutter button you get swipe controls that will take you into the photo and video modes. To activate the Burst mode you just need to press the camera shutter longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side is an advanced menu where you can choose from more shooting modes such as HDR and Panorama, and adjust things like object tracking, smile shutter, touch to capture switch, geo-tagging on/off, ISO, white balance, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do have one small grudge with the camera and the viewfinder in particular. It seems to be slightly smaller than the actual photo, which is hardly a problem, unless you are trying to frame something as precise as possible, like our sample posters, for example. The P8 has the very same annoying issue, so it is probably a common software bug.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite camera captures really decent photos, with plenty of resolved detail, accurate colors and edge to edge sharpness. Surprisingly, the digital noise in broad daylight is a bit more than we would have liked but it's nothing major. Shots came out pretty nice. The P8lite has really taken after the P8 in the camera department. Sadly, both seem to also be suffering from the same noise problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a set of samples with HDR manually enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up close, the P8lite does a pretty good job of focusing as well. Here is a macro photo to prove it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei puts a lot of emphasis on the P8's low-light photography capabilities, it is only logical that its smaller sibling try to emulate this as best it can. As already mentioned, it is void of a RGBW sensor, but still tries to compensate with its BSI hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Low-light photos are pretty good and were pleasantly surprised by the level of detail the phone picked up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the fun and artsy light painting and light trails modes are also missing on the P8lite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei P8lite takes high-res panorama images, with great stitching, excellent contrast and very good detail levels. Artefacts rarely occur, especially when shooting predominantly straight lines, like in buildings. Huawei has really been outdoing itself with the panorama software lately. Here are samples taken in both orientations of the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite has plenty of smartphones to contend with in our Photo compare tool, which lets you see just how it fares against other 13MP shooters. We've placed it up against its bigger sibling - the Huawei P8, to see if there is any noticeable difference in quality.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent 1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite offers 1080p videos at 30fps (well, actually around 29.7 for most of the time). Sadly, there's no 4K recording. There is a dedicated viewfinder for clips and, unlike the photo one, it seems to match up with the actual field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored as MP4 files and have a bitrate of around 10Mbps for 1080p resolution, 12 Mbps at most. There's stereo sound at 96Kbps, but the framerate varies quite a bit, but generally stays closer to 29fps than to the pivotal 30.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison the Ascend Mate7 put out a solid 25Mbps 1080p video at 30fps from its 13 MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result of the reduced bitrate, videos taken with the Huawei P8lite are quite lacking in detail and sharpness. Once again - the dynamic range could have been better and we really expected more resolved detail from the hardware at hand. Still this kind of performance is a lot more-acceptable in a mid-range device and intolerable in the high-end market segment, which is a definite minus for the Huawei P8, which exhibits much of the same problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here a sample we've uploaded on YouTube for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download a 1080p@30fps untouched video (10s ~ 13MB).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like its high-end sibling, the P8lite failed to impress with video quality. Clips came out blurry and with a low level of detail, mostly due to the lower bitrate. We still believe that this might be a temporary bug, caused by Huawei's transition to Android Lollipop in EMUI 3.1, so hopefully things will pan out soon. However, this is the current situation and we can only test the device as is. Plus, EMUI has been out for some time now on various devices and while spotty camera quality was somewhat understandable on the P8 back when it was a pioneer for EMUI on Android 5.0, now it is frankly inexcusable that the company still hasn't addressed this issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, quality is not catastrophic and there is still a lot to be taken away from the video compare tool below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most droids nowadays, the Huawei P8lite comes with two browsers to handle your web surfing needs. The stock browser offers largely the same functionality as Google's bundled Chrome browser (it is even based on its core), but we found the latter to be a more capable performer. Chrome also lets you sign in with your Google account and access open tabs and history from other sessions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the highlight of Huawei's homebrewed apps is the Phone Manager. It lets you control all sorts of features from call/message privacy and Do Not Disturb settings, to phone optimization and app permissions, to network and battery usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app features a one-touch optimization feature that frees up memory space and gives you settings recommendations for maximum battery performance. It's quite a slick feature that few manufacturers offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite comes with WPS Office, which handles document editing with ease. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs (both the 2003 and 2007 versions), it also opens PDF files and it doubles as a file explorer. It is quite good at digging out the documents stored across various folders on your phone, so everything is convenient to find.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a proper file explorer too - it has two tabs that divide your content between categories and a file explorer for internal and external storage. The app also handles ZIP and supports batch operations. It comes with a very useful Safe folder, for protected storage. Nice!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has included some nifty camera features in the Huawei P8lite, some of which are accessed as individual apps. The Magnifier is especially nifty for looking at stuff up close, while the markedly female-targeted Mirror apps lets you get a quick look at yourself, with included brightness adjustments and zoom options. Blowing into the microphone while the mirror is open is also good for a few kicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the standards, such as notes, calendar, world clock with stopwatch and timer, a calculator and a voice recorder. A handy flashlight app is also present. Nothing really special to point out here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you happen to run into any trouble while using the P8lite it has HiCare preinstalled. The app gives you easy access to manuals, forums and even live customer service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to getting around, the Huawei P8lite comes with Google Maps and Navigation. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Browsing Street view mode with digital compass enabled is an especially cool trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of owning a smartphone is getting new apps, and when it comes to Android, Google Play Store is the best source for getting your fill. From recommendations to top apps, it features a plethora of ways you can find new apps, and installing an app usually only takes a couple of taps.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Every way you look at it, the Huawei P8lite is without a doubt a gorgeous device. It has managed to capture the style of its premium sibling and has brought it over to the mid-range market where refined design is significantly harder to come by. The Huawei P8 definitely has its shortcomings, but undoubtedly, its biggest fault is the premium price tag that pits it up against a tough flagship crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the situation is quite different for the Huawei P8lite. With a more modest price tag of around &#x20ac;250, the he device stays clear from flagship territory and definitely manages to shine among its peers. Even the custom Kirin hardware that tends to plague high-end Huawei devices in the performance department is all good in the mid-range. Our tests show it is on par with the Snapdragon 615, which found in the US version of the handset and is widely used in upper midrange smartphones of all makes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8lite not only looks amazing, but holds up fairly well against its direct price competitors. The custom Kirin Kirin 620 SoC with its eight Cortext-A53 cores, clocked at 1.2 GHz, actually has quite enough power to handle any daily task you throw at it. Perspectives are definitely different when a mid-range price tag is involved, but still even the Mali-450MP4 isn't all that underwhelming. The same goes for the Snapdragon 615 version, which even has the benefit of a notably more capable Adreno 405 GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The truth is that unlike the P8, the P8lite has picked its crowd and place on the mobile scene just right, but before you get any false impressions of perfection, we would be the first to admit the handset is still rough around the edges. The new EMUI 3.1 definitely looks good on top of Android 5.0 Lollipop and it offers a number of advanced features, but the overall performance just isn't flawless. The absence of a lot of advanced functionality from the P8 is also disappointing, especially for features that don't seem to require any additional hardware to work. It almost seem like there has been some deliberate option plucking, which seems counterintuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera performance is another area of concern. Photos come out quite nicely, but video is a different story. Reduced frame rates produce disappointing results with a lot of blur and poor levels of detail. Our tests revealed that the P8 suffers from a surprisingly similar issues and we squarely point the finger at EMUI 3.1. It seems that the camera software still needs some work to play well with Android Lollipop and we can only hope that Huawei will resolve the issues soon. But, for the time being, you should probably avoid any of the two handset if you are demanding with your smartphone videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, there is a lot Huawei deserves credit for. The 5.0-inch 720p display is crisp and provides nice deep colors, 2GB of RAM are plenty for most tasks and you will be hard-pressed to find a more stylish and refined device in this price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the Huawei P8lite is a solid choice with few shortcomings. It is hard for us to suggest a viable contender in terms of aesthetics, but there are still a few nice options in the same price bracket for those of you who don't appreciate the poor camcorder quality or the custom hardware and software combination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Staring off with camp Samsung, there is a lot to look into. A mid-range price tag today can definitely buy you a yesterday's flagship device, or it his case the Galaxy S4 Black Edition. This device might be slightly outdated now, but there are still a lot of reasons to buy an older flagship. You can generally count on premium quality and an advanced feature set and in the case of Samsung - software updates and support, well at least to some extent. For one, the Galaxy S4 Black Edition already runs Android Lollipop and it has a FullHD SuperAMOLED screen and a great camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9506 Galaxy S4 &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy A5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you crave something more-recent, the Korean tech giant has you covered as well. The Galaxy A5 fits the bill perfectly. It is one of Samsung's new metal-body models and also shines with exquisite looks. Other than that, the devices are pretty comparable in terms of hardware. The Samsung has a slight edge in the screen department as it 5.0-inch display is Super AMOLED, but the Huawei has a slightly faster CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there are options outside Samsung. The LG G2 might also be getting on in years, but is still an excellent handset. Actually, its hardware surpasses that of the Huawei P8lite in almost every way, despite being two years old. The 5.2-inch True HD-IPS screen is not only bigger, but also offer Full HD resolution. And the Qualcomm MSM8974 Snapdragon 800 SoC is far from cutting edge, but definitely more-powerful than the Kirin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu also has a couple of fine alternatives in the same price range. The slightly older MX3 flagship is one. It is a really capable device worth looking into. And if you are seeking something more recent - the Meizu m1 note might be just right for you. It is slightly bigger than the P8lite with a 5.5-inch display, but we found it to be excellent in almost every way in our review. Not to mention its tantalizing price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Meizu MX3 &#x2022; Meizu m1 note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the Sony fans out there, the Xperia M4 Aqua is a perfect alternative to the Huawei P8lite. Its size is roughly the same and so is its hardware and you do get the added bonus of an IP68 certification, which guarantees water resistance. There is also a dual-SIM version, so Sony has that covered as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia M4 Aqua</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei P8ite really does match the best of two worlds. The exquisite styling of the P8 is beautifully and masterfully carried over to the more affordable device, without any obvious compromises. If it is good looks you are after, then you really needn't look further than the P8lite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly enough, the P8lite is also quick on its feet and holds its own in the hardware department. Huawei's custom chips have always been far from perfect, but when priced correctly and packaged up in such a stunning shell, they are no longer a drawback. You will get just as much power from the Kirin chip as any other current midrange offer form MediaTek or Qualcomm, making the P8lite a truly sensible choice.</paragraph>
