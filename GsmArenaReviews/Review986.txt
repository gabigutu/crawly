		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's ticking along nicely and it's almost hard to believe this is only its second season on its own. Having finally made their presence felt in the premium end, the Japanese are showing enviable focus and determination in bringing the middle ranks up to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good thing is they have a solid foundation to build on and the Sony Xperia L looks ready to take advantage. It picks up exactly where the Xperia U left off and tries to fix only what needed fixing, without overspending on gimmicks. A bigger screen, beefier battery and still resolution up from 5 to 8MP are things we wouldn't say no to. Yet, the expandable memory is what seems to be the most exciting piece of news.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia L is about to enter a segment that saw some of Sony's most compelling performers last year. This is no small responsibility but the L seems to have the right tools for the job. It comes across as one of the hottest prospect in Sony's lineup - one that's more likely to pleasantly surprise than disappoint. Let's take a closer look at what the Sony Xperia L has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L obviously cannot escape the issues that even the flagship had to deal with. In honesty though, it's a lot easier to get away with less than stellar contrast and viewing angles in the midrange. No Bravia and lower ppi than the Xperia U are the only things that don't sound right when you look at the lists above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This was a compromise obviously that had to be made and the reasoning must've been that screen size is what ultimately matters in this price range. Elsewhere though, the Xperia L is clearly superior and in ways that will make a real difference to the majority of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, a good enough display and adequate processing power are a start. The styling of the Bond phone was readily available - no points for creativity but in the end, the Xperia L has good looks and character with minimum effort. That's the thing here, Sony makes upgrading look so easy and it's a skill that sometimes evades even the most talented competitors. Let's see though if the Xperia L can keep it up. Make sure to check back in after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L is modestly accessorized - there's the essential USB cable and A/C adapter and some printed manuals in the box and that's it. There's no microSD card supplied, not even headphones, which isn't surprising for gadgets trying to stick to a budget. Naturally those things are strictly market-dependent so your mileage may vary.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia L 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L measures 128.7 x 65 x 9.7 mm and weighs the fairly high for its size 137g. It can be forgiven for being taller than the Xperia U, considering the notably larger screen, but if you compare it to the Motorola RAZR i, for example, you will immediately realize that Sony could have done a better job here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola smartphone is more than half a centimeter shorter, good 4mm narrower and thinner than the Xperia L, while packing a screen of identical size. What the Xperia L has to show for it is the fine inward curve at the back, which is a nice, if not original, accent.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L can claim some distant kinship with the Sony Ericsson Arc but it's a modern take on the old design and one that's respectful of the phone's rank too. The flat glass front does little to set the Xperia L apart from the entry-level Xperia E, but the slightly more prominent rear curve and the bigger screen will instantly tell you which one is the more advanced package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen bezels are by no means too wide but the too large blank bit below the screen is far from ideal. There's enough room on the sloped edge of the phone to rest your thumb, so leaving this much space here was certainly unnecessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary microphone is placed right at the edge of the bottom bezel. Above the display we find the earpiece, the front-facing VGA camera and the ambient light and proximity sensors. This time around there is no preinstalled screen protector like on the more expensive smartphones in the Xperia line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sloped bottom edge of the Sony Xperial L features the Illumination effect LED. Sony has gone for a simpler solution here, compared to the Xperia SP and, and while the LED will still match the color of the current theme or the image you are viewing, it doesn't have the full set of notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will still alert you for some events that require your attention (missed calls and messages), but you can't assign it as a caller ID and have it light up in different colors depending on who is calling you. Then again, unlike the Xperia SP's LED this one isn't visible from the back, so that wouldn't make too much sense anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The matte plastic back of the Sony Xperia L is removable and we like the feel of the soft finish. It's an interesting coating, as if hundreds of tiny white dots are sprinkled all over, sparkling under strong light - kind of like a metallic car paintjob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera lens is in the top left corner, a single LED flash next to it, and a loudspeaker grille centrally placed across at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curved edges allow a comfortable grip, and we don't mind them making the phone look chubbier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Sony Xperia L is a comfortable experience. The phone has an ample display but remains pocketable and easy to control.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's a 4.3" FWVGA (480 x 854) LCD on the Sony Xperia L, and no budget for Mobile BRAVIA. It's the same resolution as what the Xperia U has, but with the size increased by nearly an inch, the pixel density has dropped to just 228 ppi. It's clearly not the best you can get, but overall, the screen is reasonable for the price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness is adequate and the contrast looks good even without the Bravia engine optimizations - the colors look punchy and, all things considered, the screen is less likely to disappoint you than that of the flagship Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Sony Xperia L in bright outdoor conditions isn't the best experience. The glass on top of the display is reflective and the brightness isn't really enough to make up for it, so finding a proper angle for working with the Xperia L can be a bit tricky at times.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The prominent power button is a signature Sony accent that makes an appearance on the Xperia L as well. But the control that makes an even stronger statement is the hardware shutter key. The 8MP camera is central to the marketing of the Xperia L and Sony is genuinely trying to deliver the complete imaging experience. We tend to agree that a proper shutter key, half-press and all, is an important part of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, all the physical buttons on the Xperia L are on the phone's right side: volume rocker at the top, the power/lock key not far below and the camera key near the bottom. A long press of the shutter key unlocks the screen and launches the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Sony Xperia L is where the microUSB port is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm headphone jack is centrally placed at the top of the Xperia L and there's a secondary noise-cancellation microphone right above the camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom we find nothing but a lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoing the back panel is a bit tricky as you need to undo the top part and pop the phone out of its wrap. The risk of breaking the panel is minimal but it's still worth the caution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NFC transmitter is integrated within the back panel, under which we find the SIM card slot, microSD card slot and the 1750 mAh Li-Ion battery. You'll need to remove the battery to get to the SIM compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L scored an endurance rating of 39 hours, meaning an hour of calls, video playback and web browsing a day will require you to recharge every 39 hours or so. You can check out the detailed breakdown here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Jelly Bean user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia L runs on Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, on paper the same firmware ticking inside the latest Sony flagship, the Xperia Z. There are some differences and lacking features but the overall experience is quite similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back-end software optimizations, combined with Project Butter, give you as smooth a ride throughout the Xperia L UI as you can expect thanks to the powerful dual-core chipset and graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Xperia L in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has also updated its custom launcher to go with the new Android version it runs on. The Xperia L gives you the option to change the number of homescreen panes (by adding more or removing any of the default 5) and even select any of them as home. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also the background of the on-screen buttons is no longer gray and is much better looking in black now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done with a tap-and-hold on a blank area of a homescreen or using the pinch zoom out gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to perform various customizations on your phone - add widgets or shortcuts, change the wallpaper and the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it across to the homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia L has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The Timescape and Mediascape widgets are gone for good. Unfortunately, the widgets in the Xperia L do not resize or re-arrange automatically when you're trying to place them, even though Jelly Bean supports that feature natively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a new theme changes the lock and home screen wallpapers and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.). Depending on the theme you've chosen, the LED strip below the screen will light up in matching color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no overview mode like with previous Sony Xperia smartphones. Instead, you get the homescreen edit menu when you do the familiar pinching gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are five docked shortcuts (the app drawer shortcut and two on each of its sides). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them. You can also place whole folders there in which case you get smaller icons of the first four items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has been redesigned too. It uses cool new default animations and has two shortcuts for quick access to the camera (swipe to left) and to the dedicated music controls (swipe right). The hardware shutter key actually makes the camera shortcut redundant - it will launch the camera even if the device is locked. When the music player is active, the lockscreen will show the music controls by default, but you can hide them with a swipe if you want. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area is also present, and now features a few toggles switches (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Mobile Data). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is organized in pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. If you tap and hold on an app a green Add to Homescreen area will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon there and you will go back to your homescreens where you can put a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager of the Sony Xperia L is the same as on pure Android. It lacks the small apps and doesn't come with a "kill all" option. You can only swipe thumbnails to either side to remove the apps or select a thumbnail to be taken to the respected app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Data usage system service is onboard too. It also lets you set a limit for network data for a specific period and usage is broken down by apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L uses a Snapdragon MSM8230 chipset, which includes a 1.0 GHz dual-core CPU - a pretty solid processor for a midranger. It features an Adreno 305 GPU, which is the low-end member of Qualcomm's latest mobile graphics lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start off with BenchmarkPi and Linpack, where the Sony Xperia L posted pretty good scores, even it wasn't able to quite match the much more expansive smartphones we have in our database.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to overall testing, the Xperia L posted a score between the dual Cortex-A9 and the quad-core rivals, just as expected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've added a GPU benchmark for good measure to test out the Adreno 305 embedded into the Sony Xperia L. It got a 13 fps result in the off-screen test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 tests just about everything you can think off. The Sony Xperia L climbed over a thousand points which is impressive for its underpowered dual-core chip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider is based on JavaScript performance and it seems Sony need to better fine-tune the handset. Its score is decent, but the Krait architecture can certainly do better even at this relatively low clock speed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark 2 is an HTML 5-based benchmark, where the Sony Xperia L fared much better, but you should keep in mind that it's compared with much lesser chipsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vellamo focuses on JavaScript and HTML 5 and is where the Xperia L performed a stunner posting quite a good score just below the Samsung Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L did about as expected in the synthetic benchmark tests. It didn't turn out to be a performance champion, but it's better than many of its peers. More importantly it performs pretty smoothly in real life and we didn't experience lags or hiccups while operating the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now at your command<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know if there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Xperia L gets activated with a press-and-hold-and-upward-swipe of the virtual Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a review of all popular voice assistants and you can learn even more about Google Now there. Just follow this link.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L phonebook has also been upgraded since the last iteration under JB and, thanks to the light background, it looks livelier. The bottom bar holds shortcuts to search option, add number field, and the advanced settings menu. The tabs for Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs have been moved to the top and can be side-swiped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings a pop-up windows with shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too. This is where the LED strip comes into play as well. You can set a custom color for a contact, so the ambience light can serve as a caller ID of sorts. Of course you cannot possibly have a different color for every single contact in your phonebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia L was great. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation, so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad in the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia L automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Xperia L with xLOUD on and off. The results were equally impressive and got Very Good marks. With xLOUD off the Sony Xperia L even managed to set a slightly higher score, which is interesting. In reality we didn't notice the difference with our ears so you won't either but the oscilloscope did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia L offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable - the screen is big enough to house decently-sized keys that are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different skin, or even a new key layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Album gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can opt to show all of your albums in one place, and there are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can use pinch gestures to make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller. The whole thing is super responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids in a nifty animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Map reminds us of the iOS gallery, where all geotagged pictures are shown on a world map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab displays pictures from Google Picasa and Facebook. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos much like you did in the previous Xperia Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the LED strip below the display lights up with different color (similar with the image on the screen) every time you scroll through the pictures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy video player, plays everything but struggles with AC3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a new interface. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies you have preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia L did a great job with almost any file type and video codec we threw at it, including DivX and XviD. The only exceptions were MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio support - videos with this audio codec played but returned no sound whatsoever.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player we saw in Sony Xperia smartphones from the second half of 2012 is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it has more options for sound enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's a new ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music when listening on the pre-bundled Sony headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However dedicated audiophiles might want to consider alternatives off the Play Store, with support for a 10 or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app automatically seeks and bookmarks stations in range, although you'll need to have a set of headphones attached to use as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Play Music is on board as well. It went through a major UI overhaul and is now snappier and more beautiful. It features the spanking New Listen Now feature which tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen uses the song album art and gives you a quick shortcut to the rest of the artist's songs along with the play controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L performed excellently in the first part of our traditional audio quality test and was about on par with the mid-range Xperia SP and even high-flying Xperia Z. The smartphone got great scores all over, and if it wasn't for its below-average volume levels, it would have been pretty great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones, but things certainly aren't too bad. The stereo crosstalk rises notably and some distortion creeps in. Volume levels remain pretty low, but the overall performance is still quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 MP camera does well for the class<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L is equipped with an 8 megapixel camera that can produce still shots with a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes and is unified with the camcorder one - you can start snapping away or shoot a video without the need to change modes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, video and still shot shutter keys, and a primary/secondary camera toggle. On the left you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three customizable shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all available settings for the given shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia L camera offers all kinds of features, including face detection, smile shutter, geotagging, touch capture and HDR mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera shortcut on the lockscreen does. You can go for simply launching the camera in either still or movie mode, or you can set it to immediately snap a photo/start capturing video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This might come in handy for those occasions when you are worried that you might miss a shot, but it is also useful for when you don't want to waste your battery keeping the camera interface constantly going (it's a real battery hog).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Sony Xperia L camera left us with mixed feelings. It resolves a decent amount of fine detail and while saturation is good, colors are often off. Noise is fairly high as well, so the overall output is hardly the best in the 8MP league. Then again, there's quite premium competition there, so the Xperia L still remains one of the most competent shooters in its class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode is available too, helping you bring extra dynamic range to both the shadows and highlight ares of your shot. It's quite quickly, but the over-exaggerated HDR effect might not be everyone's cup of tea as it gives images a very unrealistic look.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p video with HDR is nothing to write home about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L is capable of capturing 720p video footage at 30fps, which is what you'd expect from a lower-midrange device in today's market. However, as a nice extra touch, the smartphone also offers HDR for video capture, making it one of the few devices to have this feature especially in this price bracket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came as a disappointment for us is the fact that even though the Xperia L is able to capture still shots while recording video, it only produces images at 1MP resolution - which is the same as extracting a frame from the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>More crucially though, Sony Xperia L just doesn't record good video. The clips shot with it look like upsized VGA footage as they lack detail and look all pixelated. Colors are good and framerate is steady at 30, but the lack of detail really ruins the whole experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough videos have more than enough bitrate at about 12 Mbps mark, so you can't really blame it on compression. There's stereo audio recording at a 94 Kbps bitrate, which while low is still more than most other mid-rangers can offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR videos are also present on the Sony Xperia L and unlike some other implementations we have seen they do make a difference. However, with the video quality so poor in general, there's barely much sense in shooting HDR either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a 720p@30fps sample for direct download.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L joins our video quality comparison pool. We've chosen the Galaxy S III mini and Nokia Lumia 720 as its rivals but you can choose any other. Sadly in this competition the Xperia L falls into non-relevance all too quickly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L has quad-band 2G and up to quad-band 3G connectivity depending on your regional model. Mobile data speeds can hit the impressive 21 Mbps of HSDPA and 5.8Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and PC connectivity, and there's also USB On-the-go so you can attach external flash drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media Remote isn't preinstalled on the Xperia L but you can get it off the Google Play Store for free. It will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. There are a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history. This sort of a remote only works over the Wi-Fi connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board the Xperia L.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia L comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, which replaces the former LiveWare manager, although the functionality remains basically the same. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is the sole web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia L comes with Google Chrome as the only web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. The minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with the settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi range and want to go easy on your data plan, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's deeper settings, you'll also have the option to turn form auto-fill and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome does not support Adobe Flash, and neither does Android Jelly Bean in the first place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L comes with the older version OfficeSuite 6 viewer. OfficeSuite 6 lets you view almost any type of document, although you'll have to buy the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Notes app that comes with the Xperia L. It's pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note and just start typing or doodling. There's also Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver setting helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold, turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off the mobile data when the screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and it also offers advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are available within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in another city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're looking for even more organizational options, the Google Play store is full of free apps that can cater to all your needs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps with offline maps, online navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia L comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia L comes with Google Maps and Navigation (region dependent). Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's app uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache Berlin and parts of the surroundings before Maps told us the area is too big. There's no address search either in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab another from the Android Market - there are both free and paid alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store is the gate to the app world<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running Android Jelly Bean, the Xperia L has access to the latest apps and the microSD-expandable memory guarantees you won't have trouble with storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has a plan and is sticking to it. Not a piece of tactical genius either but one that seems to work for it. A couple of phones did well for Sony in the midrange last year and the right touches here and there was all they needed to be highly competitive again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked it how the Xperia SP built on the Xperia P and the Xperia L would've been foolish not to adopt the same strategy. Bigger screen and battery, memory expansion and a seriously good camera for the price - there you go - last year's great midrange package is relevant again, in three easy steps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Jelly Bean too, which may not be the latest version available, but way better than Gingerbread, on which the Xperia U launched at a time when ICS was widely available. Add the styling of the ex-flagship and things are looking good for the Sony Xperia L.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we said, not a massive effort but one that might just pay off generously. The way we see it, the lack of full-HD video and a screen that's acceptable, but not impressive, are the biggest question marks. Elsewhere, the Xperia L is looking quite convincing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S II Plus features a 4.3" Super AMOLED Plus display of WVGA resolution, has great 8 MP camera, Jelly Bean, expandable storage. Its chipset is certainly inferior to the Krait-powered Xperia L, but the display image quality comparisons go in its favor. Priced about the same as the Sony Xperia L, the midrange sequel of the once proud flagship is worth checking out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9105 Galaxy S II Plus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC doesn't have an up-to-date alternative but last year's One S should be very much in consideration. With an attractively thin body (at 7.8 mm) and the impressive ceramic finish, the one S not only looks the part but means business with a qHD (540 x 960) Super AMOLED display and dual-core 1.5 GHz Krait. It costs a bit more than the Xperia L, though, and being over an year old now it's got slim chances of getting its Android version updated in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over at Windows Phone, the HTC Windows Phone 8X shapes up as one of the most likely options to consider. It packs a 720p screen and faster dual-core Krait processor, but is larger than the Xperia L despite not offering a bigger screen. It costs more than the Xperia L, too, and given the inferior productivity of the Microsoft platform compared to Android, it will only appear to very casual users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Windows Phone 8X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Xperia L is a package that fits in its midrange spot nicely. It's an adequately powered smartphone and an above average cameraphone. There seems to be enough appeal there for common-sense buyers - and that's something to build on. Without a doubt, the Xperia L should be grateful to the Xperia U for the momentum and to Sony, for doing the right thing.</paragraph>
