			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For the original LG Prada the best way to travel in style was to travel light. But this time around it's carrying a full QWERTY suitcase packed with goodies. Top of the line functionality and an updated interface sound just the right kind of luggage to us. But good enough won't do if it's not glam enough. The new LG KF900 Prada may seem like the missing link between the techie high end and exclusive fashionware. But will HSDPA, Wi-Fi, QWERTY and DivX ring the right bell with the target audience?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last week we saw Samsung ride on the Emporio Armani youth appeal and now we're back by the catwalk with the more moderate, perhaps even conservative, but nonetheless attractive, new Prada phone by LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we've got loads to cover. Are the changed form factor and the QWERTY keyboard likely to backfire, and will performance ever be make or break for the fashion savvy? Rarely has a designer package promised so much action, so let's roll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It was about time the first Prada phone by LG got an update, no doubt about that. Data transfers, connectivity, multimedia and user interface upgrades are spot on, but a hardware QWERTY keyboard was hardly essential. It's the Prada phone after all, and it probably needs all those buttons as much as the Sonim rugged phones need a Dolce &amp; Gabbana carrying case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, all-in-one QWERTY touchscreens are obviously the new black. Or so the LG KF900 Prada believes. Keen to find a niche within the niche, it lands right in the middle of not so friendly smartphone crowd. It's got the features to stand up to the XPERIA, HTC and the likes but it's kinda hard to imagine the ruthless WinMo machine melting with pity for the adorable, helpless, irresistible Prada.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we think we'd be better off skipping our traditional round of window shopping this time. After all comparing the Prada to the smart messengers running Symbian or Windows Mobile will be irrelevant and unfair. There will be of course references to equally equipped messengers as we go, for both performance and looks, but that will be all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't find any other handset willing to embrace the LG KF900 Prada concept. The QWERTY touchscreen all-in-one segment is a small niche to begin with, and the haute-couture label narrows it down even further. The new Prada phone by LG finds itself in a difficult position so let's see if it's got what it takes to make the best of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Join us on the next page, as we explore the exterior and ergonomics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package - quite a catch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF900 Prada comes in an all-black leather cube of a box that's at least as stylish as the phone tries to be. On top is the handset and with all the accessories underneath, each in its own small package. That arrangement we saw in the first Prada and the Secret later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of stuff inside the big box so prepare for a long unpacking. Boy, it feels like Christmas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the essentials. There is a charger, USB-cable, cleaning cloth, CD with software and a manual. The supplied hard leather case is the same as the one that came with the original Prada, of duly increased size of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Prada entourage also includes a stereo headset with a rather chunky remote, attachment clip and a 3.5 mm jack adapter, so you're not stuck with the Prada branded earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Prada phone comes along with 1GB microSD card. The 256MB card that came with the original Prada seems so helplessly dated but we're not sure 1 GB quite cuts it at the top of the line either. Anyway, cards of greater capacity are perfectly compatible. The KF900 handled a 16GB microSD card just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also made available another fashionable accessory for the Prada phone - the LG Prada Link wristwatch. Sold separately, the Bluetooth-equipped Prada Link wristwatch seems like an excellent companion for the new Prada phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, as we didn't receive a sample Prada Link in our office, we can't really comment on its features beyond what was stated officially by the manufacturer. It's an elegant digital wristwatch, which is Bluetooth-enabled so that can remotely monitor the Prada phone calls as well as allow you to read full SMS text messages. On top of that, the timepiece is water resistant, so you can keep track of your calls and messages while taking a bath or resting in the pool.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG KF900 Prada 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even if the LG KF900 is notably thicker than the original Prada, it is still a pocketable device and the inbuilt QWERTY keyboard is enough of an excuse for the few extra millimeters around the waist. The new LG Prada is about the size of the XPERIA X1, only not as tall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to weight though, the difference is well justified. The all plastic Prada messenger weighs 130 g, which is 15 g less than the XPERIA.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original Prada was more of a fashion accessory - the first touchscreen GSM phone by LG and the haute couture label were the features that stood out clearly against the unimpressive spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new release is a major upgrade in weaponry - interface, connectivity, multimedia - but there's nothing on the exterior to suggest that. The two Prada phones look such complete clones on the outside that the QWERTY keypad becomes the most eye-catching - though hardly most important - feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the front of both Prada phone you almost can't tell the difference. The front facing camera is the only tip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black and chrome combination remains intact. And again, the body is all plastic, including the chrome-finished elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right on top of the display, is the centrally placed earpiece. The Prada logo is below and the top right corner hosts the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the front is the 3" capacitive touchscreen display. The use of capacitive technology means the contact with the screen is possible only by fingers - no stylus or nails. However the thing is more sensitive than the regular resistive touchscreens that most LG touch phones use. The original Prada phone also had the same type of the display, as well both Apple iPhones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Prada display size and resolution (240 x 400 pixel, WQVGA) are the same as in the first GSM touch phone by LG two years ago - the original Prada phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right under the screen are the only hardware controls found on the LG KF900 Prada - a Back key squeezed in between the Call and End/Power buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot if on the right-hand side of the phone. It is covered with a lid to keep away dirt and dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right under it are the touchscreen lock knob and the Launcher/Multitasking key. It opens a tabbed menu where the first tab displays shortcuts to user-defined favorite features while the second hosts the Task Manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the help of the Task Manager you can get to the home screen without closing the application you are currently using and you can also have several Java apps running in the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last control on the right side of the Prada 2 is the shutter key. The camera on the Prada messenger is auto-focus enabled, so the shutter key gets pressed in two steps. The camera key is OK to use, with a distinct half press but most often than not pressing it slides the back part of the device down so using it takes some extra patience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you'll find the volume rocker. It is chrome-finished (like all side controls) and quite comfortable to use. It also serves as a zoom lever in the camera but is of questionable value: you'll need to press it with your left thumb, while holding the handset in landscape position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the handset's top is the charger/headset connector which, like the memory card slot, is covered by a protective cap. On its left is the lanyard eyelet. Only the mouthpiece is to be found at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all-black, all-plastic rear clearly takes after the original Prada phone. The camera lens, LED flash and the small self-portrait mirror are placed in the top left corner, all within a stylish metal plate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the original Prada phone, the camera lens was in between the flash and the mirror, while now it's the first in line. It is right in the very top corner of the body, and we did end up with a finger across the lens quite too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no latch for releasing the battery cover. A tiny knob provides a thumb rest to gently slide the cover downwards. By the way, the same knob keeps the exposed camera lens from rubbing against any surface when the phone is laid on its back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF900 Prada battery life won't let you down. The 950 mAh unit gets you covered for a good two days of fairly extensive use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Direct comparisons to, say, the 1500 mAh battery of the XPERIA would be irrelevant, as the Prada phone has neither the screen resolution nor the smartphone platform of its Sony Ericsson counterpart. It's more like Renoir's 1000 mAh battery, which we were more than happy with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF900 Prada handles quite comfortably and its build quality is just fine. For the time of testing we didn't note any unwelcome rattles and creaks in the casing. The controls are altogether friendly and the slider action smooth and solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is hardly a match for the intimidating solidity of the XPERIA but stays faithful to the original Prada styling. The all plastic case feels quite durable. The only turnoff is the fingerprint-prone piano black finish, which makes a mess of the handset, so the supplied cleaning cloth will be put to much use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display - no stylus needed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KF900 Prada has the display of its predecessor in terms of both size and resolution, but most importantly - they share the same capacitive touchscreen technology. In layman's terms, it's either your fingertips or bust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF900 Prada screen supports multi touch, which is a treat in web browsing and photo viewing. All it takes to zoom in is a pinch on the screen. By the way, comparison with the iPhone is inevitable - the Apple iPhone screen is built on the same technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the pinch zooming is quite unpredictable - sometimes it zooms more than you expect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KF900 Prada display is vibrant and detailed. Brightness is adjustable, but contrast isn't. The screen is quite usable outside on a bright sunny day, but sunlight legibility is not the best we've had.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comparison to handsets like HTC Touch HD and XPERIA X1 is definitely not in favor of the Prada phone. But while the display resolution is a weak spot, touchscreen sensitivity and interface response is impressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good QWERTY keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard is a defining feature of the new Prada phone by LG. It does put the handset in a rather tight niche where competition is lower but tougher. Well, at least in QWERTY terms, the LG KF900 Prada has nothing to be ashamed of. Its slide-out keyboard is comfortable, tactile and responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Buttons are 7 mm wide and there is 1.5 mm space between them. Each key is raised and etched at the bottom, resulting in tangible terracing of the rows. The press is solid and touch orientation quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Prada QWERTY keyboard is slightly better than the XPERIA's in terms of key size and tactility, and overall comfort of use. Both handsets share a major weakness though -inadequate headroom for the top row of keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the QWERTY keyboard out, the screen automatically flips landscape mode. Pressing any of the number keys launches the dialing screen. If you slide the keypad back in while dialing, the digits you typed remain on screen so you can pick up where you left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad backlighting is very adequate, the solid white illumination making the handset both attractive and quite comfortable to use in the dark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The familiar UI with multi-touch upgrade<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The KF900 Prada uses the latest Flash-based touch user interface by LG. The first handset we saw that in was the LG KE850 Prada, subsequently followed by the LG KU900 Viewty, the LG KF700 and finally in the 8MP cameraphone LG KC910 Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go on a trip through all the menus, we must mention of one really interesting upgrade of the LG Prada 2 user interface. The latest Prada phone has multi-touch support, which makes it the second multi-touch handset in the world after the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've played with the Apple gadget already, you know the difference it makes and what it feels like. If you don't - well you've certainly heard about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, much like on the iPhone, with the capacitive touch display the contact with the screen is possible only by fingers - no stylus or nails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are rather surprised to see that the user interface of the LG Prada 2 is quite faster and more responsive than the LG Renoir implementation, which tended to get on our nerves at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video demoing the LG Prada 2 interface - from the new optional layout of the main menu through the cube-like 3D home screen to multi-touch zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG made a very strange decision to remove the option for re-arranging the main menu icons, which we praised in the Renoir. The items are fixed again, just like in the Viewty, so you'll have to like it or lump it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, the LG KF900 Prada interface auto rotates when you turn the handset to landscape mode but only in selected applications such as the image gallery, video player or the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This screen rotation however works every time you slide open the QWERTY keyboard. Rotation is smooth and the phone reacts promptly to your movement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you slide the keyboard out the homescreen even changes its layout and some new shortcuts appear allowing you to start a new message or go through some other applications such as image gallery, web browser, calendar, memo, and to-do's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the LG Renoir, the LG Prada 2 has three different homescreens which you can switch between by swiping your finger across the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This causes them to rotate like the sides of a pyramid, creating the illusion of 3D. The first one is the customizable screen with widgets. The second is empty, decorated only with the Prada and operator logo. The last one is used for quick access to applications through customizable shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Three is certainly better than one and we are delighted by this new addition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG have also added some Prada-themed content on the device. There are a bunch of wallpapers for example picturing fashion models presenting Prada collections on the catwalk. Each time you lock the phone the wallpaper automatically changes to a new one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also exclusive ringtones and videos on board - nothing too special though. If you are interested at all the exclusive content on the Prada 2, you can check the Download section over at PradaPhoneByLG.com as it's all listed there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Widget me this<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You probably know all about widgets by now. Samsung use those on various phones, LG have already implemented them in some ways in their past touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We saw the most advanced widget home screen by LG so far on the LG Renoir and despite some of its imperfections it was generally welcomed by our team.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might remember that on the Renoir you can enable all of the available widgets on home screen and then scroll through them. Unfortunately, on the LG KF900 Prada that's no longer an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead there is a nice choice to automatically realign them by shaking the phone (the same feature is present on LG Cookie as well).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the LG Renoir, the LG Prada 2 comes with only 7 widgets - an analog clock, a world time clock, a calendar, FM radio, Music player, Notes and Image slideshow. The missing bits include the digital clock and the dedicated weather application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately new widgets cannot be added. That is the main disadvantage when compared with the competing Samsung TouchWiz interface used in the Pixon.</paragraph>

		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Step into the den<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main menu of the new Prada phone is identical to that of the LG Renoir. For those who don't remember or have never seen them, let's take a look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the LG Prada 2 home screen you will find a navigation bar with shortcuts sitting at the bottom of the screen - just as in the previous LG touchscreen phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four available shortcuts are not user configurable. The first shortcut takes you to the Dial pad to punch in a number, the second opens the Contacts list, the third one opens the Messaging submenu, and the last one takes you to the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from that, the user interface of the LG KF900 Prada retains the same menu system as the LG Viewty and Renoir - simple, yet nicely detailed and functional. LG have done a really nice job designing the user interface and we are impressed with the improvements they make with every new handset they release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu consists of four tabs - they are displayed in a column on the right-hand side of the screen. They don't have names but the first one is related to making calls and sending messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab includes tools such as the web browser, world time, organizer applications such as the Calendar, Calculator, Unit converter, etc. And, finally, the fourth item handles all the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third one is the entertainment menu: this houses the multimedia files, the camera, the FM radio, the games, and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are familiar with the first Prada, then it will come as no surprise to you that the user interface comes with a choice of two themes - a black and a white one. Unlike all other touchscreen LG handsets, the icons in neither of the themes are colorful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But, that's not all. There is a new view style for the main menu called Plate. Instead with tabs, it splits all the items into a 2x2 grid. Moving from one grid to the other takes a single swipe across the screen. A small icon in one of the corners shows what your current position is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An absolute must-have for every full touch-operated handset, and a feature we miss in the Apple iPhone (well, we used to - not any more thanks to some smart third-party developers), is some sort of feedback when the screen is pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Prada 2 is haptic-enabled of course: every press is accompanied by a gentle vibration to let you know your press has been accepted. Settings for it include a choice of four types of vibration plus 7 levels of vibration strength. The included types of vibrations are much better than the LG Renoir since each one is distinctly different when you touch the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF700 was the first touch handset by LG to make use of a task manager and the concept has been extended to the LG Renoir and the new Prada as well. You can run several Java and native applications simultaneously and effortlessly switch between them by using the dedicated side key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager on the LG KF900 has a new "launcher" tab that hosts a number of configurable shortcuts to various applications. The list is scrollable so you can fit quite a few on there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing borrowed from the KF700 and the Renoir is the Status screen - touching on any of the icons on the top status row (next to the clock) opens up a screen that displays signal, battery and memory stats and allows you to quickly toggle the ringing profiles, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is good, nothing has changed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook capacity offered by the LG KF900 is up to 1000 contacts, each with its own set of details. You can organize your contacts into caller groups, and you can also assign them a personal picture and a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a bunch of available fields for each contact on your list - you start off with twelve fields, but once you enter a number, an additional number field becomes available. The same goes for email, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add a note to a contact and when you enter the birthday field, you can also have the phone save the date to the calendar as a reminder. In fact the LG Prada 2 has the same phonebook as the Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling the contacts list is fluid and friendly. In fact, LG have done a great job with scrolling throughout the user interface and it's as smooth and enjoyable as on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't want to go through all the contacts to reach those which start with "Z" for example, you can either use the search box at the top or you can drag the side scrollbar, which allows you to jump letters alphabetically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can opt to display the SIM and phone contacts separately, as well as together in a single list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Prada handles phone calls trouble-free, as you have every right to expect, The phone dialer works with an on-screen numeric keypad - or in keyboard open mode you can use the assigned number keys on the QWERTY.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is support for both Smart Dialing and Speed dial is supported. When you have speed dial set up and you hit an assigned key, you get the details of the contact in question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any LG handset - the left receiver key (quite awkwardly backlit in red as the right one) takes you to the list of all calls. You can access them from the main menu too, but unlike the previous LG handsets, you won't find call time counters and the web data counter here since those have been moved to the Call settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF900 Prada scored an Excellent mark in our loudspeaker performance test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the Prada stacks up against some other handsets we've tested. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Amazing messaging, not so email client<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Prada supports sending and receiving SMS, MMS, and email messages. Much like the Viewty and Renoir, SMS and MMS share the same editor but the Prada lacks certain features such as the onscreen QWERTY (you do have a hardware one to compensate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For typing you can use either the virtual multi-tap alphanumeric keyboard, or you can rotate the Prada and use the hardware QWERTY. As you might guess, typing with the QWERTY keyboard is very fast and easy and we highly recommend it. The buttons are bigger than on the XPERIA and much more comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only input methods missing here are handwriting recognition and an on-screen QWERTY keyboard, but we can't imagine anyone would need them with these great physical keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to emails, the LG Prada deals with them hassle free. Setting up an email account (one or more) is a breeze thanks to the clever setup scheme. For a Gmail account for example, all we had to do was fill in the account and password fields - the connection settings were retrieved automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there are a host of settings that you are able to enter. You can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported and the email client supports SSL too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no option for configuring the sending limit and the default size is 1MB, meaning you can't even send most of the images taken with its five-megapixel camera. The size limit on the LG Renoir is 2MB, easily enough to send any images taken with its 8 megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, archive files such as ZIP or RAR are not among the supported file types for attachments, but still you can save those to the phone memory when you receive them. MS Office and PDF files can be opened and viewed directly inside the email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've downloaded your messages, you can use the search feature to find specific emails or you can sort them by various filters such as date, sender, priority, read/unread, subject, size, etc. There is also an option for setting multiple emails as "Read".</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The multimedia performance is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada 2 comes with 60MB of internal memory and of course it's expandable via the microSD memory card slot. Hot-swapping a memory card is easy. We can also confirm that 8GB and 16GB microSD cards worked fine on our unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File browsing is generally fast but when you have a memory card inserted, each time you open the file browser it refreshes the image thumbnails automatically. If you have a lot of images (800+ in our case) it can really get annoying as the whole thing can take up to a good 15-20 seconds to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another bad impression is left when the half or nearly full memory cards holds a variety of different files. Then, opening the memory card or even listing files in the main folders may take more than 20-30 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't use external memory or the card isn't full, you won't notice any serious lag while file browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another drawback is that no matter what file sorting you opt for (date, type, name), the files on the memory card always get listed first. While that doesn't sound like a big deal, it should have been up to the user to decide, not software engineers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF900 Prada file manager appears as the My Stuff item in the menu. It includes separate factory-preset folders for different file content. The Prada had no problem reading custom folders off the memory card, unlike some midrange LG phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery - just like the iPhone one<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG have vastly improved their image gallery with the LG Renoir and that holds true for the new Prada phone as well. It offers a great touch experience and flicking through images feels so natural that it's the first time we've seen a phone handle picture-viewing as smoothly as the Apple iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse images in portrait or landscape mode just by changing the orientation of the handset itself. Zooming images is easy because of the multi-touch support. It only takes a pinch (much like on the Apple iPhone) to zoom in on a photo. The reverse gesture zooms out. You can see it demonstrated in the short video we've posted on page 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately sometimes the software completely misinterprets your gesture - small zoom levels are taken for high or the vice-versa. This is a problem that persists in the browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KF900 Prada also has an image editor that offers a wide range of options. First off, you get a creative part that allows finger drawing on images, text typing, clipart watermarking, face morphing, selective colorization, and selective color boosting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then you have options for basic image treatment tools such as rotate, resize and mirror, as well as more advanced photo editing options such as levels, brightness, contrast, color, hue and saturation, sharpness and blur. Red-eye removal is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can add color effects such as black &amp; white, sepia, negative, glow, etc. An extra feature to the image editor is Face beautify, which softens skin and enhances skin tones. However, it doesn't really function as well as claimed, and we had several instances of enhancements being applied to only parts of the subject's face resulting in rather ugly contrasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another enhancement that's not available in the feature-rich editor but can be applied in the file browser (strange, isn't it?), is an enhancement pioneered on the LG Viewty called Smart Light, which ups the exposure of photos taken in dim light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, despite the rich features of the editor, we think it scores low on usability since the different options are inconsistently spread through various menus. Nevertheless, we highly doubt that most users will edit photos on their mobiles anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Prada has almost the same Music player as the LG Renoir. You can filter tracks as with any other up to date music player - by artist, album, genre, and recently played. User-created playlists are also an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no available visualizations. The only other option is Album art but it's a really nice treat as the album image gets as large as one third of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the music player can run in the background. If you want you can control the music straight on the home screen with the dedicated widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player interface has changed a bit since the Renoir. Besides the larger album picture, the dedicated buttons for sound, repeat and shuffle are moved down to the right corner. And as you can see from the shots the three music buttons are bigger and more touch-friendly than on the Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The missing equalizer options in the Renoir are now history and the Prada 2 has five different presets available to the user.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Prada comes with FM radio and you can use it either through headphones or through the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the headphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio stores up to 50 stations and there is support for receiving two-line radio station info over RDS. Scrolling through stations is very easy and intuitive - you have quick access through the two rows of buttons below the main window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the music player, when the FM radio is running in the background you can control it using the home screen widget.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF900 Prada did decently in our audio quality test, recording excellent noise level and dynamic range readings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distortion levels are also one of the best we have seen recently. The frequency response graph indicates the existence of some mid and high-pass filter that cuts out the extremely low frequency sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo crosstalk reading however is simply disastrous. This is an anti-record in our test indicating that the handset is basically lacking stereo capabilities ? a good portion of what is played in one channel is also received through the other. However the score is so bad that it almost certainly has something to do with the pre-release status of our unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves. More info about the test can be found by following the link.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player accepts DivX<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Prada video player is among the most attractive features of the handset due to its support of DivX - still a rare feature on most mobile phones. This enhanced video support is not even listed in the official specs list or commercials, so we are pleasantly surprised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KF900 successfully played most of the DivX movies we threw at it walking in the boots of LG Renoir. However, the Prada does not do XviD at all - either officially or unofficially.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the widescreen display, wide aspect videos are a treat in fullscreen landscape mode. The semi-transparent control overlay disappears in a few seconds or when you tap on the screen so they don't get in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an elaborate video editor on board as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Online video - still in the dark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Prada does not come with any form of YouTube integration. You can't upload videos to YouTube directly from the handset as you can with the Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the LG Prada web browser doesn't have Flash support, so watching YouTube videos from the desktop version of the web site is a no-go. The same holds true for the previous LG hi-end handsets too - Viewty and Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only way to watch your favorite videos is via the mobile version of YouTube.com where videos get streamed in 3GP format over the RTSP protocol. If that's more mumbo-jumbo than you can handle, here's what it means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mobile version of YouTube found at m.youtube.com gets you access to the same videos as the desktop version, however they are of inferior in quality so that they can be played over the wireless carrier network - EDGE or UMTS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strange as it may seem, the Prada only allows you to watch streaming media (of any type) over an EDGE or UMTS connection (just as in the Renoir), - which means you cannot watch streaming mobile YouTube videos over Wi-Fi. This is odd since the Wi-Fi option is available in the streaming menu, but the Prada just refuses to accept it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the retail version of the device will have those bits and pieces sorted out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And since we've noticed a lot of Renoir users didn't realize this, here's a tip for you - to watch streaming videos (such as YouTube) you first need to set up the streaming settings of the phone to use the same internet profile as your mobile web browser. The place you do that is in Settings tab&gt;Connectivity&gt; Streaming settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have no Internet profile setup at all, you need to define an access point first (enter the carrier settings) and then you have to create an Internet profile that uses this access point. After you're done, just go and set up the Streaming options to use that same Internet profile. You can use the same one for the web browser, too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera is frustrating<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new LG Prada comes with a Schneider-Kreuznach lens. As there are only a few 8 megapixel cameraphones currently, 5 megapixels still counts for something. The maximum image resolution the LG KF900 Prada provides is 2592x1944 pixels. Video recording is about as good as you can get on a mobile phone - 720x480 pixels at 25 frames per second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Schneider-Kreuznach is an acclaimed manufacturer of industrial and photographic optics. In fact the company has won several Oscars awards for Technical Achievements (yes, the Hollywood type of Oscars).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't know how much of the winning technology made it to a lens for a mobile phone but one thing is certain - putting Prada and an Oscar in the same sentence attracts a lot of attention. But we digress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5-megapixel camera the te Prada 2 is equipped with is a sizeable improvement over the two-megapixel snapper found on the original Prada phone by LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface has been updated too and now looks closer to that of the Renoir. Unlike the Renoir however you now get to choose whether the viewfinder should go fullscreen (effectively cropping the top and bottom) or it should fit the entire frame on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That last fit-it-all option leaves two black bars on the left and right of the viewfinder, but that's quite understandable as the screen aspect ratio and the camera sensor ratio are different. We've got to say that this is our preferred viewfinder mode with the LG Prada. Still, we would have enjoyed the company of several permanently visible shortcuts on those unused side bars - what a waste!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another hit on usability is that quite often pressing the side shutter key slides the LG Prada 2 open. It's a small annoyance but nonetheless one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a workaround of course - you can use the virtual shutter key on the screen, but it doesn't allow for half-press focus lock - it just focuses and snaps the photo immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now about the camera features. There are three shooting modes: normal shot, burst shot and panorama - nothing fancy here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Burst mode lets you shoot 3, 6 or 9 photos in rapid succession and lets you choose which ones to keep. Choosing this option however forces the device to a lower resolution. It switches to 1280 x 960 pixels for 3- and 6-shots mode and to the lowly 640 x 480 for 9-shots mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama is a bit disappointing too as it only takes three photos in VGA (640x480 pixels) resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the camera settings include the run-of-the-mill white balance, ISO, macro mode, exposure compensation, self-timer, color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an LED to help with darker scenes but it is better suited as an auto-focus assist light. Of course it does photos and videos too, but only at short distances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter sound on our LG Prada 2 unit can't be turned off. We guess if you own an LG Prada, being discreet won't exactly be part of your agenda. Oh, Oscars you say, really?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the performance of the LG Prada 2 camera is average. Five megapixels may sound like much and in fat they are - but only as a quantitative description, not as a qualitative one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you should bear in mind that we have a pre-release unit on our hands and image quality is bound to improve. We don't really expect any R&amp;D department of a reputable manufacturer to release a product without fine tuning the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the moment the fine detail image processing is somehow all wrong and as a result it's details that suffer. The really low contrast and some of the lens imperfections don't help the situation either. Image noise though seems reasonable and colors are captured fairly accurately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera however excels in macro shots but still suffers from the processing issues. There are nice levels of detail and as you can see the text is perfectly readable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Summing it up, we're highly disappointed by the image quality of our reviewing sample of LG Prada 2. Image quality is bound to be fine tuned in the final retail version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, video recording is another a let down with our LG Prada 2 but this time we suppose the same will hold true for the retail version as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the LG KC550, the LG Prada 2 records at the relatively high resolution of 720x480 pixels (the so-called D1).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recording reaches up to 25fps but feels choppy and despite the high resolution it looks really pixelated with even artifacts appearing on occasion - all due to a low bit rate setting. The bit rate is less than half of those of the videos VGA recorded with the LG Renoir and you can really tell the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio is encoded at 8000Hz sample rate with the AMR codec as opposed to Renoir's 16000Hz sample rate and MP3 codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video also have the same aspect ratio problem as LG KC550 and D1 videos produced by the Prada 2 have a 4:3 aspect ratio when watched on a computer instead of the slightly widescreen aspect ratio you would expect from that resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result subjects appear strangely elongated on video. That may sound as a positive feature for some fashion models as it would make them look thinner however it hardly makes us geeks happy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The solution to watch those videos normally is to force the 3:2 aspect ratio from your video player. That however sounds like a potential source of a lot of headaches when sharing videos with other people that are not aware of this peculiarity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But don't take our word for all this, here is a sample D1 video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things don't get much better than that even at VGA resolution, as the bitrate is still rather low. Here you can check a VGA video sample recorded with the Prada 2 as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Varied connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wireless connectivity support is abundant in the LG Prada. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE is on board and so is dual-band HSDPA 7.2 Mbps (900/2100 MHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also supports the two local connectivity standards - Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The Bluetooth version is 2.1 with A2DP support for stereo streaming and 802.11b/g for Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The proprietary universal connectivity port has a lot of jobs to do. You use it to connect the charger, the stereo headset or a USB cable. Speaking of USB, Mass storage mode is also supported so you can use the phone as a portable memory storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite uncommonly for LG, the internal memory gets listed as a second removable drive along with the memory card contents. The Prada 2 can even receive calls normally in this mode - now that's an impressive job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing PIM details is done through the LG PC Suite that comes along on supplied the CD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The provided headset is a two-part one and the remote has a standard 3.5mm jack so you can plug in your favorite pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An optional TV-out cable can also be plugged into the connectivity port as the Prada 2 supports the feature. PAL and NTSC are supported, so it should work on most TV sets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Confusing but overall nice web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The browser is pretty nice, almost identical to the one on the Renoir. It scrolls and pans quite fast. Thanks to the multi-touch implementation on the capacitive touch screen it can do what eludes most other browsers - the legendary "pinch" zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't expect stellar speeds though. It takes quite a while to zoom in and often you end up repeating the gesture because you're not sure you did it right the first time. And when it zooms in too much you have to zoom out which isn't much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls hide automatically after a couple of seconds but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the screen. The accelerometer comes into play when you turn the phone to landscape orientation and the browser rotates very quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A useful feature is that you can have two pages open at the same time as tabs and switch back and forth between them. Saving pages for offline viewing is another thing that you'd probably use quite often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that the browser does easily is search web pages for specific words - it highlights the first match and provides an indication of how many matches there are in total plus arrow keys for switching between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An eye candy enhancement of the plain browsing history list is the option to view it as snapshots of the pages you visited. You can flick between the pages and open the one you are looking for by tapping it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keeping a schedule is an important part of the LG Prada 2 and it has several applications to help you. The Calendar offers monthly and weekly view and you can set which one is the default. Event alarms can be set to go off up to a week earlier so you'd surely have enough time to prepare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature missing from the original Prada that has been added is the ability to choose whether Monday or Sunday is the first day of the week. There's even an option to mark some days as holidays and set the Alarm not to ring on those days. 'Holidays' are not repeated annually so it's more useful to mark your vacation with them rather than national holidays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A To-Do application lets you keep a list of tasks sorted by their importance. If those reminders aren't enough you could always write down a memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KF900 Prada can store up to 500 calendar events, 500 To-Do notes and 100 memos and making a back up on external memory is just a few clicks away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third option in the Organizer menu is the Date Finder. It is useful if you need to know what day of the week will be? let's say? five days from now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm has five slots which you can switch on and off individually and each can be extensively customized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you also get a Calculator with a wide array of functions, a Unit Converter, a World Clock and a Voice recorder. The Voice recorder does not have a limit for the maximum length of a voice note and once you are done recording them you can send them via MMS, email or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games &amp; Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled Picsel viewer handles Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files. Zooming in and out is done by - you guessed it - pinching. Panning once zoomed is a little slow and flicking your finger up or down switches to the previous or next page respectively, which can cause confusion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a useful option to fit the contents in a single column but it only seems to work for doc files. The viewer makes full use of the accelerometer and auto rotates to take advantage of the wide screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled games on the LG Prada 2 are Flying Dices, Wheel Mania and Championship Tour. The first two are the same as the ones in the LG Renoir and are not so much games themselves but tools for playing other games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flying dices lets you roll two dice (by shaking the phone of course) and Wheel Mania spins a wheel to "pick" a random card and suite but it takes forever for the wheel to stop spinning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third game is a golf game that makes some use of the touchscreen but is nothing too fancy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If those aren't enough (and they really aren't if you are the type to play games on a mobile phone), you can install Java MIDP 2.0 games and applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One application you might want but won't find preinstalled on the LG Prada 2 is Opera Mini. These nifty little browser is quite good at what it does and as they have full touch support you would perhaps find them more pleasant to work with at times than the standard built-in web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps you would also be glad to know that unlike the LG Renoir, the LG Prada 2 now allows Java apps to run over the Wi-Fi connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can run several Java applications at once and switch between them and the phone's menu using a simple task manager. There is a virtual on-screen keyboard with a D-Pad but it isn't very comfortable for gaming.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KF900 Prada will try to do everything for you and hey - it will come out right for the most part. To begin with, it's one of the most uncompromising all-inclusive upgrades we've seen in quite a while. The original Prada phone is improved down to the last bit of specs. A fluid and responsive touch interface, 5 MP camera, high-res video recording, lightning fast data transfers and Wi-Fi are a great treat, no doubt about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you bought the first Prada, it was hardly the specs you were after. And it's probably not the performance you'd be keen to upgrade but looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, our problem is not that the design is 2 years old already. The new Prada stays reverently true to the original styling and we guess it tries to connect with the original following. On the other hand, the feature set implies a totally new target audience and it's exactly this inconsistency that questions the LG Prada's success.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all if performance is what you need - the LG KC910 Renoir goes even further and costs much less. Not to mention a few smart messengers that make the new Prada look like a damsel in distress, only without the happy end.</paragraph>
