			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 is one of the headliners in the company's growing Android portfolio. But the Chinese don't just grow droids, they refine them. The Ascend P1 isn't even the best they have, but it sends a clear message that Huawei means business. The big-screened smartphone boasts a 7.7mm thin chassis with enough tech inside to go after some of the big names in the game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P1 is one of the slimmest droids out there and the P1 S version will be a full millimeter thinner. Undoubtedly the 4.3" qHD Super AMOLED screen (as seen on the Motorola RAZR XT910 and the HTC One S) helped achieve the marvelously slim waistline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The computing power comes courtesy of a dual-core 1.5GHz processor and PowerVR SGX540 graphics, which is more than enough to keep the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich OS chugging along smoothly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get quickly acquainted with the Ascend P1 through our lists of features and disadvantages below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera of the Huawei Ascend P1 can shoot 1080p videos but it knows other tricks too and will be stepping on Samsung's and HTC's toes. You get stuff like HDR, burst mode and even group mode, which takes several shots and picks the best expression on each person's face (just like the Scalado-powered solution HTC uses).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, unlike either Samsung or HTC, Huawei offers you stock Android ICS experience, with only a few occasional tweaks. If that's not your cup of tea there's also the 3D home launcher to offer the extra eye candy and usability enhancements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Challenging the establishment is not an easy task, but the Huawei Ascend P1 is ready to make a splash in the upper mid-range. The first step is solid hardware - jump to the next page for the details.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Ascend P1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't get a retail package of the Huawei Ascend P1, so our box only contained a compact charger with a USB port and a microUSB cable. There's also supposed to be a headset and some manuals in here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend P1 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 measures 127.4 x 64.8 x 7.7 mm and weighs 110g, roughly the same as a Samsung Galaxy S II or an HTC One S. It should be noted that the official 7.7mm thickness isn't entirely accurate and, well, ultimately honest. When placed alongside the 8.5mm Galaxy S II you can barely tell the P1 is slimmer, let alone by almost a full millimeter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 has an attractive angular design that stands out and commands respect. Of the several Huawei smartphone we've handled recently, the Ascend P1 is certainly our favorite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a closer look, the all plastic build has its issues. Fingerprints are a serious one to begin with. The front and rear halves of the body fit together perfectly with no visual gaps. The impression is great but quickly spoiled by the gap around the screen, which doesn't look all that great, not to mention that it gathers dust and grime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The beveled sides optically enhance the phone's slimness. The Huawei Ascend P1 has nearly the same surface as the Galaxy S II but being slightly taller, it doesn't appear as wide. It looks sharper and, in a way, more fit. The Ascend P1 also features a similar subtle chin at the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P1 has a 4.3" Super AMOLED screen of qHD resolution. That gives it a pixel density of 256ppi. With the PenTile matrix used, you can see the characteristic crosshatch pattern, but it shouldn't bother most people during regular usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upside, the screen has great contrast, vivid colors and excellent viewing angles. Our measurements show that the screen on the Ascend P1 is as bright as the HTC One X screen and brighter than those of the Galaxy S II and S III droids. You can learn more about the testing process over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is commendable too - our test shows it's slightly better than an iPhone 4S and a bit behind a Samsung Galaxy S II or an HTC One X.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We zoomed into the display using our digital microscope so you can get a better idea of how the pixels are arranged, and how big they are. For comparison, we're including a photo of Galaxy S II's pixels as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Huawei Ascend P1 display matrix ? Samsung Galaxy S II display matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen there's a 1.3MP video call camera (with 720p video recording capabilities), a proximity sensor to disable the screen during calls and an ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display you'll find three capacitive keys for Menu, Home and Back. The phone automatically lights them up in the dark and keeps the backlight off in well-lit conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Huawei Ascend P1 features the Power/Lock key (Samsung users will feel right at home) and below it is the flap covering the microSD card slot. When you open the flap, you'll also notice a small screw holding the back panel in place - we'll get back to that in a minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you'll find a comfortable single-piece volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the Ascend P1 is quite busy - you get a standard 3.5mm audio jack, an MHL-enabled microUSB port and a covered microSIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only item of interest at the bottom is the mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 has an exchangeable rear cover (you'll need to undo that screw, of course). Huawei is selling various back covers if you want to customize your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera and dual-LED flash are positioned near the top, sharing a bulging brushed metal plate. It brings the maximum thickness to just over 10.5mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, we measured the thinnest part of the device and we couldn't find a 7.7mm spot. It's a hair thinner than an 8.5mm-thick Galaxy S II - but certainly not 0.8mm thinner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Off to the side we find the secondary microphone and at the bottom, placed on the chin, is the phone's loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1670 Li-Ion battery under the hood isn't user replaceable. We didn't find any official battery life ratings for the Ascend P1, but we ran our own tests instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, the web browsing performance was pretty poor - just 3 hours and 23 minutes. The talk time over 3G was nothing short of impressive though, clocking in at 12 and a half hours and the video playback time is in the upper end of our charts too, 7 hours and 38 minutes. You can read more about Ascend P1's battery life in our blog post.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our endurance rating worked out to 34 hours - it's kept down by the poor web browsing results. If you use a tablet or a laptop for most of your browsing, you should be able to squeeze out a couple of days of usage from the Huawei Ascend P1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if it's not as thin as Huawei claims, the Ascend P1 is by no means chubby - it's compact and pocketable and rests comfortably in the hand. The protruding camera helps here as you can use it to prop up the phone with your finger, which is great if the back cover doesn't offer much grip (like the Ceramic White one that we had for this review).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build of the phone feels solid; there is no area of the phone that gives way even if you push down on it hard. You should still take care of the phone tough, the rear cover looks scratch-prone and the phone does rest on its camera. The plastic on the back isn't the best we've seen, but it isn't the worst either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Great job by the Huawei team so far, time to look at how proficient they are when it comes to software. The next page starts off with the user interface and how much (or little) of it has been customized.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vanilla and 3D user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 comes with Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box and lets you pick one of the two preinstalled launchers. One offers a virtually stock ICS experience, while the other throws in some extra tweaks and cool 3D effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a user interface demo video to get things started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is fairly busy. At its center is a circle with shortcuts in the four cardinal directions: unlock to the east, camera to the south, messaging to the west and call log to the north.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper area of the lockscreen displays the time and date, but you can swipe to the side to get to the music player controls. At the bottom is a shortcut to the dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is a standard-looking homescreen with five panes (none to be added or deleted). At the bottom you get the familiar shortcut dock (four shortcuts with the app drawer button in the middle) and the Google search bar is fixed to the top of the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the icons come straight from the holo theme that Ice Cream Sandwich brought. Hit the menu key however and you'll notice an option called "Theme settings". This offers two more themes that customize the look of the icons (though not the functionality).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features non-standard toggles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Data and screen rotation. The rest is the same though: a shortcut to the settings and a list of recent events below (you can side-swipe to dismiss them).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is taken directly from ICS - you swipe between horizontally aligned pages and you get two tabs, one for apps and one for widgets. The task switcher is pure ICS too - you get a vertical list of apps that you can discard with a sideways swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far, so good. There's another launcher pre-installed - the 3D home. It's more flexible than the vanilla launcher and lets you have between 5 and 7 homescreen panes. To add or remove some pages, you do a pinch zoom to bring out a familiar aggregate view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D homescreen has a neat trick - 3D widgets. As you swipe between panes you get a nice 3D effect (as if you're rotating a cube) and you can see that some widgets have actual three dimensional shape. That only works for the five 3D widgets though - Calendar, Email, Music+, Photo album and Weather clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer features the same 3D effect when moving between pages, but is otherwise functionally identical. The notification area is untouched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another useful fesature is the Fast boot option - it's similar to HTC's solution and speeds up both shut down and start up times considerably. With this option enabled, the Huawei Ascend P1 will boot in about 6 seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 is powered by a TI OMAP 4460 chipset, featuring two Cortex-A9 cores clocked at 1.5GHz, 1GB of RAM and a PowerVR SGX540 GPU. The screen has qHD resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the P1 has a Power saving option that lets the user balance performance and power consumption. For the benchmarks we set it to the highest performance mode available, but even in the power saving mode the Ascend P1 pretty much matched a Samsung Galaxy S II or the Galaxy Nexus (suggesting that this modes downclocks the CPU to 1.2GHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to performance though, the Huawei Ascend P1 exceeded our expectations - Benchmark Pi times successfully rival those of an HTC One X (with Tegra 3) or the Samsung Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While multithreaded performance is behind quad-core droids or the ones using Snapdragon S4, it's still better than the rest of the Cortex-A9 based dual-cores.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NenaMark 2 shows decent 3D performance and qHD is a good middle ground between resource-hungry 720p and the relatively low WVGA resolution. Almost all 3D games should run at playable framerates. 3D performance isn't affected by enabling the Power saving mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider shows JavaScript performance is somewhere on the level of an iOS6-running iPhone 4S. Even the HTC One X (both the Snapdragon S4 and Tegra 3 versions) doesn't have much lead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For general HTML5 performance, BrowserMark gave the Ascend P1 scores higher than what the HTC's One line got. Actually, the P1 has one of the fastest browsers we've tested - great job, team Huawei.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit that we didn't have very high expectations of the TI OMAP 4460 chipset (we've seen it in action before), but the Huawei Ascend P1 punches above its weight in general performance, though 3D performance is just good - no big wins there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ICS phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many of the native apps on the Huawei Ascend P1 come straight from Ice Cream Sandwich. The phonebook is just our first stop - it's made up of three tabs that you can switch between with sideways swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one in the middle is the default tab, listing all contacts. Contacts are displayed with a name and a picture to the right. They can be sorted by first or last name and displayed with the first or last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and drag to jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's a regular search too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the contact image now brings up a tabbed popup. The tabs are phone and email with a list of the available numbers/addresses. These tabs can be navigated with sideways swipes too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single contact view displays the contacts name along with a star to favorite a contact and a Settings button that lets you edit, share or delete a contact as well assign custom ringtones to them or set the phone to redirect calls from that contact straight to voice mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath is a list of all contact info sorted by category: phone numbers, emails, events, notes and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more contact details. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts that the phonebook displays can be filtered by service (e.g. hide all Facebook contacts) and even filtered by the group they are in or not it (so you can hide all contacts not in a group, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the other two tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is really thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call sound was good and loud and we had no issues with reception. The Huawei Ascend P1 features a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer has the neon-blue on black theme from ICS, but it does have some nice extra functionality - like smart dialing, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer is just the first tab of the phone app, the other two being the Call log and the Favorites tab (the same you get in the Phonebook). In the Call log, you can't delete individual entries, which was mildly annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Ascend P1 through our traditional loudspeaker test and it mananaged an Average score. You can find out more about the test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging covers all bases<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. A cool new feature is that you can mass-delete multiple threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is organized like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the Ascend P1 to delete older messages (by default, it keeps 200 texts and 20 MMS per conversation). You can activate delivery reports, as well as read reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a text is a little frustrating as the text box starts off as a single line and grows up to three lines only, which makes working with longer texts hard. We usually let it slide on previous versions, but with a 4.3" screen there's no excuse not to make the text box bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has grown handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen but is mostly unchanged. It supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool new feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcuts at the bottom of the screen are new email, search, labels, refresh and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard has seen some tweaks and is quite comfortable to type on. You can switch to the default Android keyboard if you prefer, but the Huawei one is bigger, making it easier to type.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and photo, video editors<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Default view of the gallery is Albums, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides Album view you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can manually add).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the thumbnails will tilt to let you know you cannot go further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find a share and a delete button, with a line of small thumbnails underneath of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the menu you can access simple photo edits (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more options. The editor offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider to apply the desired level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app called Movie Studio handles video edits and it's quite feature-rich. You can add multiple videos to the timeline and set their edit points, you can add titles and effects (including transition effects), add music and there are multiple options available when you decide to export the video (resolution, quality, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does 1080p of all kinds<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The the Ascend P1 doesn't have much of a video player - you just open videos from the gallery and that's that. On the up side, it handled most videos we threw at it - all the way up to 1080p, coming from DivX, XviD, MKV and even WMV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't encounter any issues with sound (AC3 and DTS codecs give most phones headaches) and there's Dolby Mobile 3.0+ available to enhance the audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the video player would get buggy every now and then and refuse to play anything. Thank goodness for that quick restart feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality is still very limited - you get play/pause and a slider to scrub through the video but that's it, there isn't even subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the upside, the 4.3" Super AMOLED with qHD resolution is great for watching movies on the go. You can also download a third-party movie player, if you need more functions (like subtitles).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also HD TV-Out available to use the Ascend P1 for a media player at home thanks to the MHL support of the microUSB port.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Dolby<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 comes with an app called Music+ that is an updated version of the stock ICS music app. It uses tabs to organize your music library - there's Playlist, Artists, Albums, Songs, Genres and Folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface features more eye-candy including music visualization and the album art arranged in a Cover flow-like fashion. You can swipe between songs or tap on one of the floating album covers to bring out a list of all songs from that album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the album art is an upwards pointing arrow, which brings out a panel with the song lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music+ app doesn't have an equalizer, but it does feature Dolby Mobile 3.0+. There're no settings to it though, just an On/Off toggle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio lacks RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 has a built-in FM tuner. It can play through the headset or the loudspeaker, but you'll need to have the headset plugged in as it serves as an antenna. We were disappointed not to find RDS - radio stations need to be manually named.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Prety good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 did impressvely well in the active external amplifier part of our test. The smartphone got excellent scores all over the field and had average loudness, so it should do quite well, powering your car audio system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that only one reading takes a serious hit when you plug in a pair of headphones. Granted, the stereo crosstalk spikes to pretty high levels, but the other aspects of the Ascend P1 performance remain great and the volume levels are still decent. A pretty solid overall performance, no matter how you look at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Vision has an 8MP camera for maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. There's a single LED flash to go with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface looks pretty standard - you get a still/video camera toggle, a virtual shutter and a shortcut to the gallery on the right. The fun stuff is on the left side - you get multiple shooting modes (we'll cover those in a second), color effects, face effects (they affect only people's faces) and general settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two other buttons on the viewfinder can toggle the front and rear cameras, and set the flash mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shooting modes include HDR, burst, smile and beauty shot, panorama and low-light. The group mode is pretty impressive - it managed to track up to 25 faces and snap five consecutive shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Afterwards, you can tap on any face and pick which of the five shots the phone should use - so if anyone blinked while you were taking the shot, you can correct it in a second. We guess it's the Scalado technology that powers the camera but Huawei didn't say anything about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the settings menu you can enable things like geotagging, red-eye reduction, rule-of-thirds grid and adjust the image settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers very good levels of fine detail and manages to keep the noise levels low. The colors are oversaturated but pleasing and the exposure is good too. One thing to watch out for is the continuous autofocus - we had several shots (more than usual) which were out of focus. The upper left corner also showed what might be a lens issue with our unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, check out these HDR camera samples and the low-light mode samples below. Keep in mind that you have to have a steady hand for those two to work properly, or you'll get blurry results.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 joins the fight in our Photo Compare Tool. The synthetic resolution chart shows excellent results that can rival the best in the 8MP range. The next chart shows a well-behaved noise-reduction. Finally, the third chart shows good white balance under artificial lighting and very good detail (and some oversaturated colors).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camcorder shoots in 1080p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1's main camera records videos at up to 1080p@30fps, while the secondary camera is good for up to 720p@30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is practically identical to that of the still camera. You lose the color effects option, but you can still enable the face effects if you're up for some goofy videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot in MP4 files with a high bitrate (about 20Mbps for 1080p videos and 13Mbps for 720p videos). The videos are recorded with stereo sound and hit the 30fps mark without a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have plenty of fine detail, but there's noticeable fringing around objects which isn't present in still shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the 1080p and 720p video samples we've uploaded to YouTube. Don't forget to choose 1080p and 720p respectively and view them in full screen:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download these untouched 1080p@30fps (0:08s, 20.4MB) and 720p@30fps (0:09s, 14.2MB) samples, taken straight off the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 qualifies for the 1080p competition that's going on in our Video Compare Tool. Let's start with the third chart - it very clearly shows the color fringing we saw earlier. This suggests that the optics are low-quality, but the effect is fixed in post-processing for still shots, but there isn't enough time to do it 30 times a second for the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, that effect isn't that noticeable in real-life scenes and they end up looking quite okay. Even in low light the videos are good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Solid connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 comes with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE and penta-band 3G, meaning you'll be able to use it pretty much anywhere in the world. The 3G is enhanced with HSDPA and HSUPA but we couldn't find official speed ratings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA, so you can easily play media (photos, videos, music) from DLNA-enabled storage devices or push content from your phone to a DLNA TV or music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 3.0 is also available if you need to transfer non-multimedia files between devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port on the Huawei Ascend P1 is MHL-enabled, which means that with a supported dongle you can hook up the phone to an HDTV and make good use of that capable video player.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P1 comes with the excellent Ice Cream Sandwich web browser, which is both blazing fast and highly functional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser chrome is quite minimalistic - you get the URL bar with a tabs shortcut and that's it. Hitting the menu key reveals the rest of the controls - everything from searching on the page, saving to bookmarks to useful options like bypassing mobile sites, saving a page for offline reading and sharing a page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search provider to be Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tab switching is handled in a similar way to switching between apps. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Inverted screen rendering option, which turns the web page black and white (with white backgrounds becoming black). You can tweak this effect using the Contrast slider. This option is under the Accessibility menu and makes pages easier to read (plus the black on white looks awesome on the Super AMOLED screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser has Incognito mode (there's no global setting, but you can open Incognito tabs). The other thing the browser does is preload search results when it's confident you'll click on them. These are two tricks borrowed from Google's desktop browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our favorite Quick controls are available from the Labs settings, which reveal three controls (Tabs, URL, More) when you tap anywhere on the edge of the screen. Quick controls use a radial menu, so it's very natural and comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser works very fast and smooth and had no issues with website compatibility. Flash also worked just fine with YouTube 1080p videos and Flash games running smoothly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer apps and office document editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 comes with Polaris Office, which handles document editing with ease. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs (both the 2003 and 2007 versions), it opens PDF files and it doubles as a file explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a document, you get plenty of options - from text size and formatting to text justification, lists, tables, an Excel formula editor and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a proper file explorer too - it has three tabs, the first of which organizes files by type (e.g. audio, video, documents and so on), while the other two handle the internal and external storage organized by folders. The app can do all basic stuff that's expected of a file explorer, but it also opens and creates ZIP files. It supports batch operations too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar features four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar. You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A very useful app is Security guard. One of its features is blacklist - you can add phone numbers to that list (from the phonebook, call log or the list of received messages) and calls and texts from that number will be blocked. There's a white list too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other features of the Security guard include encrypting and decrypting files and storing your passwords. Be warned that encrypted files are stored into a proprietary .HWE format and might not be compatible with other tools.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app defaults to a desk clock mode that looks a lot like the lockscreen and you can turn the light almost all the way down to enter a power-efficient mode with a single tap. The usual alarm functionality is there - you can set multiple alarms, each with its own repeat time, ringtone and label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a basic Notes app and a Sound recorder. There's a Weather clock app too, which offers weather info for multiple cities complete with beautiful animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big, easily thumbable keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the flashlight app. The interface is essentially a 3D rendition of a flashlight and it lights up the LED flash at one of three power levels.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P1 features a built-in GPS receiver that takes a couple of minutes to get a lock. You can use A-GPS to speed that up or go for Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning for a rough lock (all three options however require an Internet connection).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is onboard and offers the same functionality but with some changes to its interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top band features a dropdown that makes it easy to switch between several different modes - Maps, Places, Navigation, Check in, Latitude, Location history and My places. The bottom bar uses shortcuts for searching, planning a route, searching near you, selecting which layers are visible and getting into the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app uses very data-efficient vector maps, which have the added bonus of letting you control the viewing point with two fingers (pinching for zooming, rotating for turning the camera and sliding for tilt control). 3D buildings are also available in some regions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street view and Search nearby are available as always.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use Maps to plan pedestrian and car routes or routes with public transport. Some regions get to use Google Maps Navigation that does voice-guided navigation. It needs a data connection when you first create the route, but after that you can go offline (it will even recalculate the route if you go off course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has announced that they will be releasing an update that will fully enable offline operation too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Google Play Store and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When we first got the Huawei Ascend P1 at the office we thought it was a great phone - if only had it arrived a year earlier. Now that we're done reviewing it, we think it's an excellent package for this year too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clearly, the Ascend P1 won't beat any of the new flagship releases by the major players, but there's a good chance it will do well in the high volume upper midrange market. It has a solid build quality, very good performance and a software experience that Android purists will appreciate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're quite happy with the Super AMOLED screen too - its PenTile matrix is something that's annoying only when you know it's there and look from way too close, while everything else about its performance is great. The camera does quite well too, especially the Group shot mode, which mimics the functionality of the HTC One series.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that's great, but the Ascend P1 still faces an uphill battle - Huawei isn't exactly a household name and the yesteryear flagships are now priced very competitively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The highly popular Samsung Galaxy S II (at least for now) costs less than the P1. It has a non-PenTile (but lower-res) Super AMOLED screen, an excellent camera and things like optional NFC, USB On The Go, about the same thickness and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR XT910 uses the same screen as the Ascend P1, on top of being thinner and finished in Kevlar. Although it cannot match the speed of the Huawei, it's much cheaper. A Motorola RAZR MAXX is pricier and thicker, but offers mind-blowing battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you're going to live with a PenTile Super AMOLED, you might as well make it the 720p screen of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus. The Nexus has some Google-imposed limitations though (no microSD or mass storage mode, etc.), but the promise of timely Android updates and vanilla experience will appeal to the same Android purists who might have been interested in the Ascend P1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II &#x2022; Motorola RAZR XT910 &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy Nexus</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 12MP Sony Xperia S is also worth a look. A 720p screen, dual-core CPU, NFC, standard microHDMI, USB On The Go and plenty of (non-expandable) built-in storage are nice things to have. Android 2.3 Gingerbread less so, but the update is coming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An HTC Sensation XE is an interesting option too - those iBeats headset are hard to say 'no' to. If you can stomach the price difference (it's not that big), the HTC One S is one of the best droids on the market right now, with a faster processor, slimmer aluminum unibody and the same qHD Super AMOLED display as the Huawei phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Xperia S &#x2022; HTC Sensation XE &#x2022; HTC One S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, the Huawei Ascend P1 is a great, well-rounded upper mid-range droid that holds its own against the competition. Huawei may have to slash the price for it to really gain traction - people are not willing to pay the same (or more) for a relatively unknown maker when they can go with a big-name brand. And who knows, there may be a point in their long-term strategy, where Huawei become a part of the very establishment they're now challenging.</paragraph>
