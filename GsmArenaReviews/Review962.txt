			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having cornered the Android smartphone market, Samsung now has smart cameras in its sights. The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom is a crossover of an Android phone and a point-and-shoot camera, trying to put the best of both worlds in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a lot more compact than last year's Galaxy Camera and this year's Galaxy NX and, unlike both of them, it has full telephony features. So, it has the makings of a midrange Android smartphone but adds a big sensor, xenon flash, Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) and 10x zoom. These things are usually well out of the reach of a smartphone, which needs to be thin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thin the Galaxy S4 zoom isn't, but it's got other virtues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's like a Galaxy S4 mini and a point-and-shoot camera had a teleportation accident and merged together. Of course, the chipset is a bit older than what the mini has, but still benchmarks well enough. The Zoom even kept the IR blaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It used to be that people took a few dozen photos a year. Now they will do the same in a day or two and share them with the world in an instant. And all that thanks to the ever-improving photography skills of phones. The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom takes this trend to an extreme - its long zoom, OIS and capable flash keep it relevant where a phone would be all but useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Combining two gadgets in one has its advantages - you only have to carry one device. You're buying only one device too. But just how good is the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom at being both a phone and a camera? Read on and find out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Galaxy S4 zoom<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom came in Samsung's new boxes made out of recycled materials (and they are recyclable once you're done with them). The contents are fairly standard: a compact charger and a microUSB cable to go with it, a one-piece headset (in-ear headphones, three button remote), some spare tips for the headset and manuals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom measures 125.5 x 63.5 x 15.4mm, the same height and width as the S4 mini, but thicker. Obviously. The actual number doesn't tell the whole story as the device itself isn't all that thick, save for two key areas - the lens and the grip. The first is out of necessity (you can make a 10x lens only so thin) and the other's for the sake of ergonomics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom has two faces - that of an S4 mini on the front and a Samsung camera on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design of the S4 zoom is fundamentally the same as the Galaxy Camera's, tough Samsung has moved some things around. If you ignore the back for a second, the device is almost identical to the mini, except the volume rocker is now on the right side. This allows you to use the Zoom in the same way you would the S4 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For snapping photos, the grip offers a good hold of the device and you can shoot one handed without worrying you'll drop it. Samsung's favorite hyperglazed plastic is rather slippery which isn't ideal but isn't a deal breaker either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arrangement of the controls is fairly comfortable, whether you use the Galaxy S4 zoom as a phone or as a camera. Not in equal amounts though - holding it horizontally by the grip is a lot better than holding it vertically with the camera lens pressing against your palm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed something odd - there's a piece of glass (or clear plastic) on the front of the lens, over the mechanical lens cover. That means you can't rely on the cover for protection from smudges and the glass can get scratched too. We hope this is some sort of reinforced glass that will be durable enough to survive in the long run though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, to further emphasize the camera-centric nature of the device, there's a tripod mounting hole at the bottom. There's a small stopper plugging it when not in use, but since it's not attached to the camera you should be careful not to lose it. This can be used in situations when you need a steady shot (e.g. time lapse videos). The Optical Image Stabilization is usually good enough for a handheld night shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom is quite thick and heavy compared to a modern smartphone, but still pocketable, unless you're wearing tight jeans. You might want to consider using the lanyard eyelet instead and carry the device like a regular camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom packs a 4.3" Super AMOLED screen picked up from the S4 mini parts bin. It has qHD resolution (540 x 960) and 256ppi. That's not enough to challenge higher-end devices like the Galaxy S4 or the Galaxy Camera, but reasonable in the midrange. And it's not a PenTile, but instead uses the arrangement that debuted with the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom display under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Super AMOLED renders highly saturated colors (if you're a fan of that) and has great colors and viewing angles. It isn't particularly bright though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is important for a camera with no viewfinder as you have to rely on the screen and you'll probably be taking a lot of photos with the sun to your back. The Galaxy S4 zoom does very solidly here, bring only slightly more reflective than the best performing Samsung AMOLED screens. There are going to be very few cases when the S4 zoom display is hard to see in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display doesn't use a PenTile matrix, instead it uses the arrangement that debuted with the Galaxy Note II with three subpixels for each pixel, but the Blue one has a different shape. Anyway, the sharpness isn't on the level of 400+ ppi flagships and you can notice occasional jaggies and color halos around fine, high-contrast detail like text, but you won't see it in photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While 4.3" of diagonal and qHD resolution are in the midrange as far as smartphones are concerned, the display is actually pretty high-end for a point-and-shoot camera. Most cameras you'll find have 3-or-so inch screens (even the touchscreen models) and far lower resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls, ports and slots<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the Galaxy S4 zoom is a direct copy of the S4 mini - there are the front-facing camera, proximity and ambient light sensors around the earpiece and the hardware Home and capacitive Back and Menu keys below the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we liked (even if it took a little getting used to) is that the camera app disables the capacitive buttons. Those are too easy to press accidentally when you hold the zoom in one hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone (top if you look at it as a camera) holds the Power/Lock key, volume rocker and the shutter key. The Power/Lock key and volume rocker are fairly thin and not the most comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware shutter key is another matter though, it's fairly comfortable even though it would have been slightly better to use if it was slightly further to the left. It can be half-pressed to focus and will launch the camera app if you hold it (but it doesn't automatically unlock the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the Galaxy Camera there was a zoom lever around the shutter key, but is missing here. Instead, you can use the control ring around the lens to zoom in and out (or use the volume rocker as on a regular phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ring has a ridged exterior for extra grip, but rotates smoothly (there are no distinct steps). At the moment, the ring only controls the zoom, but we hope Samsung adds an option to control things like aperture, shutter speed and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the ring has an advantage over the zoom lever, it's much easier to get a specific zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the lens is the xenon flash and LED light. The flash is always available, you don't have to manually extend and retract it like on the Galaxy Camera. On the other side of the lens is the loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom (left in camera orientation) holds the 3.5mm audio jack, secondary microphone and the IR blaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the bottom (right) is the primary mic and the MHL-enabled microUSB port. The USB port is actually at the edge of a plastic flap that covers the battery and microSIM card slot. The battery compartment was borrowed from digital cameras and features a lock that holds the battery in place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery has 2,330mAh capacity, a bit more than the Galaxy S4 mini got and not bad for a point-and shoot camera. Keep in mind that most such cameras don't have active radios, which can drain the battery pretty quick. Note that the unit Samsung sent us (a retail unit according to company) had a battery labeled "2,130mAh", but the official specs of the Galaxy S4 zoom say 2,330mAh battery capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom scored a respectable endurance rating of 61 hours over the 54 hours of the S4 mini. The talk time was pretty good at 15 and a half hours, but the web browsing and video playback were both lower than the mini's times (by one and four hours respectively). You can read more details about the Galaxy S4 zoom battery performance at our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSIM card slot can easily be accessed without having to remove the battery, which is great if you need to swap out the card (the Galaxy S4 zoom will probably not be your primary device and you won't keep a SIM in it at all times).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port handles charging, data connectivity and TV Out duties and can be used with the flap open or closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, the left side of the phone (bottom for the camera) offers a microSD card slot, tripod mounting hole and the lanyard eyelet. The microSD card slot is covered by a plastic flap and the card is easily hot-swappable. You'll probably need a card in there as the S4 zoom comes with only 4GB of built-in storage and there's less than 3GB available to the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom, we also received a case for the device. It consists of a rubbery strip that encircles the phone and has buttons for all the controls. It keeps the microUSB port exposed, so you can charge the zoom and download photos without having to remove the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The case probably won't protect the device against drops, but at least the screen will be safer under the flap. The flap has a groove about a third of the way from the side so you can flip it slightly open to take a peak and close it. It's an active cover too, so the screen wakes automatically when you do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a hole for the earpiece so you can talk with the flap closed, but there's no window that shows a part of the screen with the time and notifications.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz is for cameras too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom comes with the same software as most recent Samsung smartphones and even the Galaxy NX. This means the latest Android, 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, and a laundry list of new TouchWiz features. The Galaxy S4 family has quite a lot of exclusive stuff to boast about and while it seems familiar, there's plenty new below the surface - so much in fact that you'd need a couple of days to just get acquainted with all the features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a user interface video to start you off, which also includes a close look at the camera and its rich features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the lockscreen, which has the new widgets introduced with Android 4.2, though Samsung fiddled with them a bit. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message. You have to enable an option in the Settings to get all the widgets, and while you're at it you can also enable the beautiful random wallpapers from TripAdvisor (with text at the bottom about where the photo was taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The water ripples have been replaced by a lens flare effect though, if you prefer, you can switch back to the old one or disable it altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, once you enable that option the lockscreen offers multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut to the camera (as in pure Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - email, Google Now, WatchON, Messaging, music player, Yahoo! Finance and News and you can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no app shortcuts at the bottom of the screen by default - the Favorite Apps widget to the right has taken over that role, but you can enable them and have up to five easily accessible shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the greeting on the lockscreen by hitting the edit button. You can type something else, choose a different font and color. You can also disable the personal message altogether and remove the time and date info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might want to disable the lockscreen altogether to make launching the camera faster. Unfortunately, we found that the hardware shutter key doesn't launch the camera when the Galaxy S4 zoom is locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the screen there are five (or eight in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. You can swipe horizontally to get to the others or you can tap the new button that reveals a grid of more shortcuts, 10 in total. A two finger swipe works too. You can rearrange this grid (the top row toggles are always visible).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panel doesn't show all toggles - you get up to 10 visible, plus 6 more hidden ones, which you can bring up (replacing one of the 10 visible ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can disable this slider to get more room for notifications. The Auto toggle automatically adjusts the brightness but you can use the slider to tweak that, depending on whether you want a darker or brighter display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notifications themselves have not changed - they can be expanded to reveal more info and collapsed to save space, or dismissed with a sideways swipe. Sometimes they also have helpful buttons on them like "Call back" and "Send SMS" on a missed call notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks mostly the same. Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub, S Travel, etc. There's a wraparound feature, which lets you scroll homescreens infinitely by always going from the last to the first one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into the overview mode of all homescreen panes. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here. One pane is marked as "home", that's the one you go back to when you press the Home button, you can choose a different homescreen as the default quite easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer hasn't changed really since the early days of Nature UX. The app shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide shortcuts (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also maximize space in the app drawer by stacking apps into folders. You can either drag icons on top of each other in edit mode or you can check multiple apps via the create folder option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before widgets are in a separate tab in the drawer (this is what stock Android dictates).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch to zoom in the app drawer works in a similar way to the homescreen - it gives you an overview of all panes as thumbnails which you can rearrange (but not delete). There's a dedicated downloaded pane too, where all your downloaded apps go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you drag out shortcuts and widgets to the homescreen you get a list of small thumbnails of all the homescreen panes with the silhouettes of the widgets there so you can judge how much space is available on each pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App switcher interface is unchanged - there's a list of thumbnails of all the recent apps (apps can be swiped to dismiss) and three buttons at the bottom, Task manager, Google Now and Kill all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu has been redone in the latest TouchWiz version. Instead of a scrollable grid of icons and sections Samsung has went with a tabbed interface. On top you get four tabs - Connection, My device, Accounts and More. You can find the related features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the My device tab, while Wi-Fi settings are in Connection).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It makes navigating the settings menu much faster and more intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like what Samsung has done with the latest iteration of TouchWiz. Despite pilling feature upon feature, the whole thing really feels intuitive and well organized. There's still a learning curve, but it mostly involves users finding out they can tweak TouchWiz to their liking or getting to know all the functionality they get out of the box (where other phones would need third-party apps).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Motion gestures and Smart Screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom comes with several advanced TouchWiz-exclusive features, though not as many as a regular S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Smart Display features, Smart Stay and Smart Rotate, are enabled too. Stay prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face (great for reading) and Rotate uses the orientation of your face rather than accelerometer feedback to decide how to rotate the screen (the accelerometer gets this wrong if you're lying on your side).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's older motion gestures are here too. There's direct call (dial the contact whose details you're currently viewing by lifting the phone up to your face), smart alert (makes the phone vibrate when you pick it up if there are missed events), zooming and panning in the gallery, a shake of the phone to refresh the list of Bluetooth devices and muting alarms or pausing music playback by putting the phone face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pause the music player by putting your palm over the screen. A palm swipe takes a screenshot (but so does holding down the Home and Power buttons, which we find easier).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>S Voice is Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri and is preloaded on the Galaxy S4 zoom. S Voice can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual phone and it has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy S4 zoom to answer a call, snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The problem with S Voice is not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, being a Jelly Bean smartphone, the S4 Active also comes with Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow, and offers the weather forecast for your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own separate widget for the homescreen or lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom packs a relatively old chipset, an Exynos 4212, which is more or less what the Galaxy S II had except that the newer part is built on a slightly better process and has 1.5GB of RAM. Other than that you get two Cortex-A9 cores clocked at 1.5GHz (this is where the new process kicks in) and a Mali-400 GPU. We're not expecting miracles on the CPU front, but the GPU should be good enough for the qHD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-threaded performance is no match for new Krait cores, but some phones (like the Nexus 4) still struggle with performance. Multi-threaded performance is not great, as can be expected out of two relatively slow cores.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The system-wide benchmarks AnTuTu and Quadrant put the Galaxy S4 zoom near the bottom, though its Quadrant score is pretty close to the Galaxy S III. It's a relatively old benchmark, the newer AnTuTu sees a bigger (but still not 2x) performance gap between the two.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>GLBenchmark 2.5 and 2.7 were run in 1080p offscreen mode - four times the physical resolution of the screen. If nothing else, this test shows the S4 zoom packs about as much GPU power as the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Epic Citadel, which runs at screen resolution, shows that the GPU is quite enough for qHD gaming. The 56+ fps result means that framerate rarely dips below 60fps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is top notch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on the Galaxy S4 zoom packs an incredibly wide range of features. Four tabs on top provide access to the Phone app, Groups, Contacts and Favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there are various options to filter contacts by phone numbers, groups and multiple sorting. You can import/export contacts to/from the SIM card but you can't display them alongside the phone memory entries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A call or a message to someone can be triggered directly from the contact list with a right and left swipes respectively, which is really handy on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contacts feature, upon a tap on the contact picture, shows a pop up menu with shortcuts to call, text, email or Google Talk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on a contact reveals all the details available. Information is perfectly organized into different sections for phone, email, etc. You can use the back button to go to the full contact list, or tap in the top left corner, just like in vanilla Android. The top right corner has shortcuts to contact editing and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the phone book finds duplicate contact entries, it'll prompt you to join them. Furthermore, there are a plethora of options once you hit the Menu button. You can view the call history, as well as join, unjoin and share contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's plenty of contact information you can assign to each contact and it still remains neatly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc.) and, just like the previous version of TouchWiz, there's a plus sign on the right - tapping it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reject list blocks certain numbers from calling you, even just prefixes (e.g. block foreign calls). It works great with preset numbers and you can also bar unknown numbers. There are third party blacklist apps in the Play Store but it's nice to have this out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a specific vibration pattern as an incoming call alert, just like you would a ringtone. A set of predefined patterns is offered, but you can make your own too. You can also assign a custom vibration to specific contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the Galaxy S4 zoom is really something. It's almost too advanced for some users but its interfaces is simple enough so you can only use the features you need. Once you find your feet around you will appreciate having cool extras like call barring, which stock and most other forms of Android lack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with all the bells and whistles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom offers top notch quality and managed to hold onto reception with ease. Earpiece volume is great and Samsung has even gone as far as adding an in-call equalizer, which does wonders if you want an even louder experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone app on the Galaxy S4 zoom features Smart Dial, which searches names and numbers simultaneously. Only one contact is shown (with contact photo) and you can tap the down arrow to view the rest (the number above the arrow indicates how many contacts have matched your query).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Direct Call is here too and lets you dial a number by lifting the phone up to your ear while browsing contacts or reading/composing a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available too and taken care of by the newly added S Voice, which activates on a double tap of the home button. All you need to say is "Hi Galaxy" and speak your command (e.g. "call Dexter"). It takes a while to process voice commands but it has more uses than other voice-recognition apps for Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off when you hold it next to your ear during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer also offers quick shortcuts for making a video call or sending a message instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom scored a Good mark. You can find more about the testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging with room for customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: a list of all your messages organized into threads with a Compose message button in the top right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a right swipe starts a call, while a left swipe starts a new message (a little redundant, but it's good if you have the habit of swiping left).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding any multimedia content to the message automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom packs Samsung's standard on-screen QWERYT keyboard, which features a Swipe-like mode that tracks your finger and guesses the word you're trying to type. This feature works great but has limited language support for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use voice dictation to input text - since this is a Jelly Bean phone you can do it even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has left a lot of room for customizing your messaging experience. You can choose from different bubbles and background and can use the volume button to increase or decrease the font in conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However you don't get the option to choose your own colors for either the conversation bubble which we would've liked to see. The background can be changed according to your taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're composing a new message you can use the Translate option to translate it into another language. The same goes for messages you've received. This feature probably won't see much use but it's there you ever need it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What will come in good use, however, is the new Direct call (again) feature. When you are reading a message from someone, their number will be automatically dialed by just lifting the phone up to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the dialer, the Messaging app has built-in spam prevention. You can block some numbers (or all unknown numbers) and even add specific phrases to be blocked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has grown handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen but is mostly unchanged. It supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox. Swiping on a specific message will archive it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Email app can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items. You can mark people as priority senders (they also get a custom notification sound) and make the Priority inbox the first folder you see when you launch the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper-left corner you'll find a context menu prompt, which lists all your folders. It's also accessible through a swipe from the side so you'll need to tap the mail icon each time you want to gain access to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the SMS app, the Email app has built-in spam and translate options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk was replaced with the new Hangouts app. It handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network used to be compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts, but Google is moving to close it off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery, video editor and other photo apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the S4 zoom is the standard TouchWiz Gallery, which is very capable. It has several view modes - Albums (the basic one), but also Time, Locations, People and Favorites, which help you sort through your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size of the thumbnails can be adjusted with a pinch zoom or with the lens ring. The lens ring can also be used to zoom in on photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe right to reveal a pane with all the folders, which helps navigate multiple folders with photos (you can pick multiple photos from multiple folders at once). One option advanced photographers will appreciate is the picture details popup, which shows things like focal length, ISO, aperture, shutter speed and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gallery will automatically pull photos from your Picasa account (now folded into Google+).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also offers two ways to annotate your photos. One turns the photo into a virtual Polaroid and lets you write a note on the empty space. The other is non-destructive and saves the scribbled label away from the photo, but those are harder to share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Story Album can be really helpful in organizing your photos. After a shooting session it will prompt you to group all the new photos into an album. Albums can be created based on location, the people in the photo and when the shot was taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom also includes Photo Suggest, which gives you a peek at the most popular locations and sights people have photographed either near you or in places you plan on visiting. This way you can plan ahead what to see and photograph.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app offers a fairly capable image editor. It covers the basic operations like crop and rotate, adjust image properties (from Auto adjust to manual exposure tweaking), add color effects and frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A more creative app is the Paper Artist - it applies an effect to the photo and lets you paint only a section of the image to highlight a specific objects. You can also draw freehand and add frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing videos is also enabled and it's a very simple process. You pick a theme (you get only one preinstalled, the rest you can download for free), which puts in a few stock clips for titles and lets you plug in your own videos and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The My Files app hasn't changed really - it is an efficient and simple to use file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>One of the best music players on a camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy S4 zoom is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC (16 bit, not 24 bit), Wave, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album, Playlist, etc. but there's also Folder support, which is quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on so many other players. There are more tabs available - you can hide or show tabs from the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom can also search for content on third party players like PCs on the same network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one with 7 bands) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players. There's also Smart Volume, which equalizes the volume between tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options - a timescroll of the song, play/pause and back/forth controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen. Voice commands can be used to control the player too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Awesome video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The best video player found on smartphones just got better. The new video player, found on the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom has the last watched video on top for quick access. Under it there are three tabs - personal (showing you the videos on your local storage), Download (which lets into the Videos store) and Nearby devices, which shows the PCs and players on your local Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is our favorite as it is a true quad-core tour de force - the visible video thumbnails are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate and generating those previews takes a couple of minutes the first time around, but it's an awesome preview and it shows what can be done when you have processing power to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too. The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the large, high-res screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chapter preview detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is here too - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom managed to play all files we threw at it. DivX and XviD along with MP4, AVI and MKV were no problem for the Galaxy S4 Active, though DTS and AC3 audio failed play.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nicely smooth audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite the different chipset, the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom didn't disappoint and matched the perfectly clean audio output of the rest of the Galaxy S4 family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom had absolutely flawless output when connected to an active external amplifier, producing excellent scores all over the field. Its volume levels aren't the highest we have seen, but it should just fine for most users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressively enough, there's next to no degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. Save for the barely detectable (in the lab, let alone with a naked ear) hike in stereo crosstalk the output remains perfect. A really solid showing by the hybrid device here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera interface and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom features a 1/2.3" 16MP image sensor and an optically stabilized 10x zoom lens. It's more or less what you can expect in a midrange point-and-shoot, but quite impressive for a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the latest generation of what debuted on the Galaxy Camera and was later adapted by the Galaxy S4. It offers a host of features, for both casual and advanced users, and navigates carefully between them so it doesn't confuse newcomers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera starts in automatic mode by default, but you can make it start in the last used mode instead. The right column of the viewfinder displays the battery charge, the virtual still and video camera shutters and the mode selection button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the top left is the back/front-facing camera toggle plus some essential indicators like flash mode. The right arrow brings out additional settings, the selection can be customized. At the bottom you get the gallery shortcut with a thumbnail of the last photo taken, along with an up arrow that brings out a selection of color effects with live preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom lives up to its name with 10x optical zoom. You can control it either with the lens ring or with the onscreen + and - buttons. Here's just how close to your subject you can get using the zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's what that looks like in full resolution:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) is turned on in Auto mode, in fact there's no option to disable it. If you go to one of the more advanced modes a button will appear in the settings menu, but we recommend keeping it on as it removes hand shake. OIS works for both the still and video camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mode selection button is the gateway to most of the functionality of the S4 zoom camera - single taps will switch between Auto, Smart, Expert and My mode, while a press and hold brings out the settings for the current mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart mode is like the one you get on the Galaxy S4, but with many more options. There's burst shot, Best face, HDR, Macro, Panorama, Eraser (lets you remove moving objects), Sound &amp; shot (records ambient sound with the photo, but is hard to share), Drama shot (creates a composite of multiple photos), Animated photo (creates an animated GIF) and so on and so forth. There are also specific modes like Baby and Food.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These modes can be selected from a grid or from a carousel. The grid is quicker, but the carousel offers descriptive text, which is a good way to learn what each mode does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart suggest is a new addition to the interface. It automatically picks the three options it thinks are most appropriate for the current scene and leaves the final choice to you. For example, if it's dark it will suggest Night mode or Fireworks, if it sees you're focusing from a close distance it will offer Macro, for landscape shots it will suggest Landscape and Panorama and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Auto mode, the S4 zoom will also try to guess the best setting. An icon in the top right corner shows its guess and in case it's wrong, you can always go to Smart mode and pick manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Expert mode is geared toward more experienced photographers that can choose the appropriate aperture, shutter speed and ISO for the shot on their own. The interface presents these options as lens control rings on the display, but you can't use the actual lens ring for any of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the aperture you get two options, which depend on the zoom level - at 1x it's either F3.1 or F8.8 and at 10x zoom it's between F6.3 and F17.8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selected major settings (shutter speed, aperture, exposure and ISO) are displayed at the top of the screen where they are easily visible. You can tap on one of them (if it's available in the current mode) and adjust it. Also, these settings show up in Smart mode too and while you can't modify them (they are selected automatically), you can make note of them if you're learning what settings work best in a situation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tweak a lot more - sharpness, EV, metering, drive (for automatic exposure bracketing) and so on. You can choose between Manual, Program and Custom modes on Expert depending on how much control you want over the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don't get intimidated by all this camera lingo, the Info button is always available to give you a brief description of what each feature does. Plus, each individual setting brings up its own info popup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's My Mode, which lets you star up to five options from both Smart and Expert modes, so you don't have to dig through the long menus, and save time for frequently used modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings menu of the camera reveals yet more functionality. One particularly interesting option is Remote Viewfinder - you install the app on a smartphone and the Galaxy S4 zoom will beam the viewfinder image and camera controls over Wi-Fi (the S4 zoom turns into a Wi-Fi hotspot for the pairing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other sharing options include Samsung's proprietary Share shot, Buddy photo share and ChatON photo share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there are options for the AF/shutter sound volume, rule-of-thirds gridlines, viewfinder brightness (independent from the global screen setting), AF light (turns on the LED light to focus in the dark) and GPS tag and Contextual file name (it uses the GPS to detect where you are, the file name will include the name of the place, down to the name of the street, where applicable).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lens ring is useful even outside the camera - if you rotate it, the S4 zoom displays a quick launcher that gets you directly into one of several pre-selected modes - Auto, Beauty face, Landscape, Macro, Animated photo and Night, or you can launch the gallery. You just rotate the lens ring to the desired mode and wait a second. If you take several seconds to pick the camera won't launch automatically, you have to tap the shutter key once you finally make a decision.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 1/2.3" sensor of the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom is bigger than what most smartphones have and the 16MP resolution isn't that much higher than current 13MP shooters, which means per-pixel image quality should be better. The higher-quality optics should help a lot too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos do indeed have a good amount of fine detail, despite having a wide-angle lens (24mm in 35mm equivalent). Phones like the Galaxy S4 have narrower lenses, which helps them pack more fine detail but fit less of the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, despite the relatively big sensor, the S4 zoom's photos have some noise in them, which inevitably leads to loss of fine detail due to the noise reduction. At the wide end of the lens, there's some corner softness (which is par for the course when it comes to point-and-shoot cameras).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are noticeable oversharpening halos too. On the up side, colors are accurate and the dynamic range is fairly good. If you're shooting against the sun, you can use the HDR mode to boost it even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S4 zoom can shoot panoramas and does a pretty good job of the stitching with only minor artifacts, but we were very disappointed by the resolution, which is under 500px vertically. You can get it up to about 900px if you hold the phone vertically, but then the panorama doesn't cover 360. The Galaxy S4, in comparison, can churn out impressive 60MP panoramas.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom can go head to head in our Photo compare tool with its bigger siblings - last year's Galaxy Camera and this year's Galaxy NX - plus a wide range of phones we've tested. Don't forget that you can use the scaling option to eliminate the difference in resolution.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom can record 1080p videos at the standard 30fps or you can go to 60fps at 720p, which offers fluid motion for action-packed scenes. This mode is quite rare on phones, but can really make a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera can push the framerate even further and do 120fps slow-mo videos (but resolution drops to 768 x 512).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use touch focus and zoom during video recording and snap stills too. Here's a video that goes from 1x zoom to 10x and back. Keep in mind that without optical image stabilization videos can be quite shaky even without zoom, with 10x zoom it would be a mess. The Galaxy S4 zoom, however, manages to keep the shot steady even as we pan around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera shares the still camera interface, but there are a few options specific to the camcorder. One is to enable Quiet zoom during video recording, so you can zoom without noise from the mechanism being captured in the recording, and Windcut, which tries to reduce noise in windy situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a 1080p sample recoded with the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>During video recording you can also snap stills, but they come out with 4MP resolution (4:3 aspect ratio). Here's one:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All the latest connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom starts off with the basics - quad-band GSM<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G. An LTE-variant of the device will also be available for supported regions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's latest Android flagship uses Bluetooth 4.0 alongside Wi-Fi support which includes a/b/g/n, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom allows you to share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the S4 and other later-generation S devices back-to-back. You can share with other NFC devices as well, but functionality is limited to what is provided by the stock Android Beam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AllShare DLNA functionality, which used to be a standalone application, is now more thoroughly integrated into the respective Samsung applications. To share or access content from nearby DLNA-enabled devices, you do this directly from the My Video app and the Music Player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an IR-port, which allows you to control various TV's and other devices using Samsung's WatchON app, which we'll cover below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL 2.0 port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL 2.0 port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. There isn't one included in the retail box and those can be hard to come by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you plug the dongle into the phone you also need to plug a charger into the additional microUSB port on the dongle and the Galaxy S4 zoom screen will be mirrored on the TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MHL 2.0 port has yet another feature - it features USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (there isn't one in the box) but this one is fairly straightforward - you plug it into the Galaxy S4 Active and plug a standard USB cable on the other end.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Polished web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom comes the stock Android browser, which is fast, optimized and packs a good deal of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both multiple double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page, request desktop site and so on. It even has its own separate brightness slider with an Automatic brightness toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Quick settings are missing, we quite liked those. Also, Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for plug-ins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom features a wide array of advanced features and applications that really make it stand apart from other flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the coolest apps is called Group Play. It shares various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room, but unlike DLNA it's interactive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One use case is to play a music track on the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom and use multiple phones as speakers. You can pick the role of each phone (e.g. left channel, right) all the way up to surround sound. This way you can control the music from one phone but use the loudspeakers of all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the other phones will need to support Group Play - the phones communicate over Wi-Fi (your Galaxy S4 zoom becomes a hotspot that others connect to) and the pairing is done via NFC. Manual pairing is possible too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More useful are the options to share a picture or a document - you can have the same picture appear on everyone's phone and you can draw over it if you need to highlight a certain element of the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, perhaps the coolest feature of Group Play is that it allows for multiplayer games to be played on several phones simultaneously. Of course, only supported games work - there weren't any games preloaded on our unit but you can grab some from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, there's Samsung Link, another way to share content between devices. Unlike Group Play, Samsung Link is intended for just your devices - you can link the phone to a computer that is synced with Dropbox, SkyDrive or SugarSync and remotely access content on that device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Translator will help travelers - it can translate between two languages using either typed text or by using speech recognition. It can read out the resulting translation too, if you don't think your Korean accent can cut it. S Translator supports all the widely-spoken languages - English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese and, of course, Korean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung WatchON is the primary app used with the built-in IR emitter on the top of the phone. The app starts out by asking your zip code and pulls up a number of TV service providers in that area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is so that the app can show you a TV guide with shows currently on or upcoming on the channels offered by the service provider. You can read a description of the show, check out its popularity in up/down votes (and vote yourself, of course) and comments. You can also set reminders for shows you want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the key element of the app is the IR remote control functionality. The app can control TVs, DVD and Blu-ray players and streaming media players. Devices are organized by rooms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we really liked about the app is that it knows some home setups are messy - some let you change channels with the TV remote, others require you to use the set-top box remote for that. Same for the audio, you might be using the TV to output the sound or an AV receiver. The app will ask about your setup and present a unified remote control interface even if you have multiple hardware remotes to control all the devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, S Health is Samsung's home-brewed health and fitness tracking application. It starts off by getting you to create a profile which includes all your vital statistics, such as age/weight/gender and level of activity, plus your calorie consumption goals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides a pleasant interface which gives you an at-a-glance look at your progress, as well as walking, exercise, and fitness trackers. S Health also supports a number of optional accessories, which enables it to give even more detailed info on your status.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Office Editor a no-go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom gives you only the Polaris Office viewer functionality, instead of the full-fledged editor (same goes for all recent Samsung high-end phones). The viewer does not show up in your app drawer, but instead only opens when you select the relevant document from the My Files app. Note that the first time you try this, the phone will prompt you to download the app as it's not installed out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, you can view most document types, including PowerPoint, Word, Excel as well as PDF. It can present the document as is or reflow the text to fit on the screen. There's also a text to speech option, so the phone can read the doc out loud (it will also offer to install a better TTS engine, which weighs in at about 100MB).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is as robust as ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S Planner fills the role of your calendar app, and can be viewed by Day, Week, Month or Year, or by a list of all your upcoming tasks or events. The small squares for each date give only some info on the events for the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. There's also a World clock, stopwatch, and timer. They are easy to work with and can come in handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've been familiar with the S Memo app ever since its debut on the Galaxy Note, and its functionality remains more or less the same. It allows you to create notes either via a virtual keyboard or simply by doodling with your finger. Samsung even sell a special display-friendly ball pen for enthusiasts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps Navigation gives you the most out of GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom comes with a GPS and GLONASS receiver, which got a satellite lock in about a minute with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (or larger) than most dedicated SatNav units, with good sunlight legibility and plenty of storage, money spent towards satellite navigation should go to buying a good app rather than a separate SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 zoom comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play, Samsung Apps and Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Apps features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far lower number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also offers a store for books and games through Samsung Hub. The Book also offers a preview - the first few pages of a book. You can read reviews of the book, written only by people who have bought it. You can also read a synopsis, about the author and search for more books by that author.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section of Samsung Hub just launches Samsung Apps when you tap on a game.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, a phone or a camera, which is it? The Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom tries to be both, but it does better at one than the other. You should've all figured by now that it's the camera we're talking about. The S4 zoom has all the trimmings of a digicam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can certainly do as a phone too, but a lower midranger, and not the most portable handset obviously. We've learned to live with tall and wide phones, but one as thick as the S4 zoom can be too much for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In some cases, however, a crossover device has its advantages - vacationers will always have their camera on them and usually their phone, but with the Galaxy S4 zoom it's just one device to carry around. Similarly, passionate amateur photographers might find that the S4 zoom saves space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But other than that, we don't quite see it as an everyday device, certainly not when high-end smartphone cameras are as good as they are now. One can argue that an Android-powered camera will open new possibilities with its long optical zoom, great stabilization and powerful flash. This is where the Galaxy S4 zoom comes in - it's for early adopters who can't quite afford the Galaxy Camera or the Galaxy NX.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Camera is last year's issue and is basically the same device as the S4 zoom only with more zoom (20x), bigger screen (4.8" 720p) and faster chipset (quad-core Exynos 4). There's no telephony though.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy NX is in a league of its own - it's an interchangeable lens camera (meaning it's a lot more flexible) with a much bigger sensor (APS-C has over 13 times the surface area of the 1/2.33" sensor in the Galaxy S4 zoom) and niceties like a hot shoe for an even more powerful flash than the built-in xenon, not to mention the full range of controls that go further than the S4 zoom's own manual controls.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Then there's the Nokia Lumia 1020 with a 41MP optically stabilized sensor, xenon flash and lossless zoom (when you're shooting at 5MP). It's almost as compact as a proper flagship phone and has higher-end specs than the S4 zoom (4.5" WXGA AMOLED display, 1.5GHz Krait processor, etc.). It's as high as Windows Phone 8 handsets go.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Samsung is making a name for itself as a company that isn't afraid of trying new things. It kick-started the phablet market with its successful Galaxy Note and now it may be about to do the same for the Android-powered cameras. Yes, the Galaxy S4 zoom looks weird, but so did the Note not too long ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Camera has yet to report stunning sales numbers (9 months since launch) and the Galaxy NX might be too pricy to risk it. The Galaxy S4 zoom, however, lets you be an early adopter without a huge investment. At worst, you have a nice point-and-shoot with phone calls and data. At best you have the future. Now.</paragraph>
