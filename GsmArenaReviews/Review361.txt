			<paragraph>LG continues their Black Label series but this time the black is replaced with a bit of silver shine. The new LG KE970 Shine is the first of the truly shiny devices of the Korean manufacturer that landed on our test site. Packing some serious horse power, the LG KE970 Shine is among the most advanced GSM handsets by LG and certainly one of the most attractive ? armed with a 2 megapixel camera with auto focus, a QVGA TFT display, a microSD memory card slot and a number of other goodies it is sure to grab your attention. Read on for more on that exclusive device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main Disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG has made a name for their fashionable handsets. The appearance of the original LG Chocolate took the mobile market by storm. The next high-end mobiles by the manufacturer tried to retain the ?wow? factor while in the same time developing the functionality more and more. The LG KE970 Shine really shined in our hands and in the eyes of all the people around us as it provoked deep interest and fascination. Well, we liked the device at first glance and we were more than hesitant to explore its capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we start with our review, let us just mention that the Shine has a 3G-enabled twin brother ? the LG KU970 Shine. They are real twins but only as far as looks are involved. As it turned out the two handsets are totally different devices when it comes to user interface, hardware used and features implemented. Today we will start by reviewing the KE970 but expect our GSMArena review on KU970 within a week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG KE970 &amp; KU970 Shine side by side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the LG KE970 Shine looks the same as the one of the LG Chocolate, the only difference being the color combination of the box. The standard kit included is pretty much the same too ? a nice and beautiful LG headset, a data cable, and a memory card with market dependent capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KE970 Shine and the retail box</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Being all metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KE970 is not a big handset measuring 99.8 x 50.6 x 13.8 mm but its all metal construction accounts for the hefty weight of 119 g. Honestly, the handset doesn?t feel heavy at all and the added weight in fact adds for a feel of solidness that is rarely seen in modern mobile phones. Design wise, it?s hard to determine whether it might appeal more to men or women. Truth be told, that due to the mirror finish of the front panel, the most men that saw it commented that it?s probably a handset more suitable for women than for men. Our personal opinion is that the device has a unisex design that should find a wide fan base regardless of the sex.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The LG KE970 Shine all over ? real reflections</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset would certainly not win the slimmest phone prize but yet visually it leaves an impression of a really slim device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sliding the LG Shine</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only functional element in the upper part of the front panel is the integrated loudspeaker which is also used as an in-call speaker. Sliding the upper panel reveals the entirely even keypad. As it seems it?s made by a whole metal sheet with the individual keys cut into it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Loudspeaker ? keypad</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Scrolling down<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The central design piece of the KE970 is without a doubt the navigation scroller and the soft keys. The scroller is not a new navigation solution in the mobile world but it hasn?t been used for quite some time now. There is more to the LG navigation than what the eye reveals. There are two more keys integrated into each side of the scroller but they are far from obvious. They don?t seem much like keys at all and you can easily miss their presence ? we failed to spot them when we saw the LG Shine for the first time at the 3GSM Congress at Barcelona this year. These keys expand the capabilities of the scroller since they allow for side movement in the user interface. The other two soft keys which are positioned further away are contextual keys ? they again are entirely made of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Shine navigation solution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all is said and done however the LG scroller managed to disappoint us from the very beginning. Let?s just say that it doesn?t even closely resemble the regular PC mouse scroller. The scrolling navigation was not as responsive as you?d expect it to be ? sometimes a scroll didn?t make any movement in the user interface, sometimes it did more than one. More than often it reacted slower that one would like. Generally, working your way through the menu system required a lot of movement from your thumb and when you add to that the stiffness of the navigation keys and the scroller itself when pressed ? the LG Shine navigation provided for a really unpleasant, thumb-itching and tiring experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough on that, let?s return to our description. The right side of the LG Shine is pretty bare and doesn?t feature any control elements. You may spot the neck strap eyehole in the upper part if you pay attention. In much the same way the bottom and upper parts are also bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Right side ? Bottom side ? Top side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is much more interesting as it features the charger/headset port cap, the dual volume key, the MP3 shortcut key and the camera shutter key. The MP3 shortcut key can be used to minimize the MP3 player while playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Charger/headset port, volume key, music player key, camera key</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the handset around reveals the brushed aluminum back cover and the camera. Looking at it that way, the LG Shine looks like a portable digital camera. Sleek and chic ? those two words can round it up for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG back panel ? camera lens, LED and self-portrait mirror ? the back of the slider</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel covers the whole back side of the handset. When you remove it, the 750mAh Li-Ion battery is revealed as well as the SIM card bed. The memory card slot is situated just under the SIM card bed. As far as battery durability is concerned, well we will not even quote the manufacturer suggested numbers as it managed to quickly disappoint us. Draining it was a matter of a day. But as we saw with the LG KU970 which has almosost the same battery (800 mAh) and presumably a higher power consumption as it works in a 3G network, our guess is that the battery of our test KE970 unit was simply gone for good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    gsmarena_031.jpg Removing the back panel ? SIM card bed ? pulling the memory card out ? Li-Ion battery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve seen mobiles with displays that have a certain mirror finish but the LG Shine beats them all with its high gloss reflective display surface. As you can see, when the display is off you can hardly see there is a display out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The glossy LG Shine</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally we were really happy with the design and construction of the LG KE970. The metal body felt good when held in hand and we although the mobile is a bit on the heavy side ? it really is comfortable to use it and carry it in your jeans or shirt pocket.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>More on usability<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Shine display provided for a nice experience ? whether outside or indoors. The legibility remained tolerable under direct sunlight ? something that we didn?t expect having in mind its mirror-like finish. The QVGA resolution is pretty adequate and the images shown on the display were fine and wonderful colors. The brightness levels are user configurable but they provided enough flexibility to allow using the handset with an ease both under strong light and in complete darkness.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>When it comes to the keypad, we would no longer comment on the navigation part, but we would concentrate on the alphanumeric part. Typing messages was not the easiest thing to do since there are no tactile differences between neighboring keys. Other than that the individual keys themselves have a nice feedback and typing phone numbers was a pleasant thing to do. It?s got to be noted that as with most sliders, the upper row of the keypad wasn?t easily accessible. The green receiver key proved especially hard to get to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys pad has a nice but somewhat uneven blue backlighting as you may see from the pictures taken in total darkness.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Integrated dual ringer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KE970 Shine does great at making and receiving calls. The sound volume is satisfactory. Much like the KG800 the KE970 doesn?t have a dedicated loud speaker and instead uses the in-call speaker on the front panel for the ringing melodies. The vibration is not that strong too. Having in mind that dual purpose of the speaker it comes as no surprise that the sound during conversations is really loud and clear. That provides for pleasant conversations even in noisy streets. The MP3 ringing is also nice and clear but really lacks bass elements.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG interface doesn?t bring any surprises<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standby screen of the handset displays info about the battery status and signal strength. The carrier?s name can be turned off and we find that a really pleasant feature that should be seen in other phones too. In standby the two soft keys correspond to the Main Menu and the Contacts list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Standby screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is a 3 x 3 grid of icons which get animated when you select them. The graphic icons are different as opposed to those used in the LG Chocolate lineup. Each icon is marked with a number so you can use the corresponding numeric keys as shortcuts for the menu items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The submenus are viewed as a list. Once you open a menu item you can scroll to the other menu items with the navigation roller without the need for returning to the main menu. Here are the nice wallpapers that come preinstalled with the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Some of the preset wallpapers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no themes available for customizing the looks of the interface, but there is the option to change the menu style. Beside the regular 3x3 grid you are given the opportunity to use the list style menu. Unfortunately the highly attractive Arc style we saw in LG KE800 Platinum is not among the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  List style menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In standby the four ways of the navigation roller each has a predefined shortcut function. If you wish you could visualize the respective assigned functions of the standby screen in order to make your life easier. We found it a preferred option in the first couple of days we used the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the LEFT key takes you to the Contacts list. Scrolling DOWN key takes you to the Profiles list. Pressing the RIGHT key takes you to a Favorites menu which is a list of shortcuts which is user-configurable. Scrolling UP key opens the message Inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Standby screen shortcut menu ? Favorites menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a good thing that all the submenu items have numeric shortcuts assigned to them. You can see those in front of every menu item while browsing the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Numeric shortcut icons in the beginning of each row</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also an interesting option to colorize the phone numbers when dialing in order to distinguish the individual numbers more easily. Or you can choose the other dialing graphics mode that is also interesting. Whether you would like one of those is entirely up to your taste, of course.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is the same too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the LG KE970 Shine is better than the one of the LG KG800 Chocolate and is in fact the updated version that we saw implemented in LG KE800 Platinum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts capacity is 1000 contacts which is more than enough. Search is performed through gradual typing of a name?s characters. The phonebook allows the storing of 4 numbers /mobile, home, office, fax/ and an email. Further on the contact can be included into a caller group or can be assigned a picture. You can add a note to the contact too. It?s good to see that the phonebook has received a facelift and now looks much more user friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Phonebook ? various contact fields</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned any contact can be assigned a picture. The original KG800 was pretty much handicapped in that respect since it allowed only .bmp pictures to be used with 72 x 72 pixels size. The KE800 had that fixed and you were free to use any picture of your choosing. Now again there are strict limitations ? in order to use the picture as a contact image it has to be a JPG file with a size of 640x480 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual you can view the contacts along with their respective pictures. It?s a cool, but poses certain inconvenience since the picture hides some characters from the contacts names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing the contacts with pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign a ringtone to individual contacts as in KE800 Platinum. The only way to do that in the original LG KG800 Chocolate is by including the contact in a caller group and assigning a specific ringtone to the caller group itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has several preinstalled caller groups which can be customized. Each caller group has its icon and that can be shown in front of the respective members? names in the contacts list in order to recognize easily which group they belong to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Caller groups list with their respective icons</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with LG KE800 Platinum you can save a second or a third number to an already existing contact directly from the standby screen ? something impossible in the original Chocolate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nothing special in the call records department. They are available as a separate item in the main menu and also can be accessed by pressing the call (receiver) key. In fact pressing the call key takes you to the general list of all dialed, received and missed calls. If you wish to see the separate registers you have to go to the abovementioned Call History menu item. The GPRS data counter is also available in the Call History menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Call register menu</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging makes it easy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports the sending and receiving of SMS, EMS, MMS and email messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start a new message you are given the option of choosing among a text message, multimedia message, an email or Bluetooth message. The Bluetooth messaging is something new for LG mobiles. If you choose the text type further on you could easily change it by just attaching multimedia content to it and thus turn it into an EMS or MMS. As with KE800 Platinum the EMS functionality is not on the level of the original LG Chocolate for some unknown reason. There you could type with highlighted text, set the text alignment, etc. None of those features is available here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messages menu ? insert message options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message typing is assisted by T9. A nice feature is that if you have started a new message and all of a sudden you have to cancel its typing, it?s saved automatically as a draft and next time you decide to start a new message the phone not only stores it for you but automatically opens it for you to continue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice feature is that the phone keeps a record of the last numbers you have sent messages to and when sending a new one you can choose among them instead of digging down in the full phonebook list. It?s a feature we would like to see in more phones nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports the POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP protocols and as regards sending and receiving text emails it successfully does it job as we managed to found out during the test period. As regards emails with file attachments it poses rather strict limitations. The maximum size for one sent or downloaded message is 300KB. In case you have received message with more than 5 attachments, only 5 of them will be received. For each email account you may save up to 50 messages (totally 150 for three accounts), while in the Inbox you can store up to 30 messages for each account. The other 20 slots are reserved for the Drafts and Outbox folders. A good thing is that there is an option to provide a separate username and password for the SMTP server.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Office and imaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KE970 has 50MB of integrated memory and a microSD memory card slot. The effectively available memory to the user in fact is around 48MB. The file manager appears as a My stuff item in the main menu. It includes separate factory preset folders for different multimedia content. In fact these folders are the only one you will see since the file manager doesn?t actually support user-created folders. You can create such folders using the computer and the USB cable of course, but they do not get listed in the My Stuff menu. You can mark, copy or move files only within the designated multimedia group. For example you cannot copy image files to the music folder. Then again you can of course copy or move files to the external memory or send them through Bluetooth connection and for all of those options you can rely on multiple marking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> File manager</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new folder as compared to the LG KE800 Platinum is the Documents folder. In fact it represents the office document viewer functionality of the KE970. It?s a rather innovative feature for a non-OS mobile phone and it?s certainly a first for LG GSM mobile phones. As we managed to confirm, the viewer supports MS Word documents, MS Excel files and PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Documents folder ? viewing a MS Word, an Acrobat and an MS Excel file</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally speaking, the file browser of the LG KE970 Shine provides basic functionality but offers some upgrades over previous versions. As with LG KE800 Platinum you no longer need to view picture files by opening and closing them one by one as it was with the original LG Chocolate phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrary to the LG KE800 you can view pictures fullscreen and what is more you can even browse them in landscape mode. You can even see the pictures in their full size while making use of a nice browsing feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing a picture in landscape mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Zooming in on a picture</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thumbnail view browsing of the available pictures has received a speed boost and now it works much more natural . All of those are a real progress for the LG user interface and we haven?t seen them in previous models. It must be noted though that in this respect LG phones lag a lot behind Sony Ericsson phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Playing the tracks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The lack of memory card slot, a flight mode, and playlist support made the music player of the original LG Chocolate rather inadequate. Some of those issues have been taken care of in the LG KE800 Chocolate Platinum. But still, it lacked an option for creating custom playlists ? its player listed all the available MP3 files. The KE970 Shine however now supports user-created playlists and we are pretty happy with it. The only downside is that as with all previous models you can?t sort the tracks according to artist or album but only by file name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    MP3 player ? filtering tracks ? all songs ? player interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player can now work in the background. There are several equalizer presets that you can use in order to enhance the player sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Player settings ? equalizer presets</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound is really nice when you use stock headphones without turning on some special equalizer preset. However, when you use the supplied LG headphones you would be better off with the Rock preset.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>We liked the camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were not that excited with the results from the camera of the KE800 Platinum so the 2 megapixel auto focus camera of the KE970 Shine didn?t impress us much. The auto focus capability of the device though turned out much better and didn?t miss most of its intended subjects as it did with the KE800 Platinum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera interface</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of speed there isn?t that much of an upgrade - it takes around 9 seconds to take a picture at the maximum resolution and save it as compared to 10 seconds in KE800. The auto focus though has gained speed and instead 4 it takes only 2 seconds to focus on its subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Macro mode was among the strongest sides of the KE800 Platinum and it didn?t disappoint here either with great results when taking pictures of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is also equipped with a LED flash which is there to help you in poor light conditions. Speaking of poor light conditions, the camera of the KE970 doesn?t have a night mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera menu offers option such as picture resolution, brightness level, the white balance that has several presets according to the available light conditions, and some color effects such as sepia, black &amp; white, negative, etc. Beside the regular Single shot mode the camera can also capture images in Multi shoot mode which takes 3 or 6 pictures in a quick succession.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Various camera settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the 2 megapixel autofocus camera with Schneider-Kreuznach certified lens is a mixed bag. We were pleasantly surprised by the macro mode ? the camera can focus from really close distance and capture really fine details. The outdoor photos are not bad, but we noticed a slight tendency for overexposure, which makes the colors somewhat washed out. Indoor the photos turned out very good, but they were taken during different time of the day when the light in the mall is stronger, so the results can?t be directly compared to other phones we reviewed recently. Together with KE970 we tested the 3G KU970 model, which comes with identical (at least on paper) lens. We expected similar results, but it turned out that KU970 performed better ? you can compare for yourself once our KU970 review is published.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of overall performance, in our opinion KE970 can?t compete with Sony Ericsson K750 and company. The overall quality of the LG Shine can be compared to the Sony Ericsson K550 for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>              Sample LG KE970 Shine camera photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also captures video in maximum resolution of 176 x 144 pixels and the output format is the usual .3gp. The menu of the video camera is pretty much the same as the one we already described for the still camera with few exceptions. It offers both limited and unlimited recording. A quirky solution is that you can?t switch to video mode directly from the camera menu. You have to stop the still camera application first and then open the dedicated Video camera application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KE970 Shine sample video</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: great as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone features full USB support and the LG USB cable comes along in the retail box along with the phone itself. The great thing about the USB support of the phone is that when connected, the phone memory and the memory card both appear in the Windows explorer as removable drives just as your regular USB flash drive would with no special drivers needed. Unfortunately, we registered pretty low data transfer speeds when using the handset ? the meager 33 KB/s when copying to the phone and 500 KB/s when copying to the computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you receive a call while in mass storage mode, the call will be rejected but after you disconnect the handset, you will see the information about any missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Standby display while in USB drive mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you need any other type of synchronization between the phone and the PC like for items such as the phonebook and the schedule you should use the dedicated LG software LGPCSync that comes on CD along with the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Revamped web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As much as connectivity is concerned, the phone features 3-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE 900/1800/1900, as well as Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated WAP browser in the previous LG GSM phones we reviewed didn?t have full HTML support and managed to open only simple HTML pages such as Google. It was a regular WAP browser used in older phones and it wasn?t even able to open the GSMArena.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the contrary, the browser integrated in the KE970 Shine is on par with the web browsers used in most recent mobile phones which is a big development for LG. Still it doesn?t feature zoom and landscape mode, but well we can live without that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all you can always install the Opera Mini Browser as an additional Java application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The new LG web browser</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calendar and other tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward ? it offers a monthly view for navigation among the dates. Once you find the date you need, simply enter it and add an event. Finally, the first day of the week is Monday. All the previous LG mobiles we have reviewed had the week starting on Sunday ? something that?s not that common around whole Europe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Calendar: monthly view ? adding a task</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Memos feature that allows for storing some notes. Each note can have a maximum of 80 characters. The Tools menu also stores some other useful applications, though they seem rather standard nowadays. There is the Alarm clock, the Calculator, the Unit converter, the Stop watch and the World time clock. Much like on KE800 Platinum the Alarm clock allows for setting only one alarm, which can be repeated. It?s a certain downgrade since the original KG800 Chocolate allowed for the setting of 5 different alarms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Alarm clock: only one alarm!?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator is completely redesigned to work with seamlessly with the new navigation solution and offers two modes ? a regular calculator and a scientific one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calculator: basic and science mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Unit Converter also has a nice list of units such as Currency, Area, Length, Weight, Temperature, Volume, and Velocity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Unit converter application ? converting area units</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Time application is among the nicest we?ve seem ? it really manages to please the eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  World Time application</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder application is not found in the Tools menu but in the Multimedia menu instead. Much like the KE800 Platinum it has no limitation in the duration of the recorded files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The voice recorder</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone we tested had two preinstalled game ? Bubble Soccer and Fishing Mania. In Bubble Soccer you shoot soccer balls on balls of the same color until you manage to clear them all. As the name itself implies, Fishing Mania is a fishing game. It seems rather complicated at first sight because of the various rules and equipment used by your fisherman but it is really enjoyable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Bubble soccer &amp; Fishing mania</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we?ve seen so far the LG KE970 is among the most mature GSM product of the Korean manufacturer that is trying to build its reputation of offering not only fashionable but also high-tech mobile products. Well LG has managed to score great in both fields since the LG KE970 Shine is a great-looking phone which is also the most feature-rich device in the manufacturer?s product lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it weren?t for the clumsy navigation solution we would have recommended it wholeheartedly as a great fashion multimedia device. As we saw in the 3G-enabled KU970 Shine the design of the navigation roller is not inherently bad it just needs to be tweaked better. As far as battery life is concerned we really couldn?t understand what drained the battery so quickly ? the KU970 again scored way better in this field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So after getting our low down on the pros and cons of the device in the end of the day it?s you that should take the final buying decision. All in all, the LG KE970 Shine is a great device that managed to warm our hearts.</paragraph>
