			<paragraph>When Nokia presented its first models of the elite N series in April this year, they took many people's breath away. The idea of the Finish manufacturer about this series is to offer mobiles that feature top class-technologies and to provide this way the best possible equipment in a mobile device. As a result of these efforts the new models N91, N90 and N70 were brought to the world. All three models are equipped with the operation system Symbian Series 60 and feature an exceptional variety of functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nokia N91</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one constitutes the very top of this Series. The main lure of this device is the built-in hard disk with a capacity of 4 GB. Most of all, this phone is meant to serve music fans. However, it also offers a 2 megapixel camera and a serious amount of functions. The phone has a classic construction with a slide cover keypad, but it is marked by a notably bigger weight and size. On the lowest step of the virtual evaluative ladder is situated the N70 model. Its design could hardly impress most mobile users, but at least, it fits into the weight and size category of most current smart phones. Its target customer group is the one of the most pretentious users, who need a phone combining both work and fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nokia N70</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The futuristic clamshell N90 stands on a step lower than the N91 model. There is no doubt that it will be welcome with excitement by all fans of digital photography. Beside the standard extended functional menu, it also offers a 2 megapixel camera, whose optics pride on the hallmark of Carl Zeiss, the manufacturer, whose optic equipment and lenses made him famous all over the world. Of course, here you will find a memory card slot and also one of the finest displays ever. This last model is the first one to hit the market, so it also was the first to undergo our severe tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nokia N90 displays all its beauty</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are testing the final version of the phone with firmware V2.0527.2.3 RM-42 (from June 7th, 2005)  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update August 1st: In fact two phones were tested - both with final firmware and in retail package, both phones with no vibration. Let's see if this will end the vibration saga in the opinion section.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A solid piece of phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N90 is the second Nokia smart phone, which has a clamshell type construction. The first one was the 6260 model, known for its square body and metal covers. 6260 used to be criticised for its enormous weight and slightly bigger size. In this aspect, however, the new model scores even worse. It weighs the shocking 173 grams, due to which Nokia N90 overruns even big communicators like Sony Ericsson P910i (155 g), for example, or even Nokia 9300 (167 g). As for the size, this mobile is a real "fatty boy". It is 112 mm long, 51 mm wide and 24 mm high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Equipment had to be fit somewhere...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Due to its bigger size and weight, N90 is not another small pocket toy anymore. I did not stand this stone in my pocket for a long time and soon it was travelling into my bag. Even though the phone feels quite comfortable in one's hand, the place, from which one's pointing finger usually backs up the phone, is now occupied by the bulgy bed of the camera. As a result, the phone is likely to overweight forwards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Unpacking - beside everything else, the box hides a software CD and a data cable </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Is this still a clamshell?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apparently, Nokia engineers felt like letting out the ghost from the bottle when they were working on N90. It has two joints instead of the standard one, opening this way space for a tiny cuboid, on which the camera was mounted. In addition, the camera works on the principle of rotating - if the lens looks to the left, you can turn the camera part to the right up to an angle of 180° or to the left in an angle of 135°. Unfortunately, a full 360° rotation is not possible. Every 90° the camera runs into a lock, which prevents it from possible unwilling rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  Is this a phone at all?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main display rotates as well. It does so from its standard position to the right only, up to an angle of a little bit over 90°. The display stops in two arresting positions: its basic position and at the end of its rotating move to the right. In addition, there are four locks in the main joints of the phone, which determine the four basic positions of the whole mobile:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1. Phone is closed  ? both main parts are closed, the camera is aligned to them, which makes the phone look as a cuboid. The camera lens can look to both sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>2. Camera mode  ? both main parts are closed, the camera part deflects in such way that the lens can look to the side opposite to the side the outer display looks at. The outer display also serves as a viewfinder of the camera. The camera application is managed through the control buttons placed on the top edge of the device. It starts automatically once the lens part is even slightly turned. The display can also be used as a mirror for self-portraits, provided you direct the camera to the opposite side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3. Phone is open  ? main parts are fully open, the camera part gets into a crosswise position (it allows rotating, which does not make the camera application start running automatically). The main control elements here are the main keypad and the main display. All functions of the phone are freely approachable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>4. Camera mode  ? the top part of the phone gets opened up to a position, in which it contains a right angle together with the bottom part. The main display turns by 90°, the camera lens get set to look to the side, which is opposite to the one the main display looks at. The display itself fulfils the functions of a viewfinder. Having been even slightly turned, the camera application automatically starts running. This mode also allows you to activate the video recording application or view the picture gallery. The main keypad is non-active. The right hand controls both the joystick and the release button on the sideway of the phone, whilst the left hand controls the buttons above the display. This mode is also used for video conversations in 3G networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Holding the phone in a the camera mode </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the construction is superb. Rotating parts smoothly bottom into their resting positions. The moment of locking is accompanied by a muffle click. Everything moves effortlessly, contra reactions are light. Moving parts show no signs of contra will. Even though all mentioned details should be considered relevant and expected from any mobile of such a class and price, Nokia deserves our congratulations. My only uncertainty was awakened by the creaks given out by the cover of the phone's bottom part in the area around the keypad. On the other side, they are not constantly present, but come out under stronger pressure only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  The joint often resembles a brain-teaser </paragraph>
			<paragraph> Manipulations with the phone (AVI, DivX 5.2, 2.8 MB) </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Patience pays dividends<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Laid on a table Nokia N90 effuses dignity. It has the form of a cuboid and looks very impressive thanks to its bigger parameters. No experiments have been done in terms of materials. Plastics have been used everywhere. There are two color shades in the game - a silver one and a dark grey, nearly black one. All plastic surfaces are matt, so fingerprints are not visible at all, except on the glossy frame around the outer display. This frame, featuring manufacturer's logo, makes the display look optically bigger. Both the display and its frame are mounted into a dark plastic plate, which is surrounded by silver plastics - as you can see, extravagance has been totally abandoned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    No experiments in terms of materials, forms or colors - is it Nokia at all? </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same design dominates in the camera part. On its upper side is situated the switch on/off button of the device, next to which is the tiny slot of the loud speaker. The dark plastic surface continues on to the back side of the phone, where it creates the removable part of the back cover. The margins are silver. Although the cover is extremely thin it holds firmly on its place. Under it you will find a lithium-ion accumulator of 760 mAh, which is expected to guarantee durability of up to three hours of phone calls and 300 hours of a stand-by mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The legend promises high quality pictures with the camera ? switch off button and speaker slot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the accumulator is situated the slot for the SIM card, which is possible to remove without having to ease off the accumulator. This feature appears intentional since the phone is able to work offline, with the phone part of the device not being functional. In this mode, the SIM card can be easily replaced without the necessity of switching off the phone - very convenient indeed, considering the fact that starting the phone takes almost an entire minute! Believe me that this minute may seem endless, if you need to work with the phone urgently. Once started, the phone reacts immediately, even if full of contact names and active applications in the background. Of course, the bigger the number of those applications, the slower the speed. The picture gallery is the other application that makes the phone "breathe heavily", especially when it is completely full.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Back side ? cover lock ? view at what is hidden behind the back cover </paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the moment, I am totally disappointed by the durability of this Nokia model. Understandably, during the preparation of the current review the phone was extremely loaded with various functions and processes. Very few mobiles survive more than two days with a single charging if used under similar circumstances. Unfortunately, Nokia N90 did not make it even for an entire day. Even though the battery state indicator kept showing no signs of instability, at a certain moment of the falling evening it suddenly displayed a low battery alert and a moment or so afterwards the phone turned off. Anyway, it is not the time for final evaluations yet. The phone is going to be tested in our office for several more days, so we will keep on checking its right durability characteristics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad made for male hands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The inside of the mobile is also dominated by plastics in the darker shade of the grey. The display, decorated with a thin glossy frame, is enchased in the upper area of the moving part of the phone. Above it is the receiver, placed between two buttons. Engraved below it is the famous logo of the manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The camera makes the phone stay in an inclined position when placed on a horizontal surface ? two buttons mounted above the display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the spacey bottom part of the display is occupied by the keypad. The manufacturer evidently had no reason to be thrifty on space as all keys are big enough even for the usually larger male fingers. Below the bottom key line and the bottom edge of the phone there is quite a notable distance, which prevents the thumb from crumbling, and helps it comfortably lie on the surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad is huge ? as are also the keys themselves ? at the bottom there is a gum strip, which guarantees soft bottoming of the phone's upper part </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main control element is the round navigation key with four active ways. Its centre is reserved for the confirming button, which is slightly elevated and therefore shows a little bit unsure reaction when pressed. Presses on each individual way are sure. All presses are confirmed by a muffle click. In order to look optically bigger and more impressive, the main control component is silver, whilst the confirm button is white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main control button </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The round navigation key is surrounded by functional buttons, which are already obligatory- two context keys - the red and green ones plus the enter menu key and the key serving the options of text entering and deleting. The functional part passes smoothly into the numeric part and thus complicates touch orientation a little bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad detail </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric part of the phone constitutes of huge keys, organized in a block. The touch orientation among the different keys is guaranteed by phone's bevelled edges and the lower bedding of the middle key column. Pressing is low and is accompanied by the already typical click that could have been a bit more muffle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In my opinion, the plastic elaboration of the keys seems much too cheap in relation to the exclusivity and the price of this Nokia model. Another disturbing factor for me was the size of the keypad. On one hand, it supposes easier writing for users with bigger fingers. On the other hand, however, it tires the thumb if the writing process takes longer. The keypad background light is white, even and strong enough. It gets activated only in case of insufficient light conditions. The latter are checked and evaluated by a sensor, mounted under the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Backlight is very good; it gets activated if necessary only </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let's look at it from aside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The side parts of the device are silver colored. The Pop-Port system connector has been given an unusual place, on the left side of the phone. It is accompanied by the thin jack for the charger. The very same jack was used in the 6101 clamshell. Unlike the current chargers, the connector of Nokia N90 is extremely thin. To charge the phone with an older charger, use the adapter, which is available in the delivery package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Phone's left side ? system connector is secured by a cap... ? ...that you will almost immediately lose ? charger and adapter for older model types </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the phone is even. The only element here is the tiny microphone slot together with the eyelet for interlacing a strip, placed at the edge of the mobile's bottom. The phone is delivered together with a nice leather strip. The right side is the most interesting. Here you will find a tiny door, which secures the memory card slot, as well as a five-way joystick, accompanied by a bulgy button, which starts the camera mode. The important role of this joystick gets visible in the camera mode, where it controls the menu. It is stable and easy to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Phone's right side ? the joystick, which controls the camera, is situated on the right side </paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The door of the memory card slot is closed... ? ...and open ? eyelet for interlacing a strip ? leather strip and cloth delivered together with the mobile</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the sides of the camera part of the device is plain. On the other one there is a glass that secures the camera lens. It has a serrated silver frame. Next to it is the strong flash diode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera is equipped with a diode flash </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The best display in a mobile ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The quality of the displays of all current Symbian Nokia models is very good. Yet, some critics have already raised voices, according to which the 176 × 208 pixels resolution is insufficient. On a surface of 35 × 41 mm a single square centimetre fit in 2551 pixels. Some modern phones are equipped with displays, featuring almost twice as many pixels on a square cm. The new Nokia 6230i (4807 pixels), Panasonic VS3 (5020 pixels) or Sagem MY X-8 (5020 pixels) are only a few examples. The praised display of the new Sony Ericsson K750 has 3709 pixels on a sq. cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main display of Nokia N90 keeps the original size of the displays of all previous Nokia models with Symbian. The difference lies in its resolution, which is four times higher! Yes, there is no mistake. This phone uses a grid of 352 × 416 pixels on a tiny surface of 35 × 41 mm, which means that it displays the unbelievable 10204 pixels on a square cm! If you also add the amount of 262K, the picture you get is almost ideal</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The picture can hardly show the incredible quality of the display </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start Nokia N90 your excitement may be cold showered. Apparently, the animated introduction logo with two shaking hands has not been optimized to display the characteristics of the new display, so everything looks just like it did before. Once the user environment has appeared, however, one can do nothing but stare with astonishment. Font and icons are perfectly clear, photographs look as if printed on glossy paper, individual pixels are impossible to recognize without using a magnifying glass. The only defect I ran into was the slightly yellowish nuance of the white color, which is however impossible to observe in normal use. In addition, you will have to do with somewhat poorer readability, when the display is positioned under direct daylight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  What once used to be the main display of the high-class 6230 model is an additional outer display in the new Nokia N90 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The outer display is identical to the main displays of most of the models of Series 40. It is active, offers a 128 × 128 pixels resolution on a square surface of 27 × 27 mm and is able to display 65K colors. As it is an outer or supplemental display, the parameters quoted above are respectable. But if you work some time with the inside display and then switch to the outer one, your will see the difference. The problem is that compared to the inner display this one looks much too common and "boring".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Sample view at the outer display (stand-by mode, ringing, displaying information, waiting for a voice order, camera mode in a horizontal handhold)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If not active, the outer display is showing the time in big inverse numbers. It is very easy to read, even without backlighting. When there are missed events, they are symbolized by tiny icons. When the display gets activated (for example, when you close the phone, press the joystick etc. ...), the stand-by mode starts running. It displays details about the current date, time, the name of the mobile operator, the network intensity state, the charge level of the accumulator, and of course, it shows the icons alerting missed events. To view those events, simply use the joystick. There is no need to open the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Compatibility of the new environment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The changes made in the display resolution carry along the question of how these changes can be dealt with by the current version of the Symbian system and the applications available for Symbian Series 60. At first glance, everything seems much quite the same. The user's environment has been left unchanged. Only the picture features better colors and displays more details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to find more, I installed one of the most favourite applications among users - FExplorer - and sat down waiting. The icon of this program looks ugly and edgy in comparison to the rest of the icons. The same holds true for the icons and the font inside the program. Nonetheless, it works without problems, which is still the most important thing. The majority of the programs work well too. Graphic motives are also compatible. Icons and pictures adjusted to lower resolution declass the quality of the display. To my disappointment, the phone has only one graphic theme, which is moreover utterly basic, with white background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Speak out loud!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even with different resolution display, Symbian Series 60 remains the same in respect to user's environment and functions. What is notable is the modification in the design - font is smoothed, 3D menu icons are well elaborated... The owners of older Symbian phones will probably find the Active stand-by mode quite interesting. The main display shows an overview of the most recent issues from the calendar or the number of non-executed tasks. Here, you will also find temporary files of the most frequently used applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Main display with the Active stand-by mode on ? missed calls and messages alert </paragraph>
			<paragraph>But for Nokia 6681's owners this function is not new; they already have it in their mobiles. I just like to remind you that you can deactivate the Active stand-by mode. If you do so, the standard picture, clock and state icons on the display will keep their places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Applications and functions menu </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu consists of 9 icons, whose tags get open rolling vertically. Icons can be filtered and organized into folders. The phone offers a line-like configuration as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Environment is possible to change according to graphic motives </paragraph>
			<paragraph>A piece of news is the voice control option. Not because older Nokia models lacked it, but because Nokia N90 is able to recognize orders, which were not entered prior into the phone. You just need to press and hold the camera release button, situated on the right side of the phone, and speak out your wish simultaneously. This way you can also change profiles, activate Bluetooth or the mailbox, or dial voice mail number. What a pity that the phone does not allow more types of orders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> You can replay your voice orders </paragraph>
			<paragraph>This technology has been also used in the phonebook. As a result, each saved name is automatically given a voice nomination too. When a name is pronounced in the same way, in which it was saved in the phone book, the priority number assigned to it is automatically dialled (i.e. mobile number, landline number, etc.). In every such dial up the phone confirms your choice by reading out the name of the called person. Initially, its electronic voice may evoke a smile on your face, but very soon this smile will turn into anger when you find that dialling a number this way is virtually almost impossible. It is obvious that this function is not "elaborated" well enough yet and is therefore virtually useless.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phone calls: pure excellence<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No matter how packed with various multimedia functions Nokia N90 is, it is first and most of all a mobile phone with brilliant phone equipment. It works in GSM networks at 900, 1800 and 1900 MHz and even in third generation networks like WCDMA 2100, which allow video conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound coming from the earphones is good, but yet standard. Remarkably clear are the bass elements in the sound of the loud speaker. On the other hand, the sound of the middle and higher tones seemed to me somehow garbled. But as a whole, N90's volume characteristics - the most important for any mobile phone - are brilliant. No resonance or creaky sounds were detected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing is supported by polyphonic melodies or any MP3 or AAC files. You can modify it using different ringing profiles. The fastest way to activate these is to use the switch off button. In addition, the menu offers a keypad lock option, extraction of the memory card or an offline mode option. By activating the latter you turn off the part communication with the GSM network as well as its assigned functions, but the phone remains available for common work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The phone searches the address book by both name and surname ? inserting a new entry</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone book is a multi-item one. It uses the shared memory of the phone, which amounts to 31 MB. 500 names without pictures use up to 200 KB, so you should not worry about possible lack of space. Pictures are one of altogether 30 fields that can be assigned to each name. As for special ringing melodies, they can only be assigned to groups, around which all contacts are organized. Filters are a matter of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No news in messages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Compared to the 6681 model Nokia N90 has undergone no modifications in respect to messages. SMS writing can be fastened by activating the T9 dictionary. The SMS editor has remained unchanged. It provides information about the number of used so far messages as well as the number of characters still left in the current message. SMS are not limited by a certain number, but by the capacity of the free shared memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Messages menu ? writing SMS ? creating MMS </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor has remained unchanged. You can send messages as big as 300 KB. No modifications have been made in the email client either. It downloads message headers, reduces the size of the downloaded emails, sets a regular mailbox check etc. A matter of course is work with attachments. The email client manages POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP protocols.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Downloading emails ? received mails overview ? viewing emails</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Opening a picture attachment and a Word document </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Push to talk function is not present in the current Nokia N90 firmware. However, you can download it free directly from Nokia N90 support page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent companion not only in the office<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual, all organizing functions are accurately elaborated. The calendar is very well organized and offers a month, a week and a day view as well as the option for inserting three types of events - a meeting, a note and an anniversary. These events are more than enough for quick and successful work. If there were more of them, they might cause confusion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Month, week and day view at the calendar </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N90 has both a task and note applications. Among the extra functions you will also find a measure converter. Some of the most interesting applications here are Quicksheet, Quickword and Quickpoint, all three of which help you browse documents created in Microsoft Office. Everything works smoothly. As the relevant application opens automatically, attachments and emails can be viewed immediately. Reading PDF documents is also possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Notes ? tasks ? dictaphone ? extra applications menu for viewing documents </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, two of the traditional Symbian variances have not been corrected. The first one is the alarm clock, which lacks the repetition option; the other one is the dictaphone, which allows only one-minute long records.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the operational system is open, you can always download any necessary additional applications. The phone uses Java applications, whose speed results are worth our attention. Nokia scored 1862 points in the JBenchmark 1.0 test and 97 points in the JBenchmark 2.0 test. In comparison to other Symbian Nokia models, such results appear quite miserable. Obviously, this low score is caused by the higher resolution of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the extra applications menu you will also find the beloved Lifeblog program. Each new Nokia N90 owner obtains an activating code for this software in order to be able to use its full version free of charge.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Did Carl Zeiss fail?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update: Please read the separate Nokia N90 camera review. The review you are reading now is based on the old version of the firmware, so some of the negative notes in this section are not valid any more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is one of the strongest lures in Nokia N90. The main reason is that its optic qualities are guaranteed by the name of Carl Zeiss - the top-class manufacturer of lenses and optical equipment. The optics along with the camera's sensor with 2 megapixel resolution constitute an extraordinary combination.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Setting the phone in a shooting position (AVI, DivX 5.2, 1.8 MB) </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia did not hesitate, but supported N90's high quality equipment by appropriate high quality applications. Its camera may even be appreciated by experienced photographers, because of the options for manual adjustments. The phone offers 7 scenic modes. The white color balance can be adjusted according to the type of the surrounding light. There is also an option for exposure compensation as well as an option for choosing the relevant color shade of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera's viewfinder ? camera's menu </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a self timer and continuous shooting option. Pictures can be taken in three different sizes - 1600 × 1200 pixels, 800 × 600 pixels or 640 × 480 pixels. In the menu you will find a digital zoom, which works in a combination with crops and interpolations. After the first several focusing steps the resolution remains unchanged, but if you go on, picture becomes smaller and smaller till it gets displayed in VGA resolution, which is interpolated further on. This way the digital zoom is 20x. In practice, however, the result of such zoom will be nothing but a loss of quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera functions selection ? mode selection ? other settings </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera focuses automatically. The first picture result may horrify you for it is much smudged. To focus the scene you will have to half-press the release button several times till the focus indicator turns green. The pity is that this process takes sometimes three long seconds. If you are impatient, your photo is likely to get out of focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample pictures  (Full 2MP resolution, 300-500 KB each):</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When light conditions are acceptable, the camera takes very good photos. Yet, we can hardly speak of exceptional performance for it has already been a while since Sony Ericsson K750i - the brilliant 2 megapixel photo mobile - was launched on the market. This is also where the surprise caused by certain minuses of N90' camera functions rise from. The most notable disadvantage is related to scenes scanned at a short distance - although the camera has a macro function, it is not able to focus such scenes well. If focusing comes out well, there is a notable "softness" in the result. The same problem is visible in photos taken from a bigger distance, although not to such a great extent. On the other hand, the lack of noise and the excellent color rendition are admirable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone shoots videos in MP4 format in a 352 × 288 pixels resolution. In addition, it is possible to set a lower, standard resolution as well as a 3GP format. All taken picture and shot videos are gathered in a rotating gallery. When you view pictures, their previews roll around the display. While rotating, you can select the one you wish to send or possibly view across the entire display. Although effective, this solution is somewhat slow. The reason is in the high resolution of the pictures, due to which they take longer to display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing the gallery in the open phone mode... ? ... and in the camera mode </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Entertainment does not mean camera only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Beside the camera, the phone offers entertainment in the form of a multimedia files player. It is the old good Real Player. It plays MP3 and AAC formats and plenty of other sound and video formats. If you take into account the equipment of old Nokia Symbian phones, the stereophonic sound of the new model will definitely please you. You should not worry about running across memory space difficulties. Beside the inner memory of 31 MB, you are also provided a memory card slot of the RS-MMC type. It works at both 1.8V and 3.0V, and is therefore compatible with all kinds of RS-MMC memory cards. Supplied with the phone is a card of 64 MB.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Along with the phone comes a pair of standard earphones, which are the same as the earphones of Nokia 6681, 6630 and many other models. Due to the built-in microphone they can be used as a light handsfree set too. They are plugged into the system connector. The sound quality is identical to the one of other Nokia models. I mean, it is reasonable and fully sufficient for travel needs. Regrettably, N90 does not have a radio.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you stop enjoying taking pictures or listening to music, enter the game world. Nokia N90 has two preinstalled games - the old good snake in a modern version and a card game, but according to your wish you can always install a huge amount of additional higher-quality games thanks to Symbian.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Data communication is best supported by WCDMA 3G network. Nokia N90 can also send data through the packet technology GPRS as well as through the much faster EDGE with both of them being of Class 10. Communication with the closest environment is guaranteed by Bluetooth or by a USB cable, which is a part of the phone's delivery package. N90 does not have infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the delivery box you will also find a CD with the latest version of PC Suite. Once again, everything is the same. Connecting the phone to the computer is an instant operation, which can be managed by everybody - incl. complete beginners - thanks to the attached detailed user's guide. The process of synchronization with Outlook is fast and smooth. I even used the phone as a modem through both cable and Bluetooth connection for a little while. As I had expected, it ran smoothly. What I am not able to estimate yet is what the connection stability may be, if the connection lasts longer.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Another function to be found in the phone is called Data Transfers. It allows mass transfers of records from the phonebook and the calendar as well as creating a gallery between two Symbian phones connected through Bluetooth, which is quite a practical extra function.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>N90 offers a web/WAP browser. It is relatively good quality. It manages even some relatively complicated pages. N90 also offers the tried out Opera in case that you are not satisfied with the standard browser.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>For those adoring beauty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia's idea has proved to be successful. The new N90 model is a remarkable phone. Although it is very expensive, it will definitely gain fans in a short time. Even more important than the adored 2 megapixel camera is the main display. We expect that it will soon appear in other new models with Symbian operational system. The most notable disadvantages of N90 are its size and weight. Beside the price, these two characteristics may stop many people from buying the phone. Yet, there are many aspects in which they fade in front of N90's excellent construction and rich equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is expected to appear in most of the shops in Europe in mid August, the latest. Its price is estimated at about 670 euros. For the moment, Nokia's strategy in respect to prices is not clear. We do not know whether it is planning to keep them high within the N series as it did with its luxurious stylish phones. We suppose, however, that their price will be gradually falling for what is considered to be high-class equipment today is going to be a common standard in a few years. In the case of Nokia N90, however, this process will probably take longer.</paragraph>
