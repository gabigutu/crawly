			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Odyssey for Verizon Wireless is the manufacturer's only Windows Phone 8 handset on offer in the United States - not exactly an all-out effort by any standard. The Korean giant decided not to bring the Galaxy S III resembling Samsung Ativ S to Microsoft's vital home market in order to keep all the consumer attention pinned to its successful Android flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite looking somewhat similar to its globally available sibling at a first glance, the Samsung Ativ Odyssey is significantly less equipped than the Ativ S. The LTE device is powered by the same 1.5GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 CPU, but features a smaller display with lesser resolution, inferior camera unit, and less built-in memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the full list of talents which the Samsung Ativ Odyssey has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a Windows Phone 8 realm where processing power is relatively equal across the board, the Samsung Ativ Odyssey manages to stand out from among its peers with two major qualities. First, the handset offers unmatched compactness and one-handed ergonomics, thanks to its 4" display. Also, with a user-replaceable 2100mAh battery, the device offers the biggest battery available on a WP8 smartphone in the United States.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as specs go, we were mostly puzzled by seeing the Ativ Odyssey use the well familiar 4" WVGA PenTile Super AMOLED screen. This particular display unit has been featured in a massive number of Samsung devices but today, three years after its introduction, it doesn't feel (or look) cutting edge even by today's WP8 low-tier standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, does the Samsung Ativ Odyssey deserve a spot in the US Windows Phone 8 landscape, currently dominated by Nokia and HTC? Read on to find out! As always, we are going to kick the handset's review off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include some of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our home office and test lab. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package at the bare minimum<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Odyssey comes in a small, Verizon branded retail box. Inside it, you will find a charger and a USB cable to go with the usual set of booklets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, headphones are omitted from the retail boxes of most carrier-branded smartphones in the US and the Samsung Ativ Odyssey is no exception. You will need to get a pair on your own dime.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Odyssey is hardly a looker due to the relatively large bezels around its already small display. On the front, it looks like the Samsung Focus 2 for AT&amp;T, while the back of the device resembles a shrunken Samsung Ativ S. The Ativ S however appears a lot more elegant due to its longer body, while the Ativ Odyssey it like a chubbier sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have the handset in any color, as long as it is Titanium Gray - the same hue, which graces every top shelf offering from Samsung ever since the Galaxy S III was introduced in 2012.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Build quality is rather good as usual for a Samsung handset. The Hyperglaze coated plastic body is certainly up to plenty of abuse, and so is the Gorilla Glass 2 covered display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The measures of the Samsung Ativ Odyssey are 122.4 x 63.8 x 10.9 mm, while its weight tips the scale at 125 grams. Save for its considerable thickness, the handset looks and feels extremely compact due to moderate screen size of only 4 inches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ativ Odyssey's 4" WVGA Super AMOLED display should be familiar to anyone who has taken a remote interest in Samsung's smartphone lineup over the past three years. With its infinite blacks, vivid colors, and superb contrast, the screen complements the Metro UI of Windows Phone 8 perfectly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, with a PenTile matrix on board, the display doesn't look as sharp as those on the current trend-setters. You can easily discern the individil pixels with your bare eyes - especially when reading a small-font text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, you will find the earpiece, the front-facing camera, as well as the ambient light and proximity sensors. A Verizon logo is keeping them company. Below the display is where the usual trio of capacitive key for navigating through WP8 are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker and microSD card clot are located on the left side of the Samsung Ativ Odyssey. The power/lock key and dedicated camera button are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is on top of the device. A secondary microphone for active noise cancelling keeps it company. The microUSB port and the mouthpiece are located on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP camera with its single LED flash are located on the top of the device's back. The loudspeaker is on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover, you will find the 2100mAh battery, as well as the microSIM card slot. No surprises here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The beefy battery, combined with the small and energy efficient display found in the Samsung Ativ Odyssey helped the handset achieve the whopping endurance rating of 57. This means that the handset will soldier through well over two full days if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing and video playback daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Samsung Ativ Odyssey is a pleasure. The 4" display allows for seamless one-handed operation, while the thick body of the handset actually makes it feel reassuring against unwanted drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the Windows Phone 8 experience which the Samsung Ativ Odyssey has to offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone 8 holds no surprises<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Odyssey boots Microsoft's latest Windows Phone 8. Here goes a video demo of the device in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A push on the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. If you push the volume rocker (either + or -) you can bring the sound switch and music controls on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device and reveals the live-tile Metro user interface. It's a vertical grid of Live tiles, which can be reordered the way you like. Almost anything can be placed in the grid by tapping and holding down over an app and selecting the Pin to start option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 introduces resizable live tiles, an option also available with the latest WP 7.8 update. When you tap and hold on a tile, you'll get additional resize button to the unpin one. You can witch between quarter, normal and double size. If you select the smallest one though, the tile will be just a static icon (as is in the regular menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks exactly the same - there is no wallpaper, you can just choose between dark (black) and light (gray) background colors. Whatever you choose it will be the base color for every system app within the Windows Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of the Live tiles display relevant info such as the current date, pending calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more (third party apps do it too). The Marketplace tile displays the number of updates available, while the Pictures tile is essentially a slideshow of your photos. It's nice to have all that info always available at-a-glance. You can look at them as homescreen widgets of sorts, but that's a bit oversimplifying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP8 offers multi-tasking as promised. It's not true multitasking always; most of the cases things are being done the iOS way. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them. But just like the iOS, if an app requires to run in the background (navigation clients, players, communicators, etc.) it can. The WP offers both kind of multi-tasking and it's up to developers to choose how their apps operate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-tasking interface is the same as in WP7 - to switch between apps you press and hold the Back key. You'll get thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to your running or suspended app. You can't "kill" any of those apps from here - to exit one you must bring it to front and use the Back key to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu displays two sets of options: like on the start screen, you can swipe between System and Applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Application settings let you configure each app you have on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 also can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OS ecosystems are doing it too - Android's got Google Voice, Apple has Siri and there are a number of third party "virtual voice assistants" available. The Windows assistant though is still far behind the competition though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features brought by WP8 is the Kids corner. You can select the apps and the types of media content that goes in and password-protect it, so you can safely share your smartphone with your kids without worrying that they will mess up your settings or access inappropriate content. When activated, the Kids corner is accessible by swiping left of the lockscreen. If you ensured it with a password your kids won't be able to return to your standard lock and home screen without that precious password.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub is a great phone/social book<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People Hub remains untouched. The first tab shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends - everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the entire alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last, and they can be displayed as "First Last" or "Last, First" (the two settings are separate), you can also filter contacts by choosing which services are used to make the list of your contacts (so you can hide Twitter contacts, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side brings you to the What's new tab that shows new events from all contacts in social networks. Another swipe shows the recent contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Rooms and Groups. Groups is a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too. Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rooms is just chat rooms similar with the Skype group chats, but with contacts from your phonebook and social accounts. You can pin them to Start as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations (there's more location goodness coming on later). You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, still not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much of the functionality available when viewing the list of all contacts is there when viewing a single photo. Below the contact's photo and their latest SNS update, there are actions - "call mobile", "text mobile", "write on wall", "view website" and so on. Below each action, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the What's new tab, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The History tab displays the complete history of exchange with a contact in one place, listed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phone app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets - a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the Microsoft's TellMe did well in recognizing our commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, the contact's photo will appear full screen and for you to slide up and reveal the call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A side note - status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap at the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging department is excellent in Windows Phone. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech balloons and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are placed only when the conversation moves to a different platform so it's not cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which platform to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the OS (but its availability is dependent on your plan and the carrier). It works as you would expect, by letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 offers a unified inbox for email, a feature introduced with 7.5. You can link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation view works fine - it lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It's the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. You can't swipe between the messages though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them as read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more. Finally, you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone is limited to the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes - that's it. The layout remains the same across all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions. Luckily, Windows Phone 8 has way more supported languages than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos (previously known as Pictures) hub is also pretty much the same as we left it in Windows phone 7.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. New functionality allows apps to integrate into the Photos hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Developers need to enable that into apps however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Photos hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums feature the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't assign individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends or closed ones so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Photos hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll unifies your entire collection of photos and videos, taken with the device, in a grid of 4x5. You cannot change the view of the camera roll. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or pinch to zoom. We appreciate that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook or the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music + Videos tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which now bears the Xbox logo or the last played media thumbnail. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported) or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when synching with Zune. The third section is podcasts where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music has a simple and straightforward interface. You won't have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger - you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings along a slight change in design to the now playing screen. The favorite, repeat and shuffle buttons are now placed horizontally next to the album cover instead of hidden behind it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no FM radio though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a music player, it's pretty standard - your tracks are sorted by artist, album, playlists or you can view all songs. The interface is very similar to that of the stock music player, but under the album art it lists the next three songs to be played - really helpful if you're using shuffle. There's no way to manually reorder the upcoming songs, but you can reshuffle them if there's one you don't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Music + Videos hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a time scroll and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in Windows Phone 8 has greatly improved codec support since our last encounter. Now it does recognize pretty much every Xvid, DivX and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using AC3 audio codec. While this is not perfect, it's much better than before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no subtitle support just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Windows Phone 8 is Zune independent, you can easily upload videos from your computer via the USB mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen - like a song or video</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Reasonably good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Odyssey audio output is hardly the loudest around, but the quality of the sound produced by the smartphone is reasonably good. We've seen better out there, but not too-demanding audiophiles should be fine with this performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problems we spotted were the above average intermodulation distortion in both tested scenarios and the higher than average stereo crosstalk when you connect a pair of headphones. Other than that the readings were great, which combined with the average volume levels adds up to a decent overall score.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the numbers and see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 5 megapixel camera we are familiar with<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Odyssey features a 5MP camera which, like its display, has been featured in quite a few smartphones made by the Korean manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple - you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness, ISO and more. You have a dedicated Macro focus mode but no face detection. The flash can be set to auto, forced or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera key will wake the phone with a single press - that is unlocking it, and start taking shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Odyssey may only snap 5MP stills, but the photos it produces are actually surprisingly good. The resolved detail is high even at 1:1 pixel level, the noise is low and the colors are usually spot on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can only change the white balance and the video resolution though. The LED works fine as a video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Odyssey may not offer much in terms of megapixel count, but it captures some nice 1080p videos to make up for that. They come with the same highly-detailed, nice and contrasty look that we saw in the still camera section and top it off with a smooth framerate and a bitrate of almost 20Mbits. On the downside, the sound recorded along the videos is single-channel only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared an untouched video sample from the Ativ Odyssey camera for direct download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a lengthy video uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Ativ Odyssey has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support to go with CDMA/EV-DO support. Naturally, Verizon's superb LTE network connectivity is on board as well, and a joy to use as always.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and hotspot, and stereo Bluetooth 3.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite you can still sync with Zune, your device is now Zune independent. There is Mass Storage mode for both the memory card and the internal phone storage and you can upload files on both. There is no requirement where you put your files (specific folders, etc.). If the phone has the appropriate app to recognize a file, you'll have access to it. Since there is no WP file manager, you'll have to access the unrecognizable files only via a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone knows music and video, as well as pictures and documents. But if you have let's say a ZIP or a RAR file, you won't be able to attach it in emails, because there is no file manager and there is no app to recognize this file and list it in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to your phone + SD storage you also get at least 7GB of SkyDrive cloud space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Ativ Odyssey also has NFC connectivity.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer gets more powerful, keeps the old looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone 8 brings got a major upgrade, but it kept its old looks. Almost everything Microsoft has done on the IE is under the hood and the end result is close to excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just don't expect Flash support, there is none and Adobe has officially abandoned the mobile browsers. Silverlight doesn't work either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the URL bar is always visible at the bottom of the screen (but the status bar at the top of the screen is auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button. You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options - tabbed browsing, recent history, favorites, share options, pin to Start, find on page and advanced settings..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar, which is a handy shortcut for looking things up if you're not sure which site exactly will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is quite minimalist - you have only the URL bar at the bottom with a reload icon to the left. Swiping the bar upward reveals shortcuts for tabs, recent, favorites, add to favorites, share page, pin to start and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history and it does offer to choose a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone 8 browser is certainly a capable performer, and uses hardware graphics acceleration to provide smoother graphics and animations. It topped our SunSpider benchmark charts, but scored somewhat above average on BrowserMark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bing search is here to stay<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you search on Bing, one of the things that might be offered as a relevant result is an app from the Marketplace. For example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also offers song recognition and barcode scanner. The new feature here is Local Scout. Thanks to the dedicated app and its provided service, you can search for various points of interest near your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera scanner can also snap a photo of text, perform OCR and translate it into another language.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, Bing does regular web searches for pages or images and can look for interesting locations nearby.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Store is still playing catch up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Marketplace, from now on called Store, is still playing catch up with the Apple Appstore and the Android Market. The number of apps available in there is higher than 100 000, but it's far less impressive than the Android and iOS. Since the Windows Phone 8 is different than its predecessor, it means the apps written on its native code won't work on the older versions. Bummer, right?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thankfully, all of the older apps will be compatible with the new WP8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized into three main sections - applications, games and music. A fourth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update - there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it's on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Xbox (previously known as Zune) Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too - new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song (or download it DRM-protected), just like you would on a Zune player (it's 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the try option, which is available to many games and apps. It gives you a trial of a game before you decide to buy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections - games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE tile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests - which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there's a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live - the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also from here you can see your friends and their profiles, achievements and avatars. There are a few shortcuts to other Xbox Live-related apps - such as remote Xbox control (like the Marketplace) or the app allowing you to change your avatar. If you don't have them installed, you'll be redirected to the Marketplace, otherwise you'll get directly to the app in question.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps is onboard, there is still no sign of navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic mapping solution in Windows Phone is Bing Maps. They have driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free, but they're not a match for Nokia's bespoke applications (we'll discuss them in the next section).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not quite voice-guided navigation. Here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that make reading easy. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though, it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Local Scout is now a separate app from the Maps. It will locate nearby points of interest with the new feature called Local Scout and it will even show you indoor maps of malls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from a "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool functionality of Local scout is you can pin places to your homescreen. So let's say you like a pub and like to check it out from time to time, read reviews, call for a reservation - it's right there on your homescreen - that's neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no pre-installed navigation software as expected, but we guess it's just because we got a pre-release unit and not the final one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great looking office suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. SkyDrive integration is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Places tab - this lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through email or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections - Documents, Places and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's look at the two most important apps - Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub got better too - it grew the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PowerPoint files will thrive in the Documents section too - but they are for viewing only, you can't edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you'd need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft's fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors. Still the innovation that Mango has brought to Windows Phone Office is great and shows Microsoft is dedicated to improving the Office experience further.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is very simple to use. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone provides users with the basics in smartphone organizing but should you need anything more the Marketplace is there too - it offers apps for just about everything - most of which are free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are left with the exact same feelings towards the Samsung Ativ Odyssey as we had towards the last year's Samsung Focus 2 for AT&amp;T. The handset looks hastily designed and executed in order to be able to play along with its rivals without grabbing too much attention. Samsung is doing great in the Android field and looks like it doesn't really want to bother with taking the spotlight away from its Google OS equipped offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What sets the handset apart from the crowd is its compact size - it is smaller than any of its rivals, thus easier to operate single handedly. The massive, user-replaceable battery is another strong feature of the smartphone - it offers the best longevity from any WP8 device we've tested. Performance and user experience are on par with the best in the WP8 realm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device's camera is surprisingly capable despite being with a somewhat low megapixel count. Plus, it offers smooth 1080p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is hardly cutting edge these days. It offers remarkable contrast and deep blacks, but the PenTile matrix somewhat compromises the experience by bringing questionable sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone's design is not quite innovative as well - it won't help it stand out in any way in a store, full of HTC and Nokia offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Priced at $49.99 with a two-year commitment to Verizon Wireless, the Samsung Ativ Odyssey is not exactly dirt-cheap either. It will set you back as much as any of its competitors which doesn't bode well for its overall prospects. You can pick up a Nokia Lumia 920 and HTC Windows Phone 8X for less than $100. Both will offer you instantly better overall user experience without the removable battery. We would still believe that both devices are worth the compromise though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Windows Phone 8X &#x2022; Nokia Lumia 920</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mid-range Nokia trio which consists of the Lumia 820, Lumia 822, and Lumia 810 is also more appealing than the Ativ Odyssey with a better display and camera on board. Each of the three devices also offers removable battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia Lumia 820 &#x2022; Nokia Lumia 810 &#x2022; Nokia Lumia 822</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Without the marketing budget of its Android siblings, the Samsung Ativ Odyssey clearly has a difficult task ahead of itself. Thankfully for its maker, unlike in the case of its rivals from Nokia, the fate of the company does not depend on its market success.</paragraph>
