			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the smartphone market driven towards equilibrium, tablets will be the new battleground. The Apple iPad Air and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 emerge as the archrivals in the 10-inch category, marching towards their inevitable clash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Casual browsing and gaming have long been the strong suit of tablets, but in the post-PC era they have a big issue to deal with - content creation. The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 addresses this with the S Pen stylus and a number of productivity apps linked to it, while Apple keeps pushing ease-of-use and unmatched user experience as the biggest advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how these two tablets stack up against each other.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Simple spec by spec comparisons like this don't usually tell the whole story - this article would've been much shorter if they did. Instead, we'll be looking at the two contenders from a use-case point of view - which one is best for a specific task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously, we'll need to start with the basics like how good the hardware is, will the battery last you the full work day and so on. And things will only get more focused after that. Which tablet is best for multimedia consumption? What about gaming? Which one will give you the most in terms of productivity? Are the cameras just decorations or actually usable?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already dealt with these things to a degree. The S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 fills the void left by the lack of a mouse - yes, tablets are all about touch but computer mice have long provided us with accuracy and additional control options that fingers just don't have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple killed the stylus in the first place and is not about to bring it back. Instead, Cupertino offers a first-rate experience within its own ecosystem. Office suite, maps, cloud, even music creation, all Apple made. Samsung on the other hand outsources much of that to Google, Polaris Office, Dropbox and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first round will be fought over hardware - the build, the looks, the good and the bad - right on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tablet design by its very nature is defined first and foremost by the screen and here the two tablets seem fundamentally different. Apple sticks to the original 9.7" screen of 4:3 aspect ratio, while Samsung uses the common 16:10 10.1" screen format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the two tablets are aren't that different in size - the Apple iPad Air measures 240 x 169.5 x 7.5, while the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is a bit bigger on the sides, 243.1 x 171.4 x 7.9 mm. Thin, iPad mini-like bezels is what allowed Apple to make the square-ish screen fit into the body of a widescreen tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in screens is nonetheless profound, and it will be properly covered in the next chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screens aside, the two tablets differ in something as simple as orientation - the button and front-facing camera placement of the iPad Air favor portrait usage, while those of the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 lean towards landscape. Obviously you can use both tablets either way, but you'll find yourself sticking to the manufacturer-suggested orientation most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest, we prefer on-screen buttons on tablets as they offer more flexibility and rotate with the rest of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the wide-screen Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 shows its multimedia nature with two loudspeakers positioned on the left and right side of the tablet. This creates a a more immersive audio experience than the stereo speakers on the iPad Air, which are both located at the bottom (or rather on the side as you'll be watching videos in landscape orientation). The Samsung tablet also pulls ahead with audio enhancements from SoundAlive and Adapt Sound technologies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multimedia aspect is also seen in the addition of a microSD card slot. Sure, you can get a 128GB iPad Air, while the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 tops out at 64GB of built-in storage, but let's be honest- a 128GB Air costs an insane amount of money. 64GB microSD cards are around $50 a pop, so a 16GB Note 10.1 2014 is still an option for heavy multimedia consumers. A cheap option at that, Apple charges a $100 premium every time the built-in storage doubles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera on the iPad Air is in the middle of one of its short sides, similar to the placement on the iPhone. This is good for one-on-one video chatting and selfies. The camera on the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is positioned near the middle of one of its long sides, which fits the widescreen better with multiple people involved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while you're holding the Note 10.1 2014 horizontally, you'll notice the IR blaster at the top. It can control home equipment like TVs, disc players and set top boxes, placing it in charge of your home theater setup. At the very least, you have the option to change the channel if you're on the tablet while the TV runs in the background, a scenario that is probably well familiar to most users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the connectivity side, Apple uses the proprietary Lightning adapter, which can be plugged in regardless of the orientation. However, microUSB cables are far more common than Lightning cables, which you'll feel instantly if you need to borrow a cable. They are also much cheaper if you need to get a second one for the office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air connector boasts TV Out functionality, though you'd need an adapter. Still, it's a great option to have - either for watching movies or for doing presentations. The upside of the Note 10.1 2014's microUSB port is that you can plug in peripherals like external storage, keyboards and mice if you get a USB OTG cable (those are quite cheap and easy to find). With the proper adapter you can get HDMI out too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of connectivity, both tablets come in either Wi-Fi only or 4G LTE versions. The Apple iPad Air has only one 4G LTE version, which covers 3G UMTS, CDMA and 4G LTE. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 comes in 3G (powered by a Samsung Exynos chipset) and 4G (powered by Snapdragon 800). Note that the 4G LTE on the Samsung is Cat. 4, which offers downlink speeds of up to 150Mbsp, over the Cat. 3 of the iPad, which tops out at 100Mbps. But neither Note 10.1 2014 version has CDMA connectivity, which limits the choice of carriers for North American users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple's iPads have always had aluminum unibodies, but the one on the iPad Air is the best yet, by far. It's the slimmest too (iPad 3 and 4 were thicker than 2, Air is thinner than 2) and noticeably lighter. The thinner side bezels help a great deal in handling the tablet, but it's still a two-hand device. Then again, so is the Note 10.1 2014. Anyway, the aluminum design of the iPad Air is attractive and isn't out of place anywhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's designs are best known for their glossy plastic but the 2014 edition of the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, just like the Galaxy Note 3, has a faux-leather back. It feels reasonably close to leather to the touch and looks pretty attractive. Less subjectively, the textured plastic feels warmer and offers more grip than the naked metal of the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. It was close, but the Note 10.1 2014 is more flexible in terms of storage, has better connectivity (unless you're a Verizon or Sprint user), including an IR blaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some will prefer the metal looks of the Apple iPad Air and maybe value wired TV-Out over cheap storage. North American users also have to consider the CDMA support, unless they're looking for a Wi-Fi tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air has a 9.7" IPS LCD with a resolution of 2,048 x 1,536 pixels, which works out to 264ppi. It's covered by scratch-resistant glass with oleophobic coating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 has 10.1" Super Clear LCD of 2,560 x 1,600 resolution for a higher 299ppi. There's no mention of scratch-resistance though. It does have an additional digitizer, which is used with the S Pen - it can detect it from several inches away and will detect presses of the S Pen's button, even though the stylus doesn't have a battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'd think that because the Note 10.1 2014 screen has a 0.4" bigger diagonal, the Samsung tablet has an advantage in screen real estate. Due to the different aspect, however, that's not the case - the difference is negligible, around 1%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not always the case though, sometimes how much of the screen is actually used depends on the content. Most photos, for example, have a 4:3 aspect, matching the iPad perfectly. Recently, many cameras default to 16:9 though, which would fit the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 better. Same goes for most video content, which is 16:9, even movies you got from mobile-centric video stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 4:3 screen is better suited for text and documents - an A4 page is pretty close to a 4:3 aspect ratio. Even web pages mostly have relatively narrow columns, which fit portrait screens quite well - in this orientation, the iPad Air screen is wider than the Note 10.1 2014's giving you the opportunity to zoom in closer and get bigger text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the high pixel density makes it impossible to see individual pixels, the pixels on the iPad Air screen and the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 screen are quite different when viewed under a microscope. The iPad has a standard RGB matrix, while the Galaxy tablet has an RGBW matrix, which should in theory improve brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results show the reality is quite the opposite, however, the iPad Air is brighter than the Note 10.1 2014 and has better contrast across the brightness range. Black levels go from equal at full blast, to noticeably better for the iPad as the brightness goes down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles are excellent for both tablets and color reproduction is very pleasing. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 has a slight edge here with the proprietary Screen mode option. It gives you three options to adjust the color profile of the screen (it changes saturation and white balance), plus an automatic mode, which adjusts the screen based on the current image or video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not as flexible as the Nokia Lumia color profile, which has not one but two sliders - one for saturation and another for white balance - but it's better than nothing. Apple uses multiple suppliers for its screens, so getting a warm or a cold screen is a matter of luck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Widescreen has conquered everything from phones through tablets and laptops all the way to large TVs, so most content targets that aspect. The higher pixel density (even with the unusual matrix) and the adjustable screen modes are enough to put the Note 10.1 in pole position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air however has a slightly brighter screen with a better contrast, plus the 4:3 aspect ratio is good for text, so it's up to personal preference here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two tablets are powered by sealed Li-Po batteries of similar capacity. The Apple iPad Air has a slight advantage with its 8,820mAh battery, while the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 has a 8,220mAh juice pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the Galaxy tablet screen is a bit brighter than the iPad Air when both are set at 50% brightness (which is what we use for the test). Even so, the advantage of the iPad is more than can be explained with simple brightness alone. There's that extra 600mAh, but that's insignificant compared to the total.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing over Wi-Fi drains the battery quite slowly, the iPad Air lasted over 10 hours of that. The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 failed to crack 8 hours. That's a good 30% advantage for the Apple tablet in such a key area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The margin grows in the video playback test, with the Apple iPad Air almost reaching 13 hours, while the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 gave up after 9 hours. Granted, the Note 10.1's screen is better suited for widescreen video, but 4 hours is a massive difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put things in perspective, if both tablets start playback at the same time at full charge, the iPad will still have over 30% left in the tank by the time the Note 10.1 dies.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We suspect the custom designed chipset by Apple and the brand new screen backlight (using just 36 LEDs instead of 84 on the iPad 4) are very much to thank for the excellent results. We'll see later on if the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 can compensate with better performance of its Snapdragon 800 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Apple iPad Air. This was a walkover for the iPad. The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 has decent battery life, but the iPad will consistently outlast it in similar workloads.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of a tablet can greatly affect the user experience. Since both Apple and Samsung have overwhelming presence on the market, you probably have at least passing familiarity with both UIs. Still, here are a couple of hands-on videos to refresh your memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to be said about the iPad Air - the focus is on one app at a time, though the notification area and quick toggles show some additional info and allow basic control over the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four finger gesture that moves between apps is not the most comfortable, but it's quicker than going through the app switcher if you need to move between apps often. The system-wide swipe left for Back is another nice though not very comfy trick (it works better on the iPhone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz interface on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is quite the opposite - it has two separate ways to multitask that can co-exist for even more multi-app action. One is the split-screen option called Multi Window - half of the 10.1" screen is about the same surface area as a 7" screen, so usability really isn't hampered in any way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other option is the Pen Window option that allows you to launch floating mini apps that can be resized and minimized so that they're out of the way, but always accessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one downside of Multi Window and Pen Window is that only supported apps can be used in those modes. Still, the basics like the web browser, email and chat are covered and there are a growing number of apps in the Play Store that do support Samsung's proprietary API.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android's widget system - both on the homescreen and on the lockscreen - is a lot more powerful and flexible in terms of at a glance information delivery. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 comes with a great set of widgets that cover everything from news and stocks, through email and notes to Dropbox and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 also comes with a dedicated homescreen page that serves as both a news reader and a way to stay up to date with social networking updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri is available on the iPad Air. It's there to answer quick questions, perform basic tasks (e.g. set reminders and alarms) and do voice dictations. The Note 10.1 has S Voice as its default assistant with similar functionality, but also Google Now, which is great at anticipating what info you need. The best thing about Google Now is that it requires no user interaction to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another important difference between the two tablets is their respective cloud backups. Apple uses its own iCloud service that syncs all the basics (contacts, Keychain, photos and so on), plus app info, so apps will retain their settings and files even if you've uninstalled them for months. All of this goes into 5GB of free storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Cloud service syncs your phonebook and calendar, browser settings, plus your Scrapbook. You can link a Dropbox account to sync your pictures, videos and documents. Samsung throws in 50GB of Dropbox storage for free for two years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple also has a nifty Do Not Disturb (DND) feature that mutes all notifications except for messages and calls from a select group of people. This is great for both school and meetings as the tablet will keep quite unless there's an important message you need to answer immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. Some people don't like TouchWiz much, but it's undeniable that it's very functional and has a high degree of customization. Heavy multitaskers will really appreciate Multi Window and Pen Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air interface is nice, but it plays out exactly like that of the iPhone and the much larger screen begs for some extra options.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even low-end phones are getting to the point of "good enough" performance, but we're not looking for that here - we want leading processing power from the Apple iPad Air and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 as they're going to have to runs some complicated apps, not to mention the latest 3D games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two run on completely different platforms. The iPad Air has Apple's custom A7 chipset based on the new ARMv8 architecture. The specs sound misleadingly modest - a dual-core CPU at 1.3GHz. The GPU is from the latest PowerVR series from Imagination, Apple's usual GPU partner. The tablet makes do with just 1GB RAM, but limited RAM has never proven to be an issue for iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 comes in two versions. One uses the Snapdragon 800 chipset that's ubiquitous on the Android high-end. It has four Krait 400 cores clocked at 2.3GHz an Adreno 330 GPU designed by Qualcomm itself. The other option is Samsung's Exynos chipset with four Cortex-A15 cores (and four power-saving Cortex-A7s) plus a Mali-T628MP6 GPU, all designed by ARM. Both tablet versions have roomy 3GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that we're testing the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 with the Exynos chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, what do all those model numbers mean? It turns out that the processors of both tablets are virtually equal, despite the big core count and clock speed advantage of the Note 10.1. The Samsung tablet comes out ahead in Geekbench 3, while the Apple tablet wins in Linpack, so there might be small variations depending on the exact workload but devs generally have the same amount of horsepower to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since these tablets will be running full blown Office suites and other complicated apps (like, CAD apps), all that oomph is there to ensure smooth operation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even serious business people will have to admit that gaming makes up a big part of a tablet's usage. We ran off-screen test with GLBenchmark and found out the iPad has slightly more 3D rendering power than the Note 10.1 This is bad news for the Galaxy tablet as it has a higher resolution screen. Apple have always been ahead in terms of GPU and things aren't changing here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X (off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3DMark - Ice Storm Unlimited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it's the on-screen tests that matter - 1080p is no longer an impressive resolution for a tablet and most games will run at native resolution (though some have an option to upscale from a lower internal resolution). Both tablets run GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt at playable framerate, but struggle with the newer 2.7 T-Rex. Benchmarks are always ahead of the curve, but it still shows iPad game devs have more room for graphics eye candy than Android game devs.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web also plays a huge role in our modern day lives and it's one of the primary reasons to get a tablet. Both fast JavaScript and good HTML5 rendering performance is needed for complicated web apps to run satisfactory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has a highly tuned JavaScript engine that outperforms Samsung's by some margin, despite the similar CPU performance. The lead only extends when the browser has to handle rendering complex web pages.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Apple iPad Air. It looked close for a moment, but the iPad Air leads in 3D and web performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not to say that there are tasks the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 can't handle. Still, if cutting edge performance is what you are after, the iPad is a nose ahead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps and productivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's start off with something as basic as messaging. Even phones don't do a lot of voice calls these days (even less when you count only ones on a mobile network), so powerful messaging is required of modern tablets, not having voice call functionality on a mobile network is no excuse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messaging comes in a lot of forms and the most basic one is text messaging (obviously we're not talking SMS here). Both tablets push their own brand of messaging - the Apple iPad Air has iMessage, while the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 has ChatON. Google's Hangouts is available out of the box too (there's a capable iOS version as well).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android and iOS can both do voice dictation instead of regular text input, but the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 can also handle handwriting recognition using the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both iMessage and ChatON have versions for phones and for desktop computers. The iMessage app is Mac OS-only though, while ChatON is available as a web app that can be accessed from any platform. Neither app does VOIP calls, but Hangouts on iOS can (surprisingly, Hangouts on Android is yet to get there).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both clients can send photos, but ChatON tries to go a bit further with animated stamps (they are becoming the hot new thing) and serves as a mini social network too - you can post updates and follow people. That said, Hangouts will probably see more use than ChatON.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's video chatting, which Hangouts does out of the box (including group video chatting). The iPad Air has its own out of the box solution for video chats - Facetime - though it's mano-a-mano and there's no Facetime client for Android (but again, there's a Hangouts app for iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's good ol' email. On the iPad, it's handled by the Mail app, which has a split-screen interface for navigating between different messages. A similar interface is also available on both mail apps on the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, Gmail and Mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail has handy gestures and automatically organizes messages into categories (e.g. promotional emails are put in the same folder). The generic email app isn't as smart, but it still has nice features like dragging and dropping an email into a folder. You can also use the S Pen to preview messages by hovering over them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both tablets come with full Office suites out of the box. The iPad Air has Apple's iWorks suite, while the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 relies on Polaris Office. Both apps support viewing and editing Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs with powerful editing and formatting features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both apps also support wireless printing, but it's up to the printer to support the required format (AirPrint on both counts).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We covered the cloud sync support on both tablets, but Polaris Office has additional sync features, including Box.net, Dropbox, Google Drive or SugarSync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic organizational skills on both tablets are handled by calendar, notes and to-do apps that have mostly the same functionality. Both calendar apps can connect to multiple online calendars and will sync your notes to the cloud for backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 also has the S Note app, which leverages the S Pen to take notes by hand, which is much more convenient if you need to make a sketch. The S Note app also syncs with the popular Evernote service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Notes are created in a floating app interface, which makes them quick and unobtrusive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen can do yet more - each time you pull it out, the Air Command menu pops up. It provides way to access several features that rely on the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Action Memo, for example, is similar to S Note but elements of the memos can trigger action, e.g. a "Call Steve" memo can be set to dial Steve's number. Handwriting recognition is used to make this magic work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen can also quickly screenshot a part (or all) of the screen so that you can scribble on some comments on top (this can be invaluable to designers who need a way to provide quick feedback).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's S Search, which is the most powerful search tool we've seen yet. It searches through messages, multimedia, settings, phonebook, the internet and content created by the S Apps. You can tag items, restrict things by date of creation or content type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. The Note 10.1 really leans on its S Pen for some handy functionality, which really enhances the tablet experience. Samsung also preloaded the tablet with a host of home-baked apps and tweaks, which can be helpful to some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air does a great job too, though it doesn't really have features that aren't matched by the Note 10.1 (and it misses a few).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the hardware section we touched on the multimedia powers of the tablets, now it's time to expand on that and back it up with some concrete numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 brought a brand new gallery app with some cool new functionality. The default view is called Moments and groups photos by location and date, which makes finding the photos from your summer vacation a breeze. An alternative view shows you a map with pins indicating the locations of photos in your gallery. There's a mini social network in the form of Photo streams that allows you to share photos with friends and family on different topics (streams) and they can comment back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For photo and video editing, Apple has made iPhoto and iMovie free, both of which are fairly powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GarageBand is also free, the app allows music editing and creation. YouTubers and up and coming musicians will appreciate these options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is close to stock Android, though it has some enhancements. It can group photos by time or by location (but not both), by the people in them or by plain folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature here is that there's a panel that shows the folders on the left, similar to the Explorer app on Windows, which simplifies operations that span multiple folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For editing, you get the standard gallery photo editing tools plus a simple video editor. The bespoke Sketchbook app, however, will be of great interest to artists - it's a sketching app that makes full use of the S Pen, including pressure sensitivity. The app supports layers with blending modes, visual guides and symmetry tools. It turns the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 into a powerful tool for digital artists that can replace Photoshop and a Wacom tablet setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 10.1 doesn't have an answer to GarageBand though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's multimedia players are typically among the best and the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is no exception. The music player supports the most popular music formats - MP3, AAC and FLAC. An equalizer is available to enhance your listening experience, complete with SoundAlive presets like Tube amp effect and Virtual 7.1 channel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manual equalizer has a great option to pick a setting from a grid ranging from instrumental to vocal and from treble to bass, with Rock, Jazz, Classic and Pop squares labeled to give you a hind where to aim for a specific genre. A similar method can be used to automatically construct a playlist of a given mood and tempo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Better yet, you can let the Galaxy Note 10.1 do the work itself and adjust its settings automatically to your headphones with the Adapt Sound feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports Multi Window and Pen Window, so you can control it without leaving the current app. The standard lockscreen and notification area controls are there too. AllShare and DLNA are supported if you want to stream your music to something with more audio power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air music player is closely linked to Apple's iTunes store. The desktop app will handle file conversion if necessary, but MP3 and AAC should work. Also, if you're using iTunes Match, Apple will automatically provide high-quality versions of your songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also iTunes Radio for Internet streaming, which has 15 second ads. iTunes Match removes them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad music player has controls in the Control Center, so you can change tracks without leaving the app too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The situation with the video players is similar. The Galaxy Note 10.1 covers most of the popular formats (although it misses on a few that were available on previous Samsung products), while with the iPad everything goes through Apple - either their iTunes servers or the desktop app, so you don't even need to know what a video format is (but this might require transcoding).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Samsung video player has the same features as the music player, including SoundAlive and playback in a floating window. Not using the whole screen for video doesn't make sense for movies, but lectures, interviews, music videos all fit very well in a Pen Window app while you use another app. The YouTube app also supports Pen Window, so you can watch online videos the exact same way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned several times Apple's iTunes is the primary source of music and videos for your iPad. Google also sells music and videos through the Play Store, but Android is a lot more permissive about third-party stores so you can just as easily go to Amazon for your content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when you do download a movie to watch, you can watch it on your TV. The iPad Air offers wired TV-Out (requires an adapter) and wireless AirPlay (requires and Apple TV). There are apps to add DLNA support to the iPad too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 10.1 offers HDMI out via an adapter (those are much cheaper than the Apple TV) and wireless DLNA, which is supported by new HDTVs, so no adapters are needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 10.1 has the added advantage of the IR blaster on top, which means it can control AV receivers, disc players and set top boxes. It can be the heart of your home theater setup, whether or not you use it as the video source.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. It depends on what you need the tablet for, really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad has more content creation options, especially when it comes to music where Android is traditionally weak. It's better at organizing your photos too, though dealing with iTunes (the store and the desktop app) is pretty much mandatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is the best tablet for drawing and it does give you more freedom when it comes to playback with better codec support and more stores you can access. It's the better choice for a home theater setup too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Amazing audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition showed excellently clean audio output in our test and even managed to slightly outdo the iPad Air in terms of scores - it's the kind of difference that's within the acceptable testing error though and certainly not something that you can detect with your ears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you will be able to detect is the far higher volume levels on the Apple slate. While the Galaxy Note 10.1 isn't too bad, it's nowhere near the iPad Air standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Apple iPad Air frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Apple iPad Air. The output is equally clean on the two slates, but the higher volume levels clinch this one for the Apple slate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both tablets have stereo speakers but they are positioned differently, which makes a big difference. On the Apple iPad Air, both speakers are at the bottom, which is a sub-optima placement - they are close together (you lose the stereo effect) and they are aimed in the same direction (the sound goes off to one side when watching movies).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung placed the speakers on the left and right sides of the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. They are not like the speakers on the Nexus 10 or the HTC One, which face in the same direction as the screen though. Still, you get a better stereo effect and the speakers are more powerful to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. Better placement and louder sound make this a slam dunk.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We don't condone tablet photography, but both tablets can snap a photo or record a video in a pinch. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 has an advantage here - it has an 8MP camera to Apple iPad Air's 5MP shooter. The Samsung tablet also has an LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LTE version of the Note 10.1 can also record 1080p video at 60fps, while the non-LTE version and the iPad Air top out at 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, both cameras apps are cut down versions of those found in the flagship phones of their respective companies. This means the iPad camera is even more basic - you can snap regular photos with the front or back camera, square photos and record 1080p @ 30fps videos. There's HDR mode, AE/AF lock and geo-tagging (note that the Wi-Fi only iPads don't have GPS) as well as grids. There's no panorama mode or color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo Booth does give you a choice of 8 effects with live preview.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung camera app has a ton of features in comparison. For one, you can choose the resolution and adjust image properties. Geo-tagging with GPS is available on all Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are color effects with live preview, HDR mode, panorama plus a selection of the more advanced modes. There's object removal, Drama shot (creates several copies of a moving object), Sound &amp; shot (records ambient noise along with the photo, these are hard to share) and best photo mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 has an advantage in terms of image quality right out the gate due to its higher resolution, which actually translates in more detail rather than being just a number. Noise levels in the Apple iPad Air photos were higher too, which doesn't help its cause.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both tablets go for a warm white balance, with the iPad Air generally being closer to reality. Part of that is because the Samsung tablet tends to oversaturate colors. The iPad has a problem with reds though. The Air tries to keep detail in the shadows at the expense of the highlights, while the Note 10.1 takes a more balanced approach and loses bits in both the shadows and the highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad has a slightly wider field of view (FoV), which means it can fit more in the frame, but that comes at the cost of reduced resolved detail for each object.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to shooting videos, both tablets shoot 1080p videos at 30fps with 17Mbps bitrate. The iPad uses a slightly more advanced codec (AVC High@L4.1 over High@L4.0). The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 has an additional 1080p @ 60fps mode and can do 720p and lower if needed, while the iPad is stuck at 1080p @ 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of detail is comparable between the two tablets, but the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 has a slight edge in terms of sharpness. More importantly, the Note 10.1 has a wider FoV, which means it can fit a bit more in the frame. This is because the iPad has an always-on digital stabilization, which reduces the FoV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy also tones down the saturation in videos, which improves color accuracy. It also records stereo sound, while the iPad - like all iOS devices - just records mono sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the video samples we shot with both tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. A higher resolution camera with slightly better image quality and many more options, win the still camera for the Note 10.1. It also comes out on top for video recording with stereo sound and a 1080p @ 60fps option. Oh, and there's an LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air camera is at least a generation behind the Note 10.1 camera (which itself is behind current phones). Again, we think using a tablet's camera is a move of either desperation or cluelessness, so it's not a huge deal.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already knew, there's no tablet that's good at everything, but both the Apple iPad Air and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 have their shining moments. It's these advantages that will ultimately help users choose one or the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air certainly has simplicity on its side - we've read glowing reports of people who bought an iPad for an elder relative who used it without constantly asking about this or that. That simplicity comes back to bite the Air when it's in the hands of a power user - they quickly realize that it's just a large iPhone 5s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad Air</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have to wonder whether there would be room for the iPad to begin with, if Apple was more like the competition and had both a 5" iPhone and an iPhablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't get us wrong, it's a wonderful piece of hardware, thin and light, it has an excellent screen and perfectly optimized chipset. We really appreciated the first-party apps that handle Office documents, photos, videos and music creation. iPads have been popular among the music making crowd due to iOS's lower audio delay compared to Android. The Air also has an advantage in audio quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't mind Apple's walled garden mentality, the iPad Air works beautifully. The iCloud takes care of syncing, iMessage and Facetime are good at chatting, iTunes is one of the richest content stores, things like AirDrop and AirPlay add value if you have other Apple devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most importantly, the iPad Air has a huge advantage when it comes to number of apps specifically tailored to its large screen. So while apple didn't bother taking advantage of the extra estate, its partners grabbed the opportunity, giving the iPad what's certainly one of its most potent weapons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple's iron grip is too tight for some geeks though. The custom interface and features of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 can be overwhelming if you try to take it all in at once, but you don't have to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multitasking features are the most powerful this side of desktop Windows (and we don't mean Modern UI on Windows 8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the S Pen, however, that sets it apart from other tablets. The obvious use is for digital artists, who can't take their Wacom tablet and computer on the go. But it can also be good for CAD apps too - AutoDesk has several Android apps to handle things like viewing and editing AutoCAD files, doing calculations on complex designs, planning a home interior and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AutoCad 360 is available for iOS too, but the dedicated S Pen support makes it more intuitive and more accurate to use than aiming with your fingers. The S Pen also shines when you need to scribble a quick annotation or a note, as well as searching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 is also better at multimedia - it has better support out of the box, no restrictions for third-party app stores, it's TV-out functionality doesn't require pricy Apple dongles, it has an IR blaster to control additional media equipment. Couple that with the higher-res screen and better speakers, the Note 10.1 is better for watching videos on and off the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the many similarities between the two tablets, it seems that there's a clear dividing line between the Apple iPad Air and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. One can do the job of the other, of course, just not as well - but you wouldn't be paying this kind of cash for "good enough", not after reading this article would you?</paragraph>
