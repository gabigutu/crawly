			<paragraph>We've been all over ourselves into mobile phones, our job implies that. Come this time of the year though when everyone tries to get out of the box and find the best present for their loved ones, we get down to work to summarize all the latest and greatest in one single article that would hopefully help you find the right mobile phone for this year's Christmas shopping frenzy. In case you've decided to go for last year's top models, we've covered those as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>However if you are reading this article, odds are that you have already started checking on some of the hottest mobile phones this year. We are here to lend you a hand and present you some of the best picks for this holiday season. Before you are off buying online any of these phones, though, don't forget to have a look around your local shops - they might just have the deal for you at a special holiday price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This year we have tried keeping the categories to a minimum. Of course, these categories are purely theoretical since nowadays mobile phones are more and more universal multimedia devices. Don't be stomped by technology, if you are not exactly the tech buff type of person. But again, if you are not all interested in high tech stuff, we doubt you would be reading this guide anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we begin exploring this year's offerings, we'll take the time and explain you how we structured the whole thing. Each category has several main contenders. Usually they are best in their class. Since we've tried keeping their number down to a certain limit, some nice phones are inevitably left out. That is why every category has an additional list of handsets called: "Also to consider". Next we've made our own best pick selection in every category. And finally, we present you the last year's top models in every category to help you in your search for the best bargain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cameraphones continue to fascinate many people. This year they've crossed the 5 megapixel barrier en masse taking mobile phones closer to digital cameras than ever before. This also means that you don't have to break the bank to get yourself a decent cameraphone these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our main offerings however are several top-of-the-line cameraphones that won't fit into everybody's budget, but they represent the latest and greatest on the cameraphone market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N95 has been around for quite some time now. Its 8GB sibling brought some changes only to the camera speed. Both handsets are versatile smartphones and the camera is not their only main feature. However in terms of camera quality, the Nokia N95 and the 8GB version are second to none.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N82 was only recently announced but it's already available just in time for the holiday shopping. While we are still working on the N82 review, we can surely conclude that it's equal in camera quality to the N95. In fact the built-in xenon flash makes it even better. As we managed to verify, it's brighter even than the xenon flash used in Sony Ericsson Cyber-shot line-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia N95 (EUR 390) | review ? Nokia N82 (EUR 450) | preview </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 Viewty is another capable 5-megapixel cameraphone that has exciting features of its own. While being really good at taking pictures, its main focus is the 3-inch touchscreen TFT display and the whopping video recording capabilities. The LG Viewty is the only cameraphone to date capable of capturing video at 120 fps. That kind of framerate is great for making slow motion videos that show never before seen details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G800 is a healthy choice too if you really need camera-centric mobile phone. It's again an exceptional offering with its 3x optical zoom that allows you to get closer to the action. The sturdy built, the extensive camera settings and the great image quality make it a great product for any shutterbug on the go.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You should also consider?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You probably saw that the Sony Ericsson K850 is not on the top places of our list. Although a Cyber-shot cameraphone snatched our recommendation last year, we feel that this time the Sony Ericsson K850 is not on par with the other major contenders. While it sports wonderful camera interface and a wonderful xenon flash, the Sony Ericsson K850 simply doesn't cut it with image quality this year. All of our recent shootouts confirmed that the Sony Ericsson K850 is inferior in camera quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 is another 5 megapixel offering by the South Korean manufacturer. It's not their top cameraphone product but it's really popular since it's the most compact handsets of all 5-megapixels, and also it the least expensive one. It offers most of the advanced features that its brother has plus it has the most recent version of the Samsung handheld user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you are on a shorter budget, you also might want to have a look at Samsung E590, which is a mid-end 3-megapixel cameraphone by Samsung. It's designed by Jasper Morrison and thus has some really controversial looks. If that doesn't bother you that little nifty player has all the camera powers to keep you posting on Flickr day after day.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Last year's tops were?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While last year cameraphones are not the latest and greatest technology-wise however they are still good in image quality and you are most likely to find them at highly reduced prices at your local shops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All prices are strictly indicative. They are taken from various online resources and they do not include taxes or carrier subsidies. Your local street prices will probably differ.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Traditionally, Sony Ericsson Walkman phones are ruling the music-oriented mobile phones market. This year we saw the advent of the new generation of Walkman phones - we saw the Shake Control feature introduced for the first time and we saw an 8GB Walkman phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W910 is a really neat mobile phone - slim, well designed, stylish and it comes bundled with some exciting technology - the Shake Control. It allows you to control your music player with only a shake of your hand. Besides, the top-of-the line music player, the Sony Ericsson W910 also offers lightning fast response in all scenarios plus a great display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W960 is the flagship of the Walkman series with a large touchscreen display, Symbian OS, and probably the most enhanced Walkman music player currently. Oh, and did we mention the 8GB of storage space available to the user? Anyways, while we did a relatively unfavorable review on the Sony Ericsson W960 mainly because of its disappointing looks, that bloke is still a viable option when choosing a mobile phone/music player this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson W960 (EUR 470) | review ? Sony Ericsson W910 (EUR 275) | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having 8GB of storage space onboard is surely exciting for music fans, so a couple of other manufacturers threw in some of that magic into their handsets, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 8GB features plenty of storage for your tracks and videos. The unique touchscreen interface and the wonderful 3.5-inch 16M color TFT display make it a great music and video player without any doubt. It also sports Wi-Fi support and the greatest web browser on a mobile device to-date. The only downside we find with its usability is the iTunes synchronization program. It's the only way to upload content to the iPhone and this piece of software offers probably the worst user-friendliness levels we've seen lately. But let's not spoil the first impression of the Apple iPhone, it's a wonderful music player and a good mobile phone, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N81 is the next 8GB mobile phone that just might do the trick for you. While the previously mentioned cell phones are better at music reproduction quality, at least as far as our audio quality tests go, you won't find a recent Nokia mobile that sounds better than this baby. The Nokia N81 8GB offers a host of other multimedia features that would make listening to music and watching videos on the relatively big 2.4" 16M color display more enjoyable.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You should also consider?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's worth pointing out that all Samsung phones are great at music reproduction quality. It seems that the South Korean company is embedding the same high quality sound hardware in all of its mobiles - even the cheaper ones such as Samsung E200 or Samsung E250. So if you pick a Samsung offering for your next music mobile, you won't be making a mistake. Just make sure you listen to your music at the loudest volume level - it seems to be producing the best result with Samsung amplifiers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson also has a mid-tier offering that not only sound good, but also looks good, too. The Sony Ericsson W580 is a Walkman slider with a little something for the sports-minded user too. It features a slim profile, a nice display, and a pedometer, which will help you in your sports endeavors. It also has a calorie counter for storing all those calories burnt on the track.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Last year's tops were?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last year's music phone offerings probably won't offer today's cutting edge technology, but they are just as good in terms of audio quality plus they would probably cost a good deal less, so they deserve a look as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All prices are strictly indicative. They are taken from various online resources and they do not include taxes or carrier subsidies. Your local street prices will probably differ.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The list of the most fashionable handsets is harder to compile every year. It's simply because, they are so many gorgeous looking mobiles nowadays. But in order to fit in the fashionable category they have to be at least a bit more expensive than the regular mobile phones. Otherwise they wouldn't make the statement their owners are after. And we are not talking bling-bling; we are talking stylishness in its pure form.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 8GB has created tons of hype this year. It's pretty much the most sought after device currently on the mobile phones market. Everyone wants one, and the guys over at Apple have taken good care that not everyone can have one. This has subsequently created a black market niche for iPhones that reinstated it as a high status device in places where it's not officially sold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KE850 Prada was among the first mobile phones with large touch sensitive displays and fully touch based user interfaces. Adding the fashionable Prada brand to the equation and you are almost sure to have a high-class fashionable device with a fat price tag. The LG Prada is sleek, stylish and overpriced enough to make you rob the local bank in order to get it for Christmas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Apple iPhone 8GB (EUR 399) | review ? LG KE850 Prada (EUR 300) | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8600 Luna is another luxury device that can easily grab anyone's attention. With a fine stainless steel body and a smoked glass sliding cover it surely does look the part. The Nokia 8600 Luna is expensive however that makes it even more valuable as a fashion statement.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You should also consider?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is one other high-roller device that is still not available everywhere, but should be in the stores around Christmas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 8800 Arte was only recently announced however it should hit the stores by Christmas. The body of the Nokia 8800 Arte is again made by metal and glass much like the Nokia 8600 Luna. With "Arte" standing for "art", the new Nokia premium handset includes some new design solutions plus some software and hardware innovations. The black Nokia 8800 Arte has its panels covered by goat hide from Eastern India, which is manually embossed and has several protective coats to prevent the daily wear-and-tear. A unique silencing feature allows you to silence an incoming call just by turning the handset face down on the table thanks to the integrated accelerometer. A range of high-quality accessories is supplied with the Arte too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Last year's tops were?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last year our choice was as hard as this year's. Among the last year's highlights were the Nokia 8800 Sirocco and the LG KG800 Chocolate. The Nokia 8800 Sirocco is a handset that still holds its value and will be a great asset to your haute-couture arsenal. The LG Chocolate offers some vintage style and still manages to look sharp even with price that's way too low to make a real fashion statement of it today.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Having the slimmest handset around has turned in to a sort of a challenge for a lot of users. And while for quite some time some of the major manufacturers have abstained from participating in this cat-and-mouse game of making mobile phones as slim as possible, Samsung is working hard on being on top of that sport ranking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the introduction of its Ultra II lineup, Samsung scored the slimmest bar, slider and clamshell in world all at the same time. The most popular of them all however turned out to be the slider. Standing at only 10.9 mm, the Samsung U600 wins the attention of potential users with a classy design, a moderately capable 3.2 megapixel camera, a wonderful display and a tempting price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W880 is the slimmest Walkman today with only 9.5 mm thickness. It offers a really pleasant metallic finish and the usual high music performance. As many stores will be throwing some serious capacity memory cards along with music phones of this kind, you may get a really good deal for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung U600 (EUR 185) | review ? Sony Ericsson W880 (EUR 200) | review</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6500 classic is the slimmest offering by Nokia. It features an ultra slim, seamless design, 1GB of onboard memory and attractive metallic design. At only 9.5 mm the Nokia 6500 classic won't snatch the world record however it's still good enough for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6300 is 11.7 mm thick and is the first slim Nokia. It grabbed the attention of the public with solid build quality and no-nonsense features. It offers a pleasant alternative to its overpriced sibling the Nokia 6500 classic.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>You should also consider?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of world records, you probably noticed we didn't include the slimmest bar phone in the world - the Samsung U100. The reason is that it didn't gain as much popularity as its slider sibling. However if you are into extreme thin mobile phone - we are talking mere 5.9 mm, this may be the deal for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just in case you are short on budget and are looking for a slim handset that offers all the essentials, another Korean phone - the Samsung E200 might be just for you. With a stylish design and a solid build, the Samsung E200 makes its 9.9 mm stand out in the lower-tier crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For even less millimeters you might as well grab the Samsung Z170, a 3G-enabled handset with video calls that stands at only 9.5 mm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Last year's tops were?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last year the slim gang was led again by Samsung. The first Ultra lineup is still a good choice that offers slim handsets with plenty of features. The Samsung P310 even throws in some classic style. All of those can be found at a moderate price now, but consult their specifications in order to find the right one for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All prices are strictly indicative. They are taken from various online resources and they do not include taxes or carrier subsidies. Your local street prices will probably differ.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We suppose there are a lot of you out there that are looking for a mobile phone to take care of all daily communication and multimedia needs. UMTS support with video calls, Wi-Fi, VoiP, vast messaging options, nice camera, good music and video player and large displays are all into the deal. You would also probably want QWERTY keyboard and may be even GPS receiver built right in the thing. Well look no further, as this category is custom made for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E90 is the flagship among Nokia business class smartphones, and by business we mean feature loaded to the brim. It comes with two wonderful displays, sophisticated yet classic design, a QWERTY keyboard, a GPS receiver and 3 megapixel camera. Wi-Fi support adds to the tally, and no matter what connectivity feature you are after, you'll find it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC TyTN II is the direct competitor of the Nokia E90 and has a rather similar form factor - or sort of, at least. It's powered by Windows Mobile 6.0 instead of Symbian OS, has a 2.8" touchscreen TFT display, and takes care of the rest with a QWERTY keyboard, a GPS receiver, a 3 megapixel camera and Wi-Fi support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia E90 (EUR 610) | review ? HTC TyTN II (EUR 535) | review </paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't really complete this tour of extraordinary smart devices without mentioning the Nokia N95 8GB. It's one of the most versatile smart devices created this year, and yet compact, and there is no doubt we are seeing it appear in several categories. Large display, a great 5 megapixel camera, large storage space, dedicated multimedia keys, Wi-Fi, GPS, UMTS - it's all there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, we shouldn't forget that Sony Ericsson have their own Symbian smartphones, too. The Sony Ericsson P1 features the UIQ touch screen interface and offers a nice large display. It also has a 3 megapixel auto focus camera, Wi-Fi, UMTS support and QWERTY keypad that's a tad strange.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you are looking for a smart device, our last year's winner might be your great choice. The HTC TyTN is still a contemporary device and it offers all the comfort of a mini computer in your pocket.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A lot of the devices we saw in the previous category, called all-round performance mobiles have their place here among the business-oriented devices too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the mobile business on-the-go needs from a device is to offer seamless email and messaging, conference calls that are easy to set up, long battery life, QWERTY keyboard, MS Office documents support, good web browser, and enhanced organizing capabilities. If you throw in a FM radio or a camera, the owner will be much obliged. All these features are there in our next offerings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already told you about the Nokia E90 and HTC TyTN II. These are major competitors, equally equipped - loaded with features to the brim. The wide email support and the extensive organizing capabilities are there. Each has GPS receiver and built-in auto focus camera that does the job done with no bells and whistles. The battery life depends on how you use those two babies, but with both you have Wi-Fi and UMTS support, MS Office documents editors, and QWERTY keyboards. Before you pick one though, bear in mind that they are both rather unpocketable.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We already told you about the Sony Ericsson P1 in the last category. As you probably remember it features the UIQ touch screen interface and offers a nice large display. It also has a 3 megapixel auto focus camera, Wi-Fi, UMTS support and QWERTY keypad that's a tad strange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i600 or otherwise known in the USA as Samsung BlackJack is a wonderful example of a non-obtrusive smartphone messenger. Standing at only 11.8 mm of thickness, it also features a compact QWERTY keyboard and a wonderful display. Connectivity-wise it's also on par with the others with HSDPA and Wi-Fi support.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>When it comes to business and messaging, there is a good choice of mobile phones. Along with the handsets that we already mentioned, there are a handful of others that will also do a good job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E61i is a great choice for a messenger although it isn't as pocketable as the Samsung i600. The E61i offers a great build quality, stylish metallic finish and a really nice QWERTY keyboard. The E61i display is easily among the best of its class - one can't expect anything less from the Nokia business class lineup. The supported wireless connectivity standards are UMTS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E65 is another E-series representative. Besides UMTS, Wi-Fi and stylish conservative design, the Nokia E65 also offers dedicated conference call key for all those company meetings on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we are talking business and messaging we cannot overlook the BlackBerry family. All BlackBerry handsets are business-minded however there isn't a single one top-of-the-line model. If you want the latest and greatest BlackBerry you'll have to choose between either BlackBerry Curve 8310 with integrated GPS receiver or BlackBerry Pearl 8120 with Wi-Fi support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Last year's tops were?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last year as usual there wasn't lack of choice of business and messaging devices. Probably the highlights of all are the QWERTY-equipped HTC TyTN and Nokia E70.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you happen to have an unlimited data plan from your wireless carrier you'll most probably want a device that you can use to browse web sites the way they were meant to be browsed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we are somewhat uncomfortable of abusing the Nokia brand throughout this article, we should point out that the best mobile web browsing experience is offered by? the latest Nokia Symbian smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HSDPA has become a buzz word this year and many mobile carriers throughout Europe already offer it to users with supported devices. Having HSDPA and a good mobile web browser puts the power of mobile internet in your hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've picked the Nokia 6120 classic as our first offering in this category. Flaunting HSDPA besides UMTS and a really fast processor, the Nokia 6120 classic is a Symbian smartphone with classic looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A good alternative is the Nokia E51 which offers Wi-Fi support along the HSDPA for all those moments that you have access to a Wi-Fi hot spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6120 classic (EUR 175) | review ? Nokia E51 (EUR 256) | review </paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already told you a little bit about Samsung i600 in our previous category. Being a Windows Mobile smartphone, it allows replacing the standard Internet Explorer Mobile with a more capable third-party browser thus turning the i600 into a really capable web browsing machine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i600 (EUR 225) | review </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You should also consider?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Other web browsing mobiles that are worth considering in this category are also the HTC TyTN II, the Samsung U700, and Samsung Z170. The HTC TyTN II offers tri-band UMTS and HSDPA, which allows using the device in all 3G networks around the globe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung U700 is probably the thinnest 3G slider (you know Samsung and their obsession with thin handsets). It's equipped with the NetFront 3.4 web browser that is among the greatest browser for feature phones. Furthermore you can always install Opera Mini, which is an excellent web browsing alternative too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, if you are on a budget and really need a 3G mobile phone to use for video calling, we can recommend the Samsung Z170, which covers all the essentials.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Last year's tops were?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N73 is last year's category winner and it is an excellent choice for your 3G web browsing on the go plus some really nice camera performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So it's time for us to wrap it up and go look for some gifts for our loved ones too. This article was our attempt at saving you some time when looking for a holiday present for your friends or relatives, or even one for yourself. We won't make claims that its thorough and exhaustive or that it covers all the available options in the different categories. What we wanted to show you are the highlights of this year's achievements in the mobile industry. However, if you still don't find the right handset, please feel free to continue browsing our mobile phones database using the Phone Finder.</paragraph>
