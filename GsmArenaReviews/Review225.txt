			<paragraph>A line of multimedia-oriented handsets has secured LG a strong foothold in the cameraphone kingdom. LG KC550 is probably the first to join the club with only imaging in mind. A mid-range handset with top-of-the-shelf photo and video capabilities is probably what describes best the compact slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KC550 sure lacks the Viewty power and Secret's Black Label charisma. OK, it's unassuming, but not without a talent of its own. The 5 megapixel slider strives to be the most affordable cameraphone out there with a Wide VGA@30fps video recording topping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those qualities have set many shutterbugs a foot with excitement as they are finally promised uncompromising cameraphone capabilities at an afordable price tag that's fit for the masses. But please, don't go throwing your digital camera just yet - let's first see what LG have for us this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KC550 builds on a good track record of 5 megapixel mobile phone imaging. While the exotic KG920 is mostly noted for being the forerunner, the Secret and the Viewty do demonstrate true imaging prowess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still in the 200-250 euro (320-400 US dollars) price range, LG KC550 will be obviously taking quite some competition heat from the Samsung G600 and Sony Ericsson K850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slide-and-snap Samsung G600 advantages include quad-band GSM support, a 16M color TFT display and a range of attractive color versions. The KC550 however sports an accelerometer for auto screen rotation and interactive gaming plus a slightly larger screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K850 is also a must-consider alternative, topping the LG KC550 capabilities with a strong connectivity package (quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSDPA) and xenon flash for basically the same asking price. The K850 also doesn't have a screen as big as the one of the KC550 but manages to compensate with sound multimedia capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung G600 and Sony Ericsson K850 are a bit underpowered when it comes to video recording, while LG is promising not only top-notch photo performance but also high resolution video at 30 fps. That alone should get you interested so jump aboard as we explore the LG KC550. See you back in a flash!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG KC550 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Standing at 96.9 x 51.4 x 14.9 mm, LG KC550 is a relatively a compact slider, though a little too thick. The weight of 110 grams is understandable, as much of the phone body is made out of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The slick and shiny front panel with metallic accents meets the rubbery mat surface on the back of the LG KC550. There's metal on the back too, as the stylish and practical active lens cover has a brushed metal finish). Still the LG KC550 is anything else but sleek, fashionable or hot as the LG KF750 Secret, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's surprising how this design copied word-by-word from the LG KF700 manages to look lower end on this handset. We guess, it must be the obtrusive plastic Call and End keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece of KC550 is discreetly etched near the upper edge of the front. The glossy black front is quite neat, with the LG logo under the 2.4" screen followed by an ample D-pad and rocker-styled controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is quite comfortable with its joystick-styled confirm key. On either side of the D-pad are the two rocker combos: left soft key/call key and right soft key/end call key. The latter has a C knob integrated within. Those keys are rather plastic and add for the unassuming looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even sliding the KC550 open reveals its lower price tag - it's not as smooth as in high-end sliders. Opening the slider, reveals the flatbed alphanumeric keypad. It has the signature LG styling that has been used rather frequently ever since the original LG Chocolate came out. The keys are large and have adequate press feedback, but offer little touch orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing but the mouthpiece and the battery cover latch at the bottom. The top is also very plain, with the lanyard eyelet in the right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the handset we only find the LG universal connectivity port hidden under a nice sliding cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The crowded right side hosts the volume rocker, the two-step shutter key, and a microSD card slot with a rubbery protective cap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the rubbery surface on the back and the active lens cover with brushed metal finish is both a handy tool and a nice accent. The 5 megapixel autofocus camera lens with Power LED flash and a self-portrait mirror is under it. The loudspeaker of KC550 is also at the rear. We only wish that the front of the device looked as good as the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may remember how pleased we were with the battery cover release mechanism of KF750. Well, in KC550 it's based on the same idea but this time a little extra effort is required. Having pressed the latch, the battery cover needs to be pulled to get it removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath is the 900 mAh Li-ion battery quoted at 450 hours of stand-by time and 6 hours of talk-time. Unfortunately, we can't comment on the real-life performance of the KC550.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the focus on affordability, LG KC550 is a nice surprise in terms of construction. We are quite pleased with the build quality and handling, although the handset looks are obviously not among its selling points.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display is large, but not that good in sunlight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KC550 has a 2.4" display of QVGA resolution (240 x 320 pixels). Picture quality is excellent, with pleasing contrast and brightness levels. The bad news is the sunlight legibility, which is not quite there. Yet the LG KC550 fairs a lot better than the KF750 Secret. It's no secret that the LG Secret has a sunlight legibility that's severely handicapped by the glossy screen finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KC550 keypad has strong and even white backlighting, which goes well with the display brightness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KC550 offers smooth and problem-free performance when it comes to the most essential element of a phone - making calls. It offers good reception and in-call sound, with pleasing voice quality on both ends of a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, LG KC550 does not sport Smart Dialing - a feature that automatically looks up contacts, whose numbers contain the digits you type on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also put the KC550 to our traditional loudspeaker test. Here is how it ranks against some of the other handsets exposed to the same challenge. The KC550 turned out as one of the loudest handsets we had tested. You can find more information about the test itself and the whole list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KC550 features the regular LG user interface. It scores high on visual appeal and user-friendliness. The menu looks are widely customizable making the fast and responsive device a pleasure to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen has information about the current time and date, as well as the typical status readings. It shows signal strength, the active profile and the battery status. In standby mode you can opt for displaying the shortcuts assigned to the four directions of the D-pad as an overlay on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu structure of LG KC550 is straightforward and easy to work with. Except for a few strangely placed settings, everything else makes perfect sense. The different files and features are exactly where you would expect them to be, even if you don't have much experience with LG handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pleasant surprise was the fact that the LG KC550 can start up without a SIM card - that's rather unusual for LG mobiles. If you have a SIM card in, but you want to turn off all transceivers, there is also a Flight mode available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customizing the KC550<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KC550 has several appearance customization options. There are two pre-installed themes - the Black 3D and Black line themes. The menu view modes don't differ across themes, unlike the very distinct layouts in the two themes of KF750 Secret. Other customization options include altering the main font style and the dialing font style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature is that both of the available themes offer a liquid-like home screen wallpaper, which responds to the accelerometer input. So when you tilt the LG KC550, the dynamic liquid on your home screen changes its orientation too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook limited<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook in LG KC550 can store up to 1000 entries. The contacts stored on SIM and phone memory display simultaneously in alphabetic order. There is no option for contacts to be ordered by first or last name, as there's only one name field. That's kind of strange and might be inconvenient if you sync with a PC or another handset that has the usual first and last name fields.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user can opt for showing the caller ID images in the phonebook list along the names. Searching is performed by gradual typing, but again if you have contacts with a first and a last name, it will only search for the first name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An irritating feature is that the first thing you see when you enter the Phonebook is the Contacts options menu instead the actual contacts list. The latter appears only after you select Search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum number of available contact info fields on the LG KC550 phonebook are 11, including 3 phone numbers. You can save a note, along with a personal photo and a ringtone, as well as an email address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, LG KC550 features the well-known grouping: contacts can be organized in groups for easier management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a general, the phonebook seems to offer enough for the mass users, however the lack of separate first/last name fields and the annoying two-click access to the contacts list can turn some of the potential users away.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is so-so<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KC550 handles all of the most common type of messages: SMS, EMS, MMS, and email and even tops those with Bluetooth messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first three message types share a common editor. There is a counter showing the number of symbols remaining to the limit of 160. When that limit has been exceeded, the editor turns another page, which should serve as an indication that the message will be sent in two chunks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to switch between different types of messages is insert some multimedia content - like a photo or an audio track for example. The editor itself has rather basic looks and that's one thing we weren't particularly fond of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact that all messages share an editor on the LG KC550 has a somewhat negative impact on user-friendliness. Now all sorts of unneeded options pop in the way when you are trying to send a simple text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is quite easy to work with and mailboxes can be set up in no time. The big downer here is the lack of SSL support. It makes using popular mail services such as Gmail impossible with the native email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, at least as far as Gmail is concerned, LG have pre-installed a Google package on the KC550 that gets you access not only to Google search, but also to Google Mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So generally, as far as the most common messaging needs are concerned, the KC550 is a passable performer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management is poor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>File management in KC550 is as awkward as always with LG phones. Each type of file content has its own designated folder. The files cannot be copied between the folders as duplicate files on the phone memory (even in different folders) are obviously not allowed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create custom sub-folders however you still cannot copy content to them - you can only move files around - one by one or en masse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card contents are listed as an additional folder in the browser structure and if you don't use the default LG-created folders on the memory card you are bound for a lot of trouble. For example, to play music files straight from the file manager, you need to put them in the Sounds folder. The same goes for documents - as strange as it may sound, you cannot open an office document unless it's stored in the Documents folder - be it on the phone memory or the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of phone memory, the LG KC550 offers really inadequate amount of built-in storage memory - 12MB is not near enough even for a few 5 megapixel shots. As LG doesn't ship the KC550 with a pre-bundled memory card, a new microSD card should be first on your shopping list right after the LG handset itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to memory cards, the LG KC550 supports capacities of up to 4GB. We managed to confirm both that a 4GB card runs fine on the little fella, as well as that larger cards (8GB) are not supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is user-friendly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of LG KC550 is both functional and user-friendly and is accessible through the My stuff icon in the main menu. It offers two view modes: thumbnail with 9 thumbs on screen, and list view with only 7 file names with tiny thumbs displayed. It's no surprise we liked the first one better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single pictures can be viewed in both landscape and portrait mode, and can also be displayed fullscreen. You can also zoom in to see further detail. Be warned that the zooming is on the slow side and if you have to do too much of if it might just get too annoying. On the other hand, we are pleased with the panning speed and as well as with the overall speed of LG KC550 in general when handling multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in accelerometer also kicks in when you browse images. The auto screen rotation is a really nice feature and it's no wonder that it's getting more popular than ever in current handsets. The speed of screen rotation is not lightning fast, but is quite adequate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other extras of this gallery include picture sorting (by name, date or type) and slide show. In all fairness, we are not satisfied with the plain slide show capabilities of LG KC550 not featuring music playback and choice of transition effects. On top of that, the slideshow doesn't override the display power saving settings, so essentially the display goes off often while you watch a slide show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image gallery also sports a capable Image Editor that offers a lot of adjustable options. You can resize, rotate, crop, insert text or add special effects to the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The additional photo art section allows you to tune brightness and contrast or add blur and spotlight effect. You can also convert the image to Sepia color tone or enhance the reds or the greens in your images. Frames can be added to the images too. Overall, it's one of the most capable image editors we've seen on a mobile phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An excellent music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on LG KC550 deserves praise for performance and user-friendliness. It sorts tracks by three different filters - artist, album and genre. You can also create your own playlist if you like. The player offers nice visualization options, including Album art and equalizer bars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other nice options include My playlist, where you get to filter Recent and Favorite tracks, while the On the go section is for creating up to 50 custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 10 equalizer presets on KC550. Unluckily, they cannot be modified and new custom ones cannot be created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music can be enjoyed on LG KC550 with the FM radio too. Its interface is rather simple and generally very easy to work with. However the FM radio implementation has a number of drawbacks. There are only 12 slots for storing stations, there is no RDS support, and the radio cannot play in the background. All that makes you wonder what were they thinking, doesn't it?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KC550 has wide video file support. Thanks to auto screen rotation, the clips are automatically displayed in landscape mode, once you turn the phone horizontally. It's fast and accurate, so it's essentially a really nice feature. Fast-forwarding and rewinding are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to the official LG specs, the KC550 should be able to decode video up to 720 x 480 pixels at 30fps. Unfortunately, we couldn't test that as we didn't have a video in that specific resolution and we have somewhat bitter experience with playing custom user-encoded videos on mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MPEG4 videos in VGA resolution at 30fps play just fine though. Even MOV video with H.264 encoding is said to be supported but for some reason the handset failed to play that correctly. And finally, we just want to make it clear that the KC550 doesn't have AVI or DivX support as some regional LG websites suggest.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Today's star is the 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KC550 flaunts a 5 megapixel camera with auto focus. It's capable of producing images with a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. The camera is using Schneider-Kreuznach certified optics, so lens related issues are not expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features also include digital image stabilization (not that useful) and a Power LED flash, which also serves as an AF assist light. The Power LEDs are used widely in mobile phones lately - they are said to provide much more light than regular LED flashes of the past. Sony Ericsson seem to favor them too at the expense of the xenon flashes that made them popular back in the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the LG KC550 camera doesn't feature face detection - that's a feature that might have given it additional edge over the competition in this 5 megapixel price segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In camera mode, four frequently used camera settings get assigned to the four ways of the D-pad - flash control, macro mode, image stabilizer and the gallery are all accessible from there. These functions are actually inscribed as icons on the D-pad itself. Furthermore, almost all other camera features have their shortcuts on the alphanumeric keys as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface sports the familiar black and white color scheme. The camera features white balance setting, color effects and ISO control (up to 800). Have in mind though, that photos produced at the highest sensitivity level (ISO 800) aren't really usable as they suffer severely from digital noise. The only camera settings that we found missing here are some preset shooting scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On our retail UK unit, the camera shutter tone could not be muted, however that's usually a region and market specific option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several camera samples produced by the LG KC550:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KC550 vs. LG KF750 Secret camera shoot-out</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the LG KC550 is among the few recent handsets that are all camera-centric, image quality is obviously a really important factor for its market success. So we decided to do a little impromptu camera shootout between the LG KC550 and the top-of-the-line LG KF750 Secret.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones feature Schneider-Kreuznach certified optics (the lens look exactly the same to us) and they probably have identical 5 megapixel sensors. So it comes as a no surprise that the imaging system delivers about the same level of detail on both devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processing however is what sets them apart. It's quite interesting that LG uses different approaches to image processing in each cameraphone. LG Viewty had unprocessed images with a slight red tint, LG Secret has got the color balance right, but its saturation levels are too high and the noise reduction algorithm is hard on the fine details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now LG KC550 goes back to the unprocessed look, but this time with a slight yellow tint and tuned down contrast and saturation. Unprocessed images usually produce great results after some plain post-processing tasks on a desktop PC - such as resizing to a lower resolution, contrast increase and sharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However we guess the majority of users don't bother to post-process their images. It's that user group that will most certainly prefer the LG KF750 Secret images, as they have more punch to them straight out of the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nonetheless, LG KC550 shows some great performance for its price tag, and it's easily worth a place among the modern cameraphone ranks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera user interface is the same as the one of the still camera and offers settings for video mode (general and MMS), color effects, brightness, resolution, quality, flash and white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To give the LG KC550 an edge, the manufacturer has equipped it with unsurpassed video recording capabilities in this price range. The KC550 is pitched to record D1 video, which is the so-called full TV resolution. Depending on the context, D1 may mean any of the following: 704x576 (TV PAL), 704x480 (TV NTSC), 720x576 (DVD-Video PAL), 720x480 (DVD-Video NTSC). LG however have specified that they mean exactly 720x480 pixels and that's a commendable achievement. At least on paper, that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality all the recording is in the lowly 3GP video format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus when played on PC, the videos in 720x480 pixels resolution show up in the same 4:3 aspect ratio as the VGA videos instead in the 3:2 ratio that the resolution suggests. In effect subjects seem strangely elongated. The solution is to force the 3:2 aspect ratio from your video player. That sounds like a potential source of a lot of headaches when sharing videos with other people that are not aware of this peculiarity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, those framerates! We had some video recording issues with the first KC550 we used originally for this review. It was able to record D1 and VGA videos alright, but only at 15fps. Now almost four months later we received a finalized unit and we were more than happy to test out its video framerates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the previous unit, this KC550 is indeed able to record D1 video at 30fps, but VGA videos are still docked at 15fps. Seems kinda strange, isn?t it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a closer inspection, the D1 video showed a choppiness that?s only fit for 15fps videos. So we decided to dig further into the matter and we literally went through the D1 video frame by frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It turned out that LG are pulling wool over your eyes as some of the 30 frames recorded in the sample second that was the subject of our scrutiny were identical. We identified a total of 20 unique frames among these purported 30 frames. And these weren?t evenly distributed so our final guess is that LG KC550 is ?instructed? to take as many frames as possible and duplicate some of them in order to reach a total of 30 per second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in a nutshell, the low quality video, dodgy framerate and mixed up video aspect ratio has ruined the LG KC550 video recording for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But don't just take our word for it, take a look at our sample videos for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KC550 video sample in 720x480 pixels at faux 30fps (3.0MB)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KC550 video sample in 640x480 pixels at 15fps (2.5MB)</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity on average<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity options are obviously not among the strongest points of LG KC550. It has tri-band GSM support only and you'd have to rely on GPRS and EDGE for wireless data transfers, as there is no UMTS support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the LG KC550 packs stereo Bluetooth (A2DP) and USB support and there's also TV-out functionality that we couldn't test since we didn't have a LG TV-out cable handy. A TV-out cable is not included in the retail package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KC550 comes with Access NetFront HTML browser, which is quite good actually. It offers good page rendering plus an optimized rendering mode where text is even easier to read. The only downside of this mode is that the page no longer looks as if browsed on PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser of LG KC550 also has a virtual mouse pointer that jumps between links. However, just like the one on LG KF600 and KF750 Secret, the mouse pointer moves rather illogically, which can become irritating on more complex pages. You can hardly foresee its next step when a lot of links are placed close together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A good feature upon exiting the browser is the GPRS session counter, which tells you how much data had been generated within the last session.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are not happy with the default browser, you can always take advantage of a third-party Java browser, like the excellent Opera Mini for example.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Regular organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of organizer capabilities, the LG KC550 seems capable enough .The calendar offers only monthly view mode and when putting down a new event, there's no event type choice. The event settings are also basic and include only date, time, alarm, subject, and repeat options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KC550 also features an alarm clock application. It handles up to 5 different alarms, each with its own name, ringtone and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use either the Memo application or the Voice recorder to put down notes on the go. The calculator, stopwatch and unit converter are well known applications that go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock application is a nice little helper that can tell you the current time in any time zone. In terms of layout and graphics it's really great and it also has an extremely large database of cities for each region and time zone. The only thing missing is a search option to make selecting a location easier but that's something we can live with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KC550 also offers an office document viewer courtesy of Access - the same guys who have delivered the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The document viewer supports TXT, PDF, DOC, PPT, and XLS file support and performance is good enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Accelerometer gaming is on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are two regular Java games preinstalled on LG KC550: Extreme Skateboard and Mini Game World.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from these two, the phone also offers the M-toy - a set of 6 mini-games, which put the built-in accelerometer and vibration feedback to use. They are the same as the ones featured on the LG KF750 Secret.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The six games that are part of the M-Toy application are Dart, Homerun Derby, Magic Ball, Hammer, Maze, and Fishing. Dart is a darts game where you send your darts flying by swinging the handset itself. The Homerun Derby is a baseball batting game where you play as the batter unleashing your bat again by swinging the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Hammer, where you play a hammer thrower - swinging the handset around builds up power before you finally release the hammer with the D-pad. The Maze game includes navigating a ball around an increasingly complex maze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Fishing game, where you play as the angler controlling your fishing rod - you are responsible of swinging your rod to the right place and then reeling back the fishing line once you have a fish on your hook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the Magic Ball is pretty self explanatory - the Magic 8-Ball is a well-known yes/no fortune telling game but the LG implementation is not that traditional and at times offers some really funny answers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KC550 is without a doubt a nice performer with balanced functionality. It's not an all-round multimedia device and it's not meant to be one. The LG KC550 is a no-thrills, all-camera handset that does the job it's made for and it does it well. The sunlight legibility and the awkward file manager are not deal-breakers and being the soft spot of most LG handsets, they don't seem to hurt LG global sales that much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really liked the 5 megapixel camera performance and if it weren't for the disappointing video recording and the unassuming looks, the LG KC550 would have made it as a top-of-its-class package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a price tag of around 220 euro (360 US dollars), image quality doesn't get much better than that. The snappy performance and the accelerometer functionality (both in multimedia and gaming) also seem to add value.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But unfortunately for LG, last year's 5 megapixel cameraphones are now coming of age and with prices dropping down, these once high-end devices pack some great value for your hard-earned cash. And unless we see a more capable retail version of the KC550 (mostly in the video recording department) or a heavy price reconsideration, we have no other option but to advise you to look elsewhere for your next cameraphone. Currently, the Sony Ericsson K850 Cyber-shot seems as the most viable buying choice in this price range.</paragraph>
