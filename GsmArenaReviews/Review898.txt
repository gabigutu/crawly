			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini with Retina screen is everything the little tablet deserved to be - a more compact equal of the bigger iPad with no compromises made. And unfortunately, it's just one thing short of what we all thought a compact tablet should be - cheap. Well, Apple isn't exactly known for selling cheap, it's quite on the contrary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year's iPad mini was more of a byproduct of the iPad lineup - with a significantly cheaper price, a different design and somewhat inferior hardware, the baby iPad was quite different to its full size sibling. This year marks a shift in Apple's product strategy. Now, the two new iPads are equals - with the mini being merely a scaled down version of the same spectacular screen tech and the same high-performance internals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's been no corner cutting this time and the new iPad mini is more expensive as a result. We guess the price hike comes only to highlight the iPad mini's new standing in the pecking order - it's no longer the budget option - it's the more portable version of the same flagship product. A lower price point would have also hurt the big iPad sales because the two tablets are not at all that different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You would actually be amazed how identical the two look. But that's a good thing in a sense. Users no longer have to pick one of the two based on feature set or design, or bezel size for that matter. Now, you can just pick the size that's right for you. The high-end user experience is all there without any give or take.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comparing it to its predecessor, the Apple iPad mini with Retina screen looks no different either, but that's until you turn it on. The new screen is impressively sharp and the new chipset is blazing fast, meaning loading times in most apps are noticeably faster now. The Wi-Fi speeds have doubled, there is a seriously bigger battery inside, there is a second mic for noise cancellation and now you have a brand new 128GB version, if you've got the money to burn - the last generation iPad mini maxed out at 64GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new iPad mini is exactly the same size like last year's with a mere .3mm difference in thickness. You wouldn't feel that sort of difference even if you had both in your hands. What you may notice is the difference in weight. The new iPad mini is 23g heavier to accommodate the larger battery, which should deliver the same endurance despite the quadrupled resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new dual-core 64-bit A7 chipset inside the new mini jumps two generations ahead of the A5 processor in the original. It's not that the older mini was sluggish, but the new device is notably faster and more responsive in almost all apps we tried.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last season's bigger iPad at least had the luxury of being more powerful but those days are gone. Now the two size of iPads have equally good specs, which kinda puts the iPad Air in a sticky position. It's true that the bigger Air is easier to carry than any other full-size iPad and the slimmer frame helps single-handed operation but there's no avoiding the fact that the iPad mini is the friendlier form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini's handling and portability could be the big decider for a lot of people who are eyeing a new iPad for Christmas. To be honest, we don't think Apple will mind no matter which one you pick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, it's still up to the mini to prove itself as a true equal to the big gun. And so it will. Join us ahead where we intend to subject it to every test we have around our test lab. This shorty will not be getting off easy, we promise.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A big white box, but in the good sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of accessories the Apple iPad mini 2 comes with a lightning cable and an A/C adapter - hardly a surprise after a few generations of tablets already. There are of course the usual leaflets and a couple of stickers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail box this year has almost twice the height of the last year's mini packaging. The culprit is the bigger 10W 2A charger (as opposed to last year's 5W unit), which is the same as the one supplied with the iPad Air.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Same on the outside<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are no two ways about it, the new iPad mini looks just the same as the old iPad mini. It even measures pretty much the same so you would have some pretty hard time telling the two apart with their screens off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a tip for you, a little telltale feature is the second microphone pinhole, which can be seen on the back of the iPad mini with Retina screen. It's close to the camera lens and it's about the only difference in their machined aluminum bodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new iPad mini comes in the same "black front/gray back" and "white front/silver back" paint jobs, both of which look exactly the same as on the Air even on closer inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini is like a miniaturized carbon copy of the iPad Air too - complete with a smaller Home key and thinner bezels. The volume keys and the silencer switch and the camera lenses are identical in size on both iPads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downsizing was only limited to the exterior. They share the internals - the same camera and the same A7 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you turn on the iPad mini 2 it becomes evident where all the work has gone into. The new high-resolution Retina IPS LCD screen is spectacularly sharp. On a 7.9-inch diagonal, the new resolution of 1536 x 2048px works out to a pixel density of 324ppi. That's four times the pixel count and double the pixel density compared to the original mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen (if you can take your eyes off it) we find the same 1.2MP resolution front-facing camera as last year. It's capable of 720p video capture. Next to it, there's an ambient light sensor, which helps in adjusting the screen brightness automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the screen lies the familiar home button. We all hoped to see Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the iPad mini 2 and iPad Air much like on the iPhone 5s, but to no avail. So, perhaps next year?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the iPad mini 2 is completely free of any controls, while on the right we find the the two volume keys and the silencer switch (that one can also lock screen orientation if you choose so in the system settings). The volume keys have solid feedback and are generally very comfortable, the only usability problem is reaching them when you hold the tablet in landscape orientation - they are quite far off from where you fingers would rest and not directly visible when you look at the screen straight on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year's stereo speakers are here as well. These are hardly unforeseen as it was namely the original iPad mini that premiered the double speakers setup in the iPad family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subjectively, the speakers don't leave an impression of being as loud as we hoped - we'll test their loudness further in our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The issue with the speaker setup remains the same as before - they are really easy to muffle with your hand when holding the iPad in landscape orientation. Also they are so close together that we couldn't spot a perceivable stereo effect in whatever game or video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, set in-between the two speakers, we find the now typical Lightning connector port. The top of the iPad mini 2 is reserved for the 3.5 mm headphone jack and one of the two microphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second microphone is on the back of the slate, close to the camera. This year Apple introduced a dual mic setup, which is used for active noise cancellation in things like FaceTime calls or talking to Siri. The system works just fine isolating your voice nicely during calls when you hold the iPad in front of you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 MP camera sits on the back of the new iPad mini, in the top left corner. It's got a F/2.4 aperture and it's got a viewing angle of 33mm (in 35mm terms), so not much of a difference to last year. There is no LED flash much like there isn't one on the iPad Air or the last year's iPad mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 sits comfortably in your hands in both portrait and landscape orientation and many of us find this sort of screen size to be the sweet spot for a tablet. iOS looks like a natural fit for the 7.9-inch screen and it doesn't feel as if we're using a blown up iPhone interface as it does on the iPad Air.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Screen resolution is as high as it gets on a compact tablet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple introduced the Retina display back in 2012 on the third-generation iPad and hasn't increased the resolution since. What's amazing however is that now we get the same high resolution in a compact sub-8-inch tablet. The competition may have 10-inchers with higher resolution, but in the compact segment, the iPad mini screen resolution is as high as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a stark contrast to last year's iPad mini, the new screen is incredibly sharp. The number of pixels has been quadrupled (3.1M pixels vs. 0.78M pixels) and the mini has doubled the pixel density of the original (324ppi vs. 162ppi). Now, it's really hard to spot the individual pixels with your bare eyes and even the smallest of fonts look clear and legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement on the LCD matrix is the same as on the iPad Air - you get a standard red, green and blue pixel side by side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the numbers the iPad mini 2 stacks pretty well against the competition. Its contrast is not the best we have seen, but the colors are nicely rendered and the viewing angles are very decent for a tablet..</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 is equipped with a 45% more battery capacity than last year's mini (23.8Wh vs. 16.3Wh) just so it can achieve the same manufacturer rating of 10h of runtime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, manufacturer ratings are never to be taken at face value, so we did our usual set of battery life tests to see how the iPad mini 2 stacks up against the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy to report that the Apple iPad mini 2 did more than enough to live up to Apple's claims and then some. The slate managed a 10:47 hour run in our Wi-Fi web browsing test. That's nearly 40 minutes more than the iPad Air, but it should come as no surprise - the mini 2 has a much smaller screen and the chipsets are almost identical (save for a small difference in clock speed). More importantly, the improvement over the original iPad mini is over an hour and a half.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The big iPad Air comes out ahead of the iPad mini 2 by half an hour in our video playback test. This test doesn't stress the CPU, so the bigger battery of the Air managed to feed the bigger screen slightly longer. This score is also half an hour less than the original iPad mini.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Still, for all intents and purposes the two Apple iPads have the same battery life. Compared to the original iPad mini, the mini 2 shows tangible improvements in the web browsing department and a slight regression in video playback. More importantly, Android tablets struggle to outlast the iPad mini - the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition is behind by 3 hours in both tests and the Asus Transformer Pad is 2 hours behind, coming out ahead only when attached to its dock (which has an additional battery).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPad mini with Retina screen runs iOS 7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini with Retina screen runs iOS 7 buttery smooth, the same version of the OS that has already been shipping on the latest iPad Air and iPhone 5s. Lots of iOS users have already updated to iOS 7 so even if you haven't purchased one of these new devices, chances are you may already have seen it in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS7 is a major overhaul of the user interface with a new design language that has been picking up speed with app developers ever since its release. Apple's latest mobile operating system has got brand-new flat looks, generous use of transparency, redesigned icons for all Apple apps, reshuffled controls and search and lots of small touches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 has already made its way to the compatible iGadgets out there and it is already quite well known, but its looks remain a moot point among iOS users. Suffice it to say some love it, while others hate it - there doesn't seem to be any other way about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already covered iOS7 in the greatest detail in a dedicated article, as well as in our iPad Air and iPhone 5s/5c reviews, so we'll be reusing some portions of those reviews. Still, we've taken great care to adapt it to match what you would meet on the iPad mini 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we continue, here is a quick video demonstration of the new iOS 7 running on the iPad mini 2:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 looks a lot different compared to its predecessors, but its logic of operation is mostly the same. All of your apps are spread across the homescreen panes. A longer press on any of the icons, activates Edit mode, which allows you to change their position or group them into folders. At the bottom of the homescreen, there is the familiar dock that can take up to four shortcuts, which are always accessible no matter which pane you are on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All system icons are different in the iOS 7: the clock now has an animated icon showing the current time, the system fonts have been altered, and there are lots of semi-transparent elements and new gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start from the beginning - the lockscreen. It's totally different and yet it works in a familiar way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slide-to-unlock bar is now gone and you can swipe anywhere on the screen to unlock your iPad mini 2. The camera shortcut at the bottom is also avaialble, you can swipe up from there for quick access to the camera app. A double press of the Home key will bring up the multimedia controls as usual. Lockscreen notifications are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can notice two transparent small lines at the top and the bottom of the lockscreen. Swiping from the top down will display the Notifications Center, while swiping up from the bottom will bring up the new Control Center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen out of the way reveals the revamped homescreen. The Spotlight pane is now gone - but not lost. You can search throughout your iPad mini 2 just as before, but the search field becomes available with a new pull-down gesture, which can start from anywhere on the screen but the top (because that would open the Notifications Center).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still group apps into folders just as before, but now, there is no longer a limit to how many apps you can stash inside. As soon as you add enough apps, the folder contents get automatically paginated with each page hosting up to nine apps. Another new thing is you can finally put the pre-installed Newsstand app away in a folder, should you wish so. Previously, it was the only application that wouldn't go into a folder like the rest of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opening and closing of folders is now accompanied by a cool animation. These take a bit too long, though, and might become irritating once you are past their initial "wow" phase. You can disable the folder animations, the opening and closing app animations plus the parallax effect in the settings, which will speed things a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The folder icons and the folder backgrounds are semi-transparent so you would see a hint of the homescreen background behind them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification and Control Center backgrounds are also semi-translucent, just like the folders', and their looks will differ depending on the background. So they might be blue-ish on the homescreen, but light gray in the web browser, or dark gray in the settings, or green in the gallery, etc. Unlike the iPhone's keyboard, the one on the iPad is not semi-transparent, and its background is not adaptive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is observable throughout iOS 7. Apple designed the new iOS on independent layers - background, homescreen icons, icon badges, and then app pop-ups. The iPad mini 2 then uses its accelerometer and gyroscope to move layers independently as you handle the device, creating an illusion of depth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is not only available on the homescreen. You can see it in folders and display notifications, as well as in the popups that ask you for passwords. Those popups by the way are also translucent and adapt their background color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you don't like the parallax effect you can turn it off in the Accessibility settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 brings along live wallpapers. You can find them in the relevant section of the Wallpaper Settings. Currently there are seven live wallpapers but there is no wallpaper section available in the App Store. It seems we'll have to rely on Apple to add more with future system updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing to note here is that the homescreen parallax effect we mentioned seems to disappear when you pick a dynamic wallpaper. To compensate for that, the dynamic wallpaper elements react to the movement of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple decided not to follow the competition and put the connectivity toggles in the notification area. They're in a brand new Control Center instead, that's pulled up with a swipe from the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has two of non-customizable rows for various shortcuts. The top row has the music controls, five toggles (Airplane, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, DND mode and Rotation Lock), plus two shortcuts - Clock and Camera. The second row has the volume and brightness sliders alongside the AirDrop and AirPlay shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center has been redesigned as well and now occupies the entire screen of the iPad mini 2. It has three tabs: Today, All and Missed. The Today tab has the date, a summary of all events for the day, calendar day view, reminders and tomorrow's summary. As usual, you can choose which apps you want to show up in the pull-down Notifications and in what order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no option to add stocks in the iPad's notification center, as the iPad doesn't come with the native Stocks app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Today tab is customizable, and you can disable its elements one by one - everything but the date displayed at the top can be removed so it doesn't get in the way. You can even disable the Today tab altogether in the Notification Center for the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The All tab is basically the notification center from iOS 6 but sans the weather, stocks and calendar events. The calendar is now part of the Today tab, while the weather and stocks are gone for good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can disable the All tab for the lockscreen as well (just turn off Notifications View). If both Notifications (All) and Today tabs are disabled, the entire Notification Center will no longer be available on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Missed tab lists new emails, messages and missed FaceTime calls you received while your iPad mini 2 was locked. Those notifications are still available in the All tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the handling of notifications hasn't changed. You can opt to disable a notification, set it to be a banner, which will shortly pop up over the status bar or an alert showing up at the center of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also options to disable badges on app icons or disable lockscreen notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The banner notification is very subtle. If you receive a text in the middle of something, it will briefly pop up over the status bar and disappear in a couple of seconds, and not distract from what you're doing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode has been part of the iOS ever since v.6 so it's available on the iPad mini 2, too. It gives users more control over notifications. If turned on, it will mute incoming FaceTime calls or alerts. You can allow FaceTime calls from your favorite contacts and have the option to set a specific time interval in which you won't get any notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dedicated toggle to activate the DND feature and it can be customized in the Notifications submenu. When Do Not Disturb is on, a crescent icon appears next to the clock in the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to Apple, iOS 7 offers multi-tasking for all apps. Previously true multi-tasking was reserved only for navigation or music streaming apps, the rest had to go in suspend mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, this multi-tasking for all apps will surely drain the battery faster than Apple would have liked, so there is a catch. Yes, all apps will work in the background, but iOS will learn which one of them you use most often and when.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's say you open the Facebook app every morning and don't use it for the rest of the day. iOS will soon learn that and will optimize the app to align with your routine until you change it. This means most of the day and night the app will still be in suspend mode (push notifications will work of course), but iOS will run Facebook shortly before your alarm goes on and load all the content. That way when you open it, your news feed will be already updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed that apps also update in the background when push notifications come in. This is a part of what Apple calls opportunistic updates - the iPad waits until a data connection is available and starts the updates then, so it doesn't need to activate the connection on another occasion and waste your battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All apps that use Cellular/Wi-Fi connection and can work in the background are listed under Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Background App refresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task-switcher interface is invoked with a double tap on the Home key or a 4/5-finger swipe up the screen. It looks a lot like the webOS cards of old and, more recently, the HTC Sense Task switcher - all apps are presented with cards that you can swipe up and away to close. Each card has the respective app icon so you can easily recognize what's what.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multitasking UI works in both portrait and landscape mode, but you cannot see more than three cards at a time. It's one of the limitations of the card interface and we suspect this is why HTC went for a different task switcher with the One, but here's hoping that Apple will at least fix the landscape mode down the line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four/five-finger multi-tasking gestures are also available on the iOS 7 running on iPad mini 2. You can switch between the active apps using four (or five)-finger swipes. A similar swipe to the top will bring up the task switcher. Finally, you can use a four (or five) finger pinch zoom out to dismiss an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gestures are fine, but they could have been more obvious. As things stand right now, if you didn't stumble upon them by accident or if you didn't look them up on the internet, there is no way to guess how they work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 Settings menu has the same layout as in previous iPad versions but updated with the new flat and borderless look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing worth mentioning is the Vimeo and Flickr integration in addition to Twitter and Facebook. Once you enter your account details in the settings you can upload your photos straight to your Flickr gallery, while your videos will go to Vimeo. You just need to hit the share key on a picture or a video and use the dedicated Flickr/Vimeo icon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance benchmarking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini with Retina screen utilizes Apple's latest A7 chipset, which is found on the iPad Air and the iPhone 5s. It's the world's first 64-bit mobile system-on-a-chip and as usual, Apple claims it is twice as fast as the previous A6 chip with graphic performance improvements reportedly reaching up 4x that of the A6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple A7 28-nm chip is comprised of a 1.3GHz dual-core CPU, dubbed Cyclone, which uses ARM's ARMv8 microarchitecture (yet to premiere elsewhere). The GPU, while not officially confirmed, is believed to be the PowerVR G6430. The use of a 64-bit instruction set for the CPU enables Apple to put more than 4GB of RAM on its future generation of products, but the iPad mini 2, just like the iPhone 5s, packs just 1GB. Not that this feels insufficient - the way iOS handles multi-tasking you are extremely unlikely to run out of operating memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already benchmarked the performance of the iPad Air and the iPhone 5s so we know what to expect. The A7 is a potent chipset with blazing fast performance. Of course, our iPad mini 2 review would not be complete if we don't put it through the usual benchmarks too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start with the Geekbech 3 test to see how the CPU and memory are doing. Surprisingly, the iPad mini with Retina screen did worse than both the iPad Air and the iPhone 5s in this test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran the iOS version of Linpack. Again, the new iPad mini scored worse than both the iPad Air and the iPhone 5s. It's still in the same league though, just not quite there with the rest.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then came time for the multi-platform GFXBench, which is really good at giving the GPUs a run for its money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 scored the same as the iPad Air in the Egypt offscreen test, both sharing the second spot in our all-time chart, just few fps shy of beating the Galaxy Note 3 for the top spot. It's worth noting that the iPad mini 2 score in the Egypt test was more than three times better than what the original iPad mini scored - much in line with what Apple claim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the T-Rex offscreen test, the iPad mini 2 surprisingly outperformed both the iPad Air and the Galaxy Note 3, securing the first spot in this benchmark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran the GFXBench on-screen tests. Quite expectedly, because of the iPad mini 2's higher resolution screen, it delivered a lower framerate than the iPhone 5s on the high-quality T-Rex graphic test. Still, from our real life tests the iPad seems perfectly equipped to handle every modern game hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this set of benchmarks the iPad mini with Retina screen scored the same as the iPad Air, but lower than the original iPad mini. This means that in pure rendering power the new GPU is barely powerful enough to compensate fully for the massive increase in screen resolution. As a result, the older iPad mini outputs a higher frame rate (though we are talking about a marginal difference).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we put the iPad mini 2 through the SunSpider and BrowserMark benchmarks to test Safari's JavaScript and overall browsing performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the iPad mini with Retina screen scored a bit worse than the iPad Air and the iPhione 5s on both benchmarks. It's a small margin though and the Safari browser on the iPad mini 2 remains one of the fastest browsers around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Summing it all up, the iPad mini with Retina screen seems to be is as fast as the iPad Air and the iPhone 5s with only some marginal differences in test scores. The mini tablet has lots of graphics processing power and even managed to top our all-time chart in the offscreen GFXBench T-Rex test. However due to the immensely increased screen resolution, the iPad mini 2 renders graphics-intensive games in about the same frame rate as the original iPad mini. The new CPU coupled with the latest generation PowerVR Series 6 GPU make the A7chipset the best performer on the market and will leave nobody disappointed.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A new iOS version just can't afford to pay no attention to Siri. After more than two years in development the assistant has finally graduated from beta.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as the rest of the iOS 7, Siri now looks different. It always launches in full-screen and has a real-time voice graph. Another UI novelty is the option to edit your voice request with the keyboard in case Siri didn't hear you right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri supports and understands English (American, Canadian, Australian, British), French (France, Canada, Switzerland), German (Germany, Switzerland), Japanese, Italian (Italy, Switzerland), Spanish (Mexico, Spain, US), Mandarin (China, Taiwan), Korean, and Cantonese (Hong Kong) languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most important Siri upgrades, of course, are under the hood. Siri now has Wikipedia integration and it offers new voices, there is both female and male English US for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri can also carry out commands affecting the iOS - it can turn Bluetooth or Wi-Fi on/off, increase brightness, play voicemails, check other people's social network status, play iTunes Radio stations, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri is a really powerful voice assistant capable of POI search. Assistance with restaurant booking is part of Siri's set of skills. It will search for exactly the restaurant you need and it will filter the results based on user reviews. You can run impressively detailed searches based on food type, location, outdoor, pool, price range, ratings, etc. This feature is not available in every country, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri would also answer lots of sports-related questions and it isn't limited to game scores - it does just fine with history, stats, player bios, player comparison, teams, records, etc. Siri should be able to return most of the info right onto its own screen, without switching over to the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same applies to movies. You will get all of your movie-related answers right inside the Siri window - anything about actors, directors, awards, movie stats, premieres and tickets, reviews, trailers, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Your contacts are here<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has been updated with the new iOS borderless look and simple color scheme. The logic behind the phonebook app is completely the same though, so if you've owned an iPad you'll know your way around right away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the phonebook offers Facebook and Twitter integration. After you set up your accounts the phonebook will automatically ask you to link your existing contacts with their social ones (if available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can search via the dedicated Search field at the top of the list of contacts or you can use the alphabetical scroll at the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is intuitive and gives you the option to include lots of additional fields, like several addresses, related people, web, email, birthdays, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set different FaceTime ringtones, iMessage tones and vibration to your favorite contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FaceTime calls from the iPad mini 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>FaceTime comes as a system app in iOS 7. It works both over a cellular data connection or Wi-Fi. The service now offers voice calls too, in addition to video conference chats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With FaceTime audio calls and iMessages, iOS users with a data plan won't need third-party apps such as Viber as much to connect with other iOS users free of carrier charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we've tested the loudspeaker performance of the new iPad mini 2. It matched the Good score of its predecessor. This means you should be able to hear your slate in environments that are not too noisy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 speakers put out a nice sound, but since they are both at the bottom, it's easy to cover them when holding the tablet horizontally and their stereo effect is far from pronounced.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iMessage is neat to have on a tablet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messages app also gets the new iOS skin. It adds a new option in the conversation view - Contact. If you tap on this key, you'll get options to FaceTime (audio or video) that user, or go to their phonebook profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iMessage service lets you exchange instant messages between iOS 5 or later running iGadgets over Wi-Fi or 3G. You can send plain text as well as multimedia (pictures, sounds, videos) messages. A cool thing about the iMessages is that each conversation is synced with the iCloud so you'll have it right there and available on all your iDevices, including your Mac (although synchronization is not flawless and the time stamps would get messed up at times).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty simple - you type, you add content (optional) and hit send. Adding multimedia is done either by hitting the small picture icon next to the text field or through the sharing menu in the gallery or supported apps (Voice Memos, Notes, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Mail client has the new looks but the functionality is unchanged. In portrait mode the left bar with all your emails remains hidden until prompted while in landscape you get both the inbox/emails bar visible and the email you've opened is on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VIP lists are available - emails from people on the list will be delivered to a dedicated VIP mailbox and will appear highlighted in the regular inbox. You can also set a different notification regime for VIP emails - so they appear on the lockscreen, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also flag important emails. After you flag your first message, a new Flagged mailbox will appear gathering all of your flagged emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching pictures and videos while composing an email is possible since the iOS 6 - just tap and hold on an empty space and use the popup menu. Bold, Italic and Underline font styles are available in the text editing options, as well as quote font size levels. Text selection works the usual way (tap&amp;hold and select) and the available options will appear as soon you've made the selection: Cut/Copy/Replace/Bold Italic Underline/Quote Level. Quote Level will increase / decrease the quote symbols before the text you're quoting. Finally there is a built-in dictionary. It's very rich in content and conveniently works offline.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You can type or you can dictate<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Siri-powered dictation is available pretty much in any app that supports keyboard input. You need just to hit the corresponding button on your keyboard and start dictating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard on the iPad mini 2 is exactly the same as on the previous iPads and knows the same tricks. You can undock the keyboard, which places it dead center on the screen. You can then move it up or down, depending on what's underneath and where you would like to place it. You do that by pressing on the keyboard key and dragging in the direction you would like to move the keyboard to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also split the keyboard in two by doing a simple pinch gesture on it or selecting it from the keyboard options. This is especially useful in landscape orientations if you have to type while holding the tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The gallery in iOS7 rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos app has been redesigned more thoroughly. To begin with, the Photos tab looks better organized. Prior to iOS 7 we used to get a grid of all of photos there, sorted by date. Images are now organized by date and location, for those that have been geo-tagged. This view is called Moments, with a description always at the top, with time, place and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moments view offers multiple photos selection - you can select an entire folder with just a single tap. Mass Delete, Share (including AirDrop) and Add To Album options are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go a step back, to Collections view where you can get a better view of your photos, sorted into groups with labels and much smaller thumbs. Those thumbs are still clickable, you can even scroll them to find the one you're looking for (small thumbs are hard to navigate through though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a city label in Moments or Collections will take you to the old Places view, where you get a map with pins showing where exactly your photos were taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Year view. It squeezes your collection into tight grids for each year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is Shared photos - it has all your Photo streams. With Photo Stream you can choose some photos to share and the people they will be shared with. Then the photos will be accessible in a dedicated gallery online at www.icloud.com/photostream/, as well as directly on your friends' iOS devices. Your buddies on the receiving end will be able to like them and post comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the third tab is Albums. You get three default album types - camera roll, my photo stream and panoramas. Albums can be added, edited and deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are displayed in full size and you can delete, share or edit them. From the sharing menu you also get advanced options such as copy, assign to contact, slideshow, print, use as wallpaper and AirPlay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can AirDrop multiple pictures from this interface as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photo editor is the same as before with a new option to add filters. It supports rotation, cropping, filters and red-eye removal. There's also an Enhance option too. In Edit mode five keys appear at the bottom for the available editing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With every new iPad mini 2 you get the powerful editing apps iPhoto and iMovie as free downloads. The iPhoto allows you also to organize your photos by albums, photo books and you can even create journals - collages of photos you can share via iCould and make it visible to anyone. The iPhoto app has richer editing options than the standard gallery. It has been updated finally with the flat iOS 7 skin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the powerful iMovie editor is available for free as well, you just need to download it once you sign in on the AppStore. You can make your own movies and trailers by adding, cutting, merging, etc. videos, songs and pictures. The app is nicely functional and performs excellently on the A7 chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Video player is as lame as ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many things have changed in iOS 7 but the video player is definitely not one of them. You can upload only supported formats via iTunes or purchase videos from the iTunes store. This is an extremely disappointing showing by a platform that is supposed to excel at multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of extra functionality is bad enough, but having to use just an extremely limited number of media format or resorting to converting files, which is both slow and inconvenient is a real deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end the built-in video player is plain useless and users have to resort to using third-party video player apps from the AppStore.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Liten to your music or just stream some with the iTunes Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 music player is exactly the same as the one in iOS 6, but now its appearance is in line with the new iOS design. You can create playlists, delete songs right from within the player and reorder tabs whichever way you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen hasn't changed in functionality neither is the settings. Even in its seventh major iteration iOS still fails to offer configurable equalizers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are logged in with a US Apple ID (the service will roll out in more countries soon), your iOS 7 music player will get an additional iTunes Radio tab. It's a music streaming service with preselected music channels, which don't seem to include the entire iTunes content available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stations are divided by genres, but once you add a station, you can choose to remove artists or add more songs from an artist/group. You can preview a station before adding it to your list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you like a particular song, you can buy it with just one tap. History is available and you can always return to buy songs later. A Wish List is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Radio is ad-free if you are using iTunes Match. Otherwise, every 7 to 10 songs are broken by about 15sec of commercials.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is great, just not Air perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air set the bar for tablet audio output pretty high, but we are still somewhat disappointed that the iPad mini 2 wasn't quite able to match its performance. The more compact of the two new Apple tablets did excellently in our test, but wasn't quite as perfect as its larger sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters its stereo crosstalk was slightly wore in both parts of our test. More importantly, however, the volume levels were far lower than those of the Air. While the full-size iPad was among the loudest we have seen, the Retina-packing mini was below average, which would have been disappointing for a flagship smartphone, let alone a tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the Apple iPad mini 2 did great, delivering output with wide dynamic range and no distortion. The stereo crosstalk was spot-on too, so it still has more than enough to please the vast majority of the users out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Last year camera, good nonetheless<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini 2 keeps the camera from the original iPad mini - a 5MP shooter that can record 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing FaceTime camera has not changed much either, it offers the same resolution, but the sensor size is slightly larger thus offering slightly bigger pixels and hence offering a slightly better low light performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 brings a brand new camera interface with some cosmetic changes (it's flat) and it's more usable. On the iPad mini 2 (as opposed to the iPhone), all the controls are combined in one column - a front/back camera toggle, an HDR toggle and the virtual shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 has three shooting modes you can move between by swiping up and down on the screen. Funnily, you can't just tap their name on screen to pick a mode - you have to swipe. The modes are Video, Photo and Square - there's no panorama, nor is there a 120fps mode like on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Square photographs have, of course, been popularized by Instagram and so have photo effects. That's another thing missing on the iPad mini 2 camera app though, there are no color effects. You do have Photo Booth, which shows a 3 x 3 grid with live preview of the effects, but that's an entirely different application altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera supports AF/AE lock as usual with tap and hold on the viewfinder - this can be of great help with tricky scenes. There's no geotagging on the Wi-Fi only iPads mini, as they don't have a GPS chip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is very good for a 5MP shooter as long as you shoot in good light. Noise is kept well under control until ISO250. Even at ISO320 the level of detail is just fine but the noise quickly starts to get annoying with light levels falling off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white balance is pleasing (it leans slightly towards warm) and the colors are fine except for being slightly less saturated than we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as it was with the iPad Air, the iPad mini 2 has an excellent camera for a tablet - in good light it would take photos that are as good as it gets from a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped an HDR sample with the iPad mini 2 camera. This mode enhances highlights but makes little to no difference in the shadows. Interestingly, in higher ISO photos the HDR mode actually helped reduce image noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're pretty happy with the results as the HDR mode works quickly and seamlessly and helps with the inherently limited dynamic range of minute camera modules such as the ones used on smartphones and tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are also two low light samples, taken by the iPad mini 2 camera at different times around sunrise. You would notice that the darker image has an awful lot of noise, but the second one is perfectly passable for a mobile device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPad mini 2 photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can check out how the iPad mini 2 fares against its predecessor and the iPad Air.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Apple iPad mini 2 in our photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Videos come out really nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2's camera records 1080p video at 30fps, which is the most popular option at the moment, even among smartphones. Note that the front-facing camera doesn't have enough resolution for 1080p, so you'll have to make do with 720p for video selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As seen on the iPhone 5/5s and the iPad Air, the field of view in video capturing mode is less wide than in the still image capturing mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During video recording you can change the focus point and zoom, but there's no option to snap a photo (that option was very limited on the iPhone so we don't miss it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard 1080p videos @ 30fps are captured at a bitrate of 17Mbps, which is about average for Androids too. Most disappointingly, the iPad mini 2 continues to capture mono sound (64Kbps, 44.1kHz) just like its predecessor and the iPhone 5s. Why Apple refuses to do stereo sound in video is beyond us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the video quality is great - that is, if you shoot in broad daylight. The videos come out smooth, noise levels are low and there is a really level of detail. Saturation seems to be fine. There's no pixilation or jumpy continuous autofocus, which are our most common complaints for other mobile cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's more, we're really pleased with the digital image stabilization that the iPad mini 2 offers. With its help, videos come out really smooth. Here is a demo, notice how smooth the panning action is:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In low light, it's a whole different picture. There are annoyingly high levels of noise. Here, check this sample out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Double the Wi-Fi speed and more LTE bands than you can shake a stick at<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini 2 comes in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular options. The latter version supports quad-band GSM, CDMA, quad-band 3G, CDMA200 1x EV-DO, plus a plethora of LTE bands (note that all of these are data-only). The LTE modem in the iPad mini with Retina screen supports all bands needed by carriers simultaneously, so you don't need to worry about which model you have to get (unlike the iPhone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have the Cellular+Wi-Fi device, iOS also supports tethering, but it's up to your wireless carrier whether you'll be able to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both versions of the iPad mini 2 supports dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n (that's 2.4 GHz as well as 5 GHz). Two wifi antennas and MIMO technology can potentially double the data speeds, compared to the original iPad mini. We didn't have the premise to conduct proper Wi-Fi speed tests, but the iPad mini with Retina screen indeed connected to our wireless router at 300Mbps as opposed to the 150Mbps we got from the older iPhone 5 and the original iPad mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP support, but that's hardly any good for data transfers. Apple has never allowed sending and receiving files via Bluetooth like you would do on any other non-Apple device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a new feature in the connectivity department of iOS 7 called AirDrop, a system-wide file sharing service between supported iDevices, which needs to have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned ON to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop is available in every share menu throughout iOS 7. You can send pictures, videos, App Store and iTunes links, Notes, Maps links, all kind of files from file managing apps (i.e. Filer, Flash Drive, Air Disk, etc.), Office docs, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there are people with AirDrop service around you, they will automatically appear in the dedicated AirDrop field. You just mark your files, select the recipients and hit the send key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop won't work with other phones and PCs, but will work on Macs running on OS X Mavericks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regular USB mass storage isn't available but there's a workaround using the iTunes computer software. You can transfer whatever files you want, but those are only made available to the app that you've dropped them onto. Good thing is you are not restricted to files compatible with said app and you can simply drag &amp; drop files that you would download on another computer later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, hardware storage expansion is still off limits in Apple's policy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini 2 Wi-Fi + Cellular has a built-in A-GPS receiver with GLONASS support, but the Wi-Fi only tablet does not (this is standard for iPads).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple is continually improving its Find My iPad service. The latest iOS 7 updates it with the so-called Activation Lock. Once activated, this will not only protect your personal data but also make your iDevice inoperable once wiped, unless you enter your own Apple ID. This means the stolen or lost iGadgets will be of no use to thieves or finders as long as you have Find My iPad setup on your slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud is an integral part iOS since version 5. It syncs all of your important data between all of your devices running iOS 5 or above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get 5GB of free storage but you can buy more if you want. Selecting which apps to sync is pretty easy. iCloud even remembers each device you've backed up so you can restore them separately if you wish. You can naturally delete older backups to free up space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has records on exactly what apps you've purchased, what you have installed on an iDevice and what you've deleted for some reason. Apple keeps tabs on this for each of your iDevices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you chose to sync with iCloud, Apple will sync only the app's personal data, not the entire IPA file (as iTunes did).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is an example: Say, you have Angry Birds installed on your iPhone and it has 1.5MB worth of saved data. Apple will sync only this file. If you delete the game and later install it again (free, from the Purchased list), your iPhone will download the original IPA from the App Store and will get back this 1.5MB file too - a lot more natural to sync the app data rather than keep the entire image. If you use an app as USB storage (Filer or even CineXPlayer), then, by default, the whole content will be backed up too, eating your backup quota quite fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing with the iCloud app sync - when you buy a new app, it will be pushed to all of your iDevices automatically (if available and if you have enabled this feature in the AppStore settings).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The mobile Safari is an excellent browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad mini with Retina screen comes with the latest Safari browser, which is part of iOS7. It has new looks and several new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing you'll notice is the unified search/address field. Just as on today's modern computer browsers, you can enter a search term straight into the browser address bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, you no longer need to use the Back button of the browser. As of iOS7, there is a really nice gesture that can do that instead. A right swipe across the screen but starting offscreen would instantaneously open the previous page that you had opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari finally supports more than 8 simultaneously opened web tabs. The tabs on the iPad's Safari are always visible as opposed to the iPhone, which makes moving between them easier. You can also rearrange the tabs, you can add new ones or switch to private browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you switch to private browsing, you'll need to either close all current tabs or migrate them to Private as well. It's not possible to have private and non-private tabs open simultaneously like in Google Chrome. When you are browsing in Private mode, Safari switches to a dark gray color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, you can also use iCloud to sync tabs between your Safari-running devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you open your History you'll find a new tab called Shared Links (those come from social networking apps, so you'll need one installed). Here you'll find all links from your Twitter timeline, with authors and comments. If you hit the Share button you can bookmark a page if you'll need it long term or add it to the reading list for articles you want to read later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari in iOS 7 supports the iCloud keychain where you can store all of your passwords and credit card info (sans the security code). There is also a password generator available, in case you are out of ideas. What's good about this setup is that all your saved content from the computer version of Safari is now available straight on your phone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like before, if a page is compatible with the integrated Reader (most of the article pages out there are) you get a Reader button right into the address bar as soon as the page loads. The Reader strips the webpage of ads and makes the layout and font size more suited to a smaller screen. And best of all, if you are reading a multi-page article (such as our reviews) getting from one page to the next is automatic as soon as you scroll to the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Safari web browser on the iPad doesn't have a fullscreen mode as the iPhone does. The addressbar and the tabs are always visible both in landscape and in portrait mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple's document editing apps are now free<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple's iWorks suite including Pages, Numbers, and Keynote is available as a free download. The latest versions of the apps have had the iOS 7 makeover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages allows you to import, create or edit documents (DOC and DOCX are both supported). It isn't as powerful as some of its Android counterparts, but it covers all the basics and will do an excellent job for most users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numbers supports viewing and editing XLS and XLSX files and also covers all major features you'll probably need - charts, formulas, tablet formatting, the lot. There are many themes that will help you quickly create complicated spreadsheets even if you don't know how to do a scatter chart (looking at how the templates work is a good way to learn).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Keynote opens and edits (PowerPoint) presentations. It has all the tools you'll need to create a decent presentation from scratch, including tons of beautifully designed themes. You get comprehensive editing options including adding multimedia, tablets, charts and customizable transitions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily import files via iTunes and use iCloud for backup and sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iBooks reading app is another free download courtesy of Apple. It has been freshly redesigned as well, dealing away with the old wooden bookcase design. Despite the new design, which matches the iOS design language, there are no new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While reading e-books may be its most obvious purpose, there's a fully featured e-book store integrated inside the app - the iBook Store. It's choke full of e-book titles (some of which are free). Going further than the concept of reading only digital copies of paper books, Apple has been long working on making publishers create books with iBooks in mind, meaning interactive books, which are conceived for the digital world right from the get go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the reading duties, the app has got pretty much everything covered. You have various font and background settings and there is a independent brightness slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing's for sure. The iPad mini 2 screen seems a great fit for reading. It's just the right size and text looks incredibly sharp on the high-resolution screen no matter the font size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iBooks app is also a PDF viewer, which is one way you can sideload in the app books and magazines that you have already downloaded elsewhere.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The iPad mini makes it easy to check your schedule<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app has been revamped as well and has a very useful new feature. You can now drag and drop events if you want to move them to different days. Just tap and hold on an event, and you can move it to a different day and hour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar benefits greatly from Facebook integration. Birthdays and events from Facebook are immediately synced with your calendar. Other online calendars like Google can also be synced and you have the option to omit them from the Calendars tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view events as a list (iOS's agenda variant) or have aday or month view. There's also a toggle to get back to today if you've strayed too far away. Events are color-coded so you can recognize what's what with a quick glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Events are entered the same way as before. You can choose which calendar you want the event to be synced with, add a location, additional notes and set up an alert.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Calendars tab, you can customize the iCloud personal and job-related event colors to your liking. You can also create additional calendar entries, for example if you have two jobs (or projects), etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reminders interface has been changed as well. It comes with a couple of default lists - Scheduled and Reminders, but you can create your own lists as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up a reminder is easy. The available options are time, place, repeat, priority and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The refreshed Note app has a split screen interface - tap on Notes to bring out a list of all notes in the current account, then tap Accounts to view all accounts. Once you select a note, the side panel automatically hides. You can share, copy and print notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app has got a new skin as well. It has world clock, alarms, stopwatch and a timer. You can set any of the songs in your music library as an alarm tone. You can also choose from your custom ringtones. The world clock shows the time in six locations at once (but you can scroll to reveal more slots) and you get a world map with all the cities, complete with a weather forecast.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple Maps takes care of digital mapping<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has replaced Google with TomTom as the map provider for the iOS native Maps application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've got the Wi-Fi+Cellular version of the iPad mini 2, then it also has a GPS chip inside so you might as well use it for dash-mounted voice-guided navigation. As of iOS 7, the navigation service also includes turn-by-turn walking directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The navigation will work even on the lockscreen or in the background. Real-time traffic reports are available and Apple is also crowdsourcing the live traffic info anonymously from iOS users on the road.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, there isn't an option to pre-cache maps for offline use, which can be a problem if you need guidance abroad or when you don't have signal. Still, if you set up a route when you have internet access, Maps will cache the maps needed to guide you along the way so you can finish your trip even without an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you enable the 3D view (outside navigation) you will be able to explore cityscapes from birds-eye view. The currently available selection is quite limited, but more and more areas are joining Flyover in time. You can zoom, tilt and rotate using two-finger gestures to explore 3D landmarks rendered in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When Apple Maps launched with iOS 6 it was quite a disappointment because of its poor map data, but Apple managed to deal with most of the problems and lack of data and accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you prefer Google Maps, it is available as a free download in the App Store and itis on par with its excellent Android counterpart app. You get voice navigation in regions where available, you can cache maps for offline use, you can use Street View, etc. It's generally, one of the must-have apps even on iOS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Thereare plenty of other apps to discover<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS App Store is still the richest application store to date. It uses a tabbed interface and there are plenty of ways to discover new content. A Featured pages with a carousel showing the top apps is available as well as the usual Charts (Top Paid, Free and Grossing apps), Search and Updates. The Nearby apps tab will help you find the most popular apps people have downloaded around your current location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 brought one more feature that users have been asking for - automatic app updates. Once you turn it on in the App Store settings, your apps will update automatically (via Wi-Fi only) and you'll get notifications for the completed updates in the notification center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual you can view all the apps you've bought on your current or previous iDevice through the Purchased menu in the Update tab. iCloud plays a key part here - all of your purchased apps from each device show up here and are ready for download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Store has a new hidden extra that will be appreciated by those using iTunes gift cards. You can now scan the card codes with you camera right via the App Store interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iTunes store is where you get music, videos, TV shows, movies, podcasts and ringtones. The tabbed interface is similar to that of the AppStore, divided into Music, Movies, Search, Tones and More.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music sync is probably the trickiest part of the iCloud sync. Along with the tracks purchased from the iTunes store you surely have a collection of your own that you sync with your iOS device via iTunes. Apple is also offering a service to sync both collections in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music you've purchased at the iTunes Store will be easy to sync automatically across all your iGadgets. But you will need to use the iTunes Match service for the rest of your music collection if you want it synced too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Match will scan your collection on the computer and check for matches with songs in the Apple's iTunes Store. If there is a match, the iTunes song will be synced, if not - well, Apple will upload this song on their servers and then sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So iTunes scans yours songs and pushes them to all your other devices if they match. If some of your tracks are of lower bitrate than 256Kbps, the iTunes Store will replace them with higher quality (256Kbps). The iTunes Match service costs $25(US) or &#x20ac;25(EU) a year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google offers a similar service for Android - it's called Google Play Music, but it only works in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Game Center has an amazing new look<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Game Center is done with the old looks and we are glad to see it evolve with iOS 7. We love the new looks and its functionality is on par with before. You can see which the most popular gaming titles are, you can see what your friends have last played and you get points for playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Game Center individual apps can tap into your friends' game scores and match them to your own right inside the apps. You can also setup turn-based multi-player games with your friends even if they are not with you and use it to chat with them while in the game. You can also send challenges to friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have no use for the GameCenter functionality, you can disable it by cancelling its login prompt several times - then it will be gone. Otherwise, you can just log on and leave it be without using it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ever since we saw the original Apple iPad mini, we've been hoping for a Retina screen for this wonderful compact tablet. Now that it has it, it's everything we expected it to be. A high-quality screen with immaculate sharpness makes a world of difference and the all-new chipset inside makes sure everything runs equally fast or even faster than before, even faced with the increased demand of the quadruple pixel count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there are many new software features as well, but they are all iOS7-specific so the older mini got them, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini 2 is an excellent compact slate and it left us all happy. It's one of those rare products that's easy to recommend. The iPad mini 2 has been manufactured to amazingly high standards and every single feature that it has works flawlessly and exactly as advertised. Moreover, the Apple AppStore is the richest source of tablet-tailored apps around and that alone promises you long hours of fun. We couldn't possibly find anything to hold against it - expect of course, its price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We know, Apple's products have never been for the price-conscious. To start with, at $399/?389/?319, the iPad mini with Retina screen is already a screamingly expensive piece of gear, as far as compact tablets go. And that's for the Wi-Fi only 16GB version. And 16GB simply don't cut it these days. It is high time Apple makes 32GB the base storage capacity for its new devices (without changing their price points).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On our 16GB review unit, we found ourselves in constant daily shuffle of deleting one app so we can free space for another - and that's even before we uploaded any of our own music and videos to it and before we started recoding 1080p videos with its camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's worse is that the storage upgrades are nothing but a rip-off. Apple is free to set its product base prices as high as it wants. After all, only they know what it costs them to develop, manufacture, sell and support these devices. But charging extra $100/?90/?80 for a mere 16 gigs worth of extra storage is preposterous in times where that kind of money would get you not one, but two 64GB Class 10 microSD cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we got that off our chest, we'll have a look at what else the compact tablet market offers as an alternative to the pricey Apple iPad mini 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, we can't miss to mention the original iPad mini, which would still be available alongside the second generation. It's one of the ways to buy yourself a cheaper access to the amazing tablet apps that the AppStore offers. Prices start at $299/?289/?249 for the 16GB version, but unfortunately there is no 32GB option. The good news for the price-conscious is that the older iPad mini looks just the same and feels even better thanks to its lower weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first gen would also offer much of the same performance in graphic-intensive games as there are 4 times less pixels to push. The bad news, of course, is that the screen is not even close to the new iPad mini. Wi-Fi speeds are also supposedly twice as lower, too, but that's hardly a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad mini Wi-Fi</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving away from Apple's own camp, we end up in Android territory. Android tablet manufacturers have been prolific. This year we are seeing more and more cheap tablets hitting the stores. But the Apple iPad mini deserves better counterparts than those. So we'll only stick to mentioning the top-tier compact tablets running Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And with the mini's screen specs, there is not much competition either. First, there is the latest Google Nexus 7 (2013), which is made by Asus. Then comes the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both weigh about as much as the iPad mini 2, but both have their screens stretch only up to 7 inches in diagonal. The both have the same screen resolution of 1200 x 1920 pixels, which translates into 30%+ less pixels than the mini 2. But since their screens are physically smaller, they offer the same pixel density so they are as sharp as Apple's slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 7 would happily match anything the iPad mini 2 can throw at it and even one-ups it with wireless charging. The Amazon Kindle Fire HDX is a bit more humble in the camera department with its 1.3MP camera and it doesn't have access to the Google Play store either, but you get all the benefits of Amazon's rich content ecosystem. Both cost about the same with prices starting at $229/?229 for the 16GB version, storage upgrade to 32GB worth $40/?40.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Asus Google Nexus 7 (2013) ? Amazon Kindle Fire HDX</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pad 8.3 is also worth mentioning here. It packs the same resolution as the other two tablets, but has it spread a bit thinner on an 8.3" diagonal. Besides, it offers equally competitive specs - it even has a built-in GPS chip which none of the others have, unless you jump for the more expensive Wi-Fi+Cellular versions. It comes with a microSD slot so you can expand the available storage as much as you like. The LG G Pad 8.3 build quality is quite good too, with almost the entire back made out of metal. Price-wise though, the LG G Pad 8.3 is a bit more expensive than the other Android tablets - it costs $349.99/?300.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G Pad 8.3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the price premium of the LG G Pad 8.3 over the two other tablets is nowhere as high as that that of the iPad mini with Retina screen - especially if we only compare the prices of the 32GB version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, there is a reason why Apple can afford to charge such a price premium. And that's the fact that the user experience on the iPad rules.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sheer number of Android sales may already be ahead of the iPad's, but manufacturers still can't get the tablet experience on Android right. Unlike on the 10-inch iPad Air, interacting with iOS7 on the iPad mini 2 doesn't feel as a blown up iPhone, it actually feels just right. In fact, after putting down the new iPad mini, picking up the iPhone 5/5s was not a joyful experience - the screen felt and looked inadequate, shockingly small.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But anyway, it is not an Android tablet that most owners of the original iPad mini are probably considering as an option. They'd most likely stick around and, honestly, they would be right to do so. Apple has a religiously loyal customer base and for a good reason. For those who still have their doubts, we can confirm that the iPad mini with Retina screen is as good as the amazing iPad Air in every possible aspect. What's more, it costs less and the 7.9" screen size is spot-on for enjoying all the apps and content the ecosystem has to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, if you have already decided to part with that sort of cash, the meaningful choice is really between the new iPad mini and the iPad Air. You can go left or right, but never wrong. In fact, picking the mini over the iPad Air seems to make a lot of sense.</paragraph>
