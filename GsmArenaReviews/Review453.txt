			<paragraph>Here is the new flagship of Nokia. Excellent performance, quality dislpay, camera and matt steel body. It is luxurious and beautiful... and you will have to clean it every five minutes. Who will posses it, will be exceptional. Do you want it? Street price of the new Nokia 8800 around 800 euro.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It took Nokia long time - more than two years - until they sat down on the table in the workroom with the sign "8 Series". The 8910i was the last one from the family of the elite mobile phones. In addition, it was not a completely new model, but just an innovation of 8910. None of the mentioned above is still on sale, while the world of successful bosses in luxury limousines already needs another expensive toy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 8910i needed a successor</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>I am exceptional<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new model 8800 is made for celebrities, businessmen, managers, for ordinary people with extraordinary income, virtually for all, who stand for a good style, image and solidity. The package itself doesn't allow you to have doubts about what is hidden inside - something posh. The black boxboard paper, furnished with a metallic clasp with grinded numbers 8800 on it evoked shaking up in the office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   To exclusive phone suits an exclusive packing</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two sections - in the first one a shiny phone and a case, in the second - user's manual, battery, stand, charger and headphones. All in black and silver characters and details if possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The street price for the silver pearl by Nokia is around 800 euro. The expenditure for the production of this exceptional package is nothing for such a sum. The price itself doesn't respect me much, because in Nokia's review I will point out the same drawbacks as I usually point out in any other phone's review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty heavy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The newie is pretty heavy. There was aluminum; there was titanium, now it's time for steel. The whole body is made of steel and the result is the monstrous 134 grams. Be prepared. The dimensions, however, will compensate you - height 107 and width 45 milimetres is nothing unusual. The thickness, however which is only 15 mm in the narrowest places, attacks Motorola Razr V3. The sliding contruction increases the effect of paper flatness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Nokia 8800 in the official pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The new Nokia certainly doesn't belong amongst the fat ones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I am hesitating whether to appreciate the extra weight of 8800 as a negative or a positive feature. There are people at least, who need to know that they have something in their hands. On the other side, we talk about a phone, which most of the time will rest in the shirt pockets of many managers. In any case, this is a luxury tax for the used luxury materials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The steel elegance weighs something...</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A lighter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone looks very compact and firm when closed. The matching is perfect. Shortly after the first contact you'll discover one of its biggest drawbacks - you will succeed in leaving your fingerprints on the body of the phone. Besides, in the package there is a black leather case, which has an excellent cleaning ability. In addition its opening is pretty narrow so that every removal means also its partial clean-up. Sometimes, however it's not enough and you have to clean the dabs from your cheeks by yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 is a phone with sliding construction and it takes a while for everyone, who holds it in his hands for the first time to realize how the opening mechanism works. You have to push down the cogged roller, which looks like a scroll button. At first you won't even think about it. When you get over the spring resistance the upper part of the phone is already "flying".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When opening the keyboard, you'll hear a sound, just similar to the one, you know from the opening and closing of Zippo lighters. Metal is metal. The phone opening tool is very precise and pleasant; I have caught myself opening and closing it all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Cogged roller works like a prop for fingers when opening ? the construction is first class </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two batteries in the package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Thanks god we didn't borrow this sample of Nokia 8800 like the first one. Someone else before us obviously had confused the back cover of the battery with a yoghurt lid and tried to "unstick" it. He didn't only make some scratches on the metal back of the phone, but had twisted the back cover and couldn't manage the classic release by the two side long buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  In order to remove the back cover is enough to push the two side long buttons  noviná?)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  A view from the back cover</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Behind the cover you'll find a battery, especially made for 8800. It has a BL-5X sign and is very small. However we face a lower capacity in comparison with the ones we have used to. According to the manufacturer 600 mAh is enough for approximately 8 days of stand-by and up to 180 minutes talk time. In practice the steel phone usually endures short time. Not much of a problem, because in the package you'll find a second battery of the same type.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Detailed accessories<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may charge your telephone in a beautiful metal stand. After the plugging its frame illuminates with a beautiful blue light. Together with the phone, you may put in the charger another battery too, in order to take it directly with you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The table charger may charge the phone and the spare battery at the same time</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have already mentioned the cleaning and transport pouch. Another thing, delivered with the phone is a handsfree. It has a quality sound and the appearance corresponds to the one of 8800. The receiver, however, doesn't suit very well in the ear and the microphone fastener is too thick. Moreover, the accepting and ending conversation button doesn't work precisely and you have to guess whether you have pushed it or not. I think that wireless headphones would better suit such a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The elegant headphone delivered with the phone ? the illuminating charger edges</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>High resolution display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display is virtually similar to the one of  6230i. It has the same size - 30 × 30 mm and the same resolution of 208 × 208 pixels. Higher is the number of colors, which has grown to 262K.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the picture is very smooth, fine and rather contrast. It's a pleasure to the eye. It's a pity that the font color may be changed only for the main stand-by display, but not for the whole menu. We don't have a chance to go trough the menu comfortable in case of dark wall-papers. You just couldn't see some descriptions. The display is protected by a hardened glass, which you can't scratch just like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   You may change the font color in the main display ? in the menu you can't </paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The display is protected by a hardened glass ? the display has high quality ? the key lightning is blue white  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is plastic. It has a strong enough blue-white lightening. You don't have to wrap your thumb unpleasantly due to its high position. The keyboard is very ergonomic. Well, the buttons are placed where other phones usually have display and this is due to the protrusion. The functioning of the keys is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The keyboard is hidden under a metal cover </paragraph>
			<paragraph>It took me some time to get used to the fact, that the context keys are mounted straight to the protruding roller, therefore are not part of the keyboard. At the beginning I often pushed the conversation operating buttons. There are two blind positions on the keyboard, which suit very well to the structure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  I wonder where might be the context keys. ...next to the supporting roller </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The asterisks and the cross on the lower row don't work very well; the upper arrow of the main operating key, too. The confirming button is tiny and you may push all four directions at the same time. So, you have to use a fingernail. After some days working the left context keys had began annoyingly to get loose. I would feel very angry because of this fact, if I had given 800 euro for it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You won't scratch it when it's closed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the phone is closed, you may accurately accept conversations or identify its ringing, or receive text messages. Nothing more. I would embrace the idea of the drawing out mechanism handled in other way and the roller in the center - a real scrolling button. You won't even find volume control on the sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   It's true that the roller is not rotating ... ? there are no buttons on the phone sides</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing you can still use is the main switch button, its follow-up pressing allows you to list among profiles; a long press confirms the choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The switch button on the upper edge </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversations with Nokia 8800 have high quality sound. There's enough bass and the voice is very clear. There is an option of sound improvement activation in the menu. I can't imagine one who will not use this function, why there is an option to switch it off?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next drawback is the lack of the classic Pop-Port. On the lower side you'll find only a classic charger connector and a minijack socket. The handsfree output is monaural too. Over and above, the delivered headphone is nothing special. When you want to listen to the radio, you must have it connected to the phone - it serves like an antenna. Then, you may listen to a loud speaker. According to everything mentioned, the radio and MP3 player must get the stereo output only trough Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Connector on the lower edge</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Icons without innovation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The promotion of the phone in April was accompanied by info about the especially modified appearance of the menu. I was very surprised to find out the same performance like Nokia 6230i when I switched the phone on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The main menu with big icons </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The function of the context keys may be modified. By default the left one has the "go to" function and you may choose the function of the right one. You may set every one of the four directions of the main button with some of the menu functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may set the phone to display the main menu with big icons or order it like 3 × 3 matrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu, organized like matrix</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Exclusive ringtones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone has memory for 1000 contacts. You can use the entries stored in the SIM card memory and on the phone's memory at the same time. You may add five types of phone numbers to every contact - the first one may be set like default, additionally you may change the indication of the primary number. After this come the email and web addresses, mailing address, user's ID, picture and notice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Look at the contact ? items, which can be added to contacts </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't set ringtones to individual contacts, they can be assigned to groups only. The phonebook may be displayed like a classic name list, name list with numbers or like names with associated photographs. You may set even hundred photos to the contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Display the phonebook option ? the list of groups</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an option to create up to 25 contact groups. Every name could be in more than one group and to every group you may set ringtone and picture. The photos, however, won't have priority to those which you have already assigned to individual names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ryuichi Sakamoto has composed the ringtones for the new Nokia. I must confess that I don't have any idea who is he. Definitely it doesn't sound to me very exclusive, as well as the melodies themselves. The oriental sound will suit some people for sure, the cymbals however don't correspond much with most of the world and what's more - the speaker can't reproduct some sounds correct. Anyway, the objective is achieved - you'll be different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The titles of some ringtones talk about themselves </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Writing messages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are changes in the predictive T9 dictionary compared to 6230i. I have to say that there's no problem anymore with the writing of basic words, such as "Nokia", "yes", "go". You may enter about 150 messages in the shared phone memory. The phone works well with SMS and MMS, email and Instant Messaging. Text messages may be six parts long, the countdown begins from the first sign. MMS messages can't exceed the size of 300 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   SMS creation</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client works with POP3, SMTP and IMAP4 protocols, but it has just basic functionality. You can't attach full resolution photos, the phone cuts them automatically to 195 × 156 pixels. This is unusable. The emails are downloaded completely, not only the headers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also adjust specific tones to the messages, which you won't find in other phones. These settings are part of the profile. What is new and interesting - the profiles transfer option according to the attached accessories. In practice this is functioning in such a way: you put 8800 in the table charger, it switches to the adequate profile.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The hidden half megapixel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The fixed camera of Nokia 8800 is on the sliding part, so when you have the phone closed, the optics is protected. For such an expensive phone the 640 × 480 pixel resolution may be low, while megapixel cameras demand a lot of space. So the result is a compromise and a resolution of 800 × 600 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera at the back side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photo settings are few - no color balance, forget about exposure compensation. There is 4x digital zoom in two steps and you can choose from the four types of resolution and three types of picture quality. The pictures are stored in JPEG format. At disposal there is a night mode too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos are of a medium quality. The text shots don't come well, the tree leaf also. The color is relatively good; the big problems come with the unclouded sky and the harsh sun. This you can see best on the photos of standing automobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 8800 sample photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can make video clips in 3GP format with 176 × 144 pixel resolution. The video duration seems to be limited only by the space in the phone memory - at the beginning I've been proposed more than an hour record.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>MP3 - yes, but you won't enjoy it very much<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a universal media player in the phone menu. You'll find also a music player. In practice it doesn't differ much from the usual classic player and works with MP3 and AAC formats. You may create your own play lists; there is a simple equalizer with different choices - rock, pop...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Multimedia menu ? sound settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The playback can be random or repeated. There is a way to play all music records available in the phone. In this case the phone looks in the music files folder, so you have to put all MP3 files here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The playback quality is quite high, but however can't reach the quality of classic MP3 players or Sony Ericsson W800 for example. Delightful is the option of functioning player while scrolling around trough phone's menu and working with it normally. The songs will follow according to the positioning of the playlist; in stand-by mode the names are alternating together with the date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I have already indicated that it's a great pity that the connector is only minijack type, so you cannot connect classic headphones. The enclosed handsfree is good for calling, but is not enough for listening to quality music. Nokia obviously expects that the client, who can afford such a phone wouldn't care about quality listening of MP3 from the phone. He would buy himself a classic player instead. Especially about the mentioned Sony Ericsson W800 we can see that such a decision is not the right one at all. On the other side is the fact that 8800 doesn't have a memory card slot, so the usage of the music player would not be frequent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Universal headphones are not delivered with the phone, only one of the ears would be pleased</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notice: In order to avoid the frequently aksed questions about the operating of Nokia 8800 as a MP3 player, I will explain it right away.The Nokia 8800 has 64 MB of total integrated memory; the real amount of memory which can be used for music files is under 50 MB, not really enough for a MP3 player. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle><subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The radio is the same as in the ex-models of Series 40, no changes are made. You may store up to 20 stations; the automatic search is working reliable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What am I going to do this weekend?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may store five types of events in the calendar - meetings, calls, birthdays, memos and reminders. A memo can be up to 160 signs. You may set an automatic delete operation according to the time; you may set repeating events. The records are displayed according to the choice in a monthly, weekly or daily view. You may choose the day which the calendar week begins with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Calendar with reminders</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer offers a To-do application also. You may set the desired items in a low, normal or high priority and check off the tasks after execution. Next are the notes. They can be 3000 symbols long; hardly anybody will use this capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> To-do list</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock won't disappoint you even when the phone is turned off. It offers snooze function with custom setting of the delay. You may be waken up by a classic ring, radio or by your favourite MP3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The classic stopwatch, countdown timer and calculator are parts of the menu. You'll find three games in the applications - Street Race competition, the grassy Golf Tour and the intellective Chess. Here is also a currency converter, an option of displaying the time zones in the world cities and a plain dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Example with the prepared games</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end I will mention the dictaphone, which you can use also for recording a running conversation. It is limited to the completely satisfactory 60 minutes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Class 8 only<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The internet browser allows browsing simple web sites. The phone can be used as a modem and you can connect to the internet trough it. I am sorry to say - only trough Bluetooth. Data speeds are not the best ones, which the Finns could offer. Nokia 8800 supports EDGE, but together with GPRS the two technologies are Class 8. I can't figure out a rational reason why Class 10 has not been implemented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pack PC Suite is prepared for synchronization with a PC, which besides with the organization units and the address book can also work with logos, melodies and pictures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Created for a special target group<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 8800 is a phone very similar to the 6230i model. The Nokia models leader is based above all on design, exceptionality and exclusiveness. I must add that 8800 met the expectations to the last word.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new owner may be sure that he will rarely meet another one with the same phone in his hands. Shortly after, he might regret only for the reason that Nokia didn't finalize some details for a full satisfaction. Such as - the lack of memory card, the need of non-stop cleaning of the metal body and the slides, the lack of good handsfree and the lack of system connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The current price of 8800 is 800 euro. You can be sure that there won't be massive price cuts like Motorola did with their Razr V3. Nokia 8800 will keep its price, this is the wish of the manufacturer, the exclusiveness will back up on and there will be no change. The previous Nokia models of this class didn't wait the sellouts in the supermarkets. So everyone who wants exclusiveness, take 800 euro with you and go to the shop. For all the rest 6230i will be enough.</paragraph>
