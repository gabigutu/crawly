			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 Pixon gets its kick from touchscreen and imaging and hopes to be the definitive cameraphone. The inspired TouchWiz interface and massive screen are the right gateway to getting the 8 megapixel camera and real high-end video unleashed. The Pixon obviously plays second fiddle to the INNOV8 in the Samsung portfolio but dares to challenge it in the imaging department. Picture this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon clearly belongs to one of the two schools of thought in the Samsung 5 to 8MP cameraphone sample. There the ironclad Soul-flavored devices rub shoulders with the huge touchscreens of the Tocco line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pixon humbly gives the smart INNOV8 a bow of respect and suffices with topping the line of full-touch and multimedia gadgets. Now, given our admiration for the F480 Tocco, the Pixon can count on a fair and respectful welcome but that won't make us soft or too forgiving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, even if 8MP cameraphones are still rather exotic, there seems to be enough competition to motivate the M8800 to squeeze out its best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We feel it's only fair to start with LG. Not only because Samsung are just about starting to come close to the high video recording bar of the groundbreaking Viewty. It's also worth observing the different approach of compatriot makers. While Samsung choose to share their 8MP efforts between a Symbian all-in-one and a touchscreen, LG have more of a crossover gadget in the face of Renoir. LG KC910 Renoir is a pumped-up version of the Pixon, closing in on the INNOV8 by adding Wi-Fi. Other than that, the Renoir and the Pixon are almost identical save for a tad smaller screen on the LG handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KC910 Renoir</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If imaging is your thing you should definitely take a look at Samsung i8510 INNOV8. It surely won't go easy on your wallet but, again, it has the best camera we've seen to date on a mobile phone. Furthermore, it rides on the vast capabilities of Symbian, which might seem a fair trade for touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i8510 INNOV8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, should touchscreen make you tick and budget be tighter, the Viewty is still out there and eager to please (also available in 3G-less version as KE990). While not an 8MP unit, its capable camera is a perfectly adequate sub in most cases. Been around quite some time now, the Viewty is way easier with the price tag than the latest releases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KU990 Viewty</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other more affordable alternatives include Samsung F480 and Samsung F490 (both 5 megapixel touchscreens) and LG KF750 Secret (with limited touchscreen functionality). The exotic dual-SIM Samsung D980 is in an entirely different league but also promises some nice 5 megapixel shooting power. All those alternatives obviously do not count for the people that really need the extra 3 megapixels but we doubt it there's too many of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung F480 ? LG KF750 ? Samsung D980</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make it all the more crowded, Sony Ericsson also make a bid for domination of the 8MP realm with the Sony Ericsson C905. It's a feature phone mostly by name with GPS and Wi-Fi on the spec sheet. Our final two offerings dwell in the land of Windows Mobile. The Samsung i900 Omnia and HTC Touch HD both have touchscreens and 5 megapixel cameras. While their target audience is worlds apart from the one of Samsung M8800 Pixon they are still worth mentioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson C905 ? Samsung i900 Omnia ? HTC Touch HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, it must be enough of a warm-up with the roll of Samsung M8800 Pixon alternatives. Let's now take the jump to unboxing and exterior.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Samsung M8800 Pixon doesn't really spell high-end. Inside the relatively small box you will find a stylus to be hung on the lanyard eyelet, a two-piece wired headset and a DC charger. The handsfree set has a 3.5mm standard audio jack, which means you can easily replace the included headphones with ones of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This stylus solution, as we've repeatedly pointed, is quite inconvenient and basically means that most users will probably do without it. It wasn't too much of a problem with the LG KU990 Viewty, and it shouldn't be with the Pixon either, but why did they bother including it in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the fact that our Samsung M8800 Pixon retail package had no paperwork makes us think it might not be its final version. Besides, those packages have always been strongly market dependent, so you should take our example with a pinch of salt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 05 Dec: Things do look a little different with the final version of the retail package that we received. The additional load packs a 1GB microSD card, a Samsung PC Studio CD and finally, a user manual. There are no other changes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung M8800 Pixon 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 Pixon stands at 107.9 x 54.6 x 13.8 mm or at least this is what the manufacturer says. However, upon a careful caliper measurement, the Pixon scored 14.5mm at its slimmest part. This still is acceptable but 0.7mm thicker than the official spec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just for the sake of comparison the LG KC910 Renoir is advertized as being 14mm thick, but our measurement proved that it's in fact 14.7mm in its slimmest part, so there you have it, Samsung Pixon is still the slimmest 8 megapixel handset out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now before you jump to some conclusions that our measurement is consistently flawed by 0.7mm, let us just say that we did the same measurement of both the Apple iPhone and the Nokia N95 8GB and their thickness turned out EXACTLY as advertized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That being said, we have to point out that it has become a habit for Samsung (and for LG) to measure their phones' thickness at the slimmest parts instead of the thickest. While in the case of the LG Renoir it's only the camera lens that sticks out, in the Samsung Pixon is both the really large camera lens and the grip at the back of the device. So as a result, Samsung Pixon leaves a rather bulky impression and the quoted thickness of 13-14mm is nothing but marketing smoke. Have that in mind when you read those specs aloud next time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 Pixon is nonetheless pocketable even if the weight of 121 g doesn't exactly put it in the strawweight category.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The huge touchscreen doesn't leave too much space for creativity in design, but somehow the Pixon falls short of the seamless Apple iPhone or the sleek HTC Touch HD design. The digicam-styled back though creates an awareness of the handset's main intent. The projecting nest of the lens and bulging rubbery camera-style grip at the bottom do mean business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only a single color version of the M8800 Pixon announced at this stage. If the demand turns out sufficient Samsung might come up with some new editions (white comes to mind - just kidding!) but black is all you get for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of keys and controls on the Samsung M8800 Pixon is quite impressive for a touchscreen phone. For starters there are three hardware keys under the large display that takes most of the front. The Call and End buttons are on either side of a round back button. On the other end of the phone's face we see the video-call camera, ambient light sensor and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The round black button is used as a Back key throughout the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Pixon hosts the microSD card slot, the Shortcuts menu key and the Hold key. The latter is used for locking (and unlocking) the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is quite plain, featuring the lanyard eyelet and the mouthpiece only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top is where the proprietary connectivity port is located. The other thing of interest here is the battery cover release button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving to the right side, we come upon the dedicated camera key, gallery key and a volume rocker/zoom control. All those are self-explanatory, so we doubt it there is much to tell you about them. As far as their size and ergonomics are concerned - the keys on the Pixon are small and discreet but nicely tactile and responsive. The shutter key is notable for offering fairly distinct half-press and full-press for the amazingly short travel it has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of Samsung M8800 Pixon features the 8 megapixel autofocus camera which - when not in use - lies under an automatic protective cover. Its low-light performance is helped by the included LED flash but you probably shouldn't set your hopes too high. The LED flash isn't great for night photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other item of interest here is the loudspeaker grill, placed on the side of the lens nest and forming a nice symmetrical pattern with the LED flash. The rubbery bulge at the bottom of the rear acts as a proper digicam grip. It's also level with the projecting lens nest and that prevents wobbling of the handset when laid on its back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the all-metal battery cover is a breeze thanks to the release latch at the top. Fitting it back in place is a little fiddly but not much of a burden. You will hardly need to do it often enough to make this an issue anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the cover hides the 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery quoted at 3 hours and 40 minutes of talk time or 290 hours in standby. While this might not sound too unsettling you will probably end up charging your phone every other day even when using it sparingly. This isn't much of a problem to us but some users have the right to disagree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build of Samsung M8800 Pixon is fine and the materials used suggest adequate durability. They don't by any means yell expensive but hopefully the price tag will reflect that.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display looks good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3.2" display of Samsung M8800 Pixon is capable of showing up to 256K colors and sports WQVGA (240 x 400 pixels) resolution. Picture quality is commendable with very good brightness levels and pretty decent contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is also steadily improving over recent Samsung handsets. With the M8800, use in broad daylight is no longer the kind of issue it used to be with the Samsung i900 Omnia for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen sensitivity is quite good. The phone is very responsive and provides satisfying haptic feedback. In addition, vibration intensity can be modified to best suit the user taste. The screen can also be calibrated for spot-on touch accuracy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface alive with color<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface is an improved version of what we saw in Samsung F480, which we did like. The TouchWiz is lively, colorful and very well behaved. Quick and responsive, and nicely thumbable - it makes the stylus essential for handwriting recognition only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen of the Pixon offers the typical Samsung layout. The top bar is reserved for standard readings like signal strength, battery status, network connectivity, ringing profile etc. As far as the rest of the display is concerned, it is entirely up to the user to decide what should be there and what not. Furthermore, widgets allow a whole lot wider customization and improve user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are basically a very convenient way for customizing your home screen. Some of the widgets are more practical such as the calendar or the world clock, while others are just for fun such as the image gallery or the Fun Club logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the widgets are stored on a bar on the left which you can reveal or hide by using the small arrow in the upper left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick which ones to display, by simply dragging them onto the display and placed where you want. If any is to be removed, all you need to do is drag it back to the bar. You can also use some of the icons straight from the widget bar (such as the calculator).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the TouchWiz, the Pixon menu structure isn't greatly different from other Samsung handsets. The only major difference is the added tab at the bottom of the display, which holds three of four keys with varying functionality according to the currently selected menu. There are also great animations used for the transitions and the other actions around the menu (selecting, scrolling).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a 4 x 3 grid of icons. Sub-menus appear as lists. The much contested feature of all recent Samsung phones, whereby the last used items are highlighted by default when you open a submenu, is also present here. With this touch-operated handset there is almost no difference what exactly is highlighted by default. Still, on some rare occasions when accessing longer lists this might save you some scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice novelty in the UI of Samsung M8800 Pixon is the multitasking. The phone allows the Java applications to be minimized and run in background in a way similar to the Sony Ericsson non-smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are very pleased with the speed and responsiveness of the handset. Its whole interface is really snappy with no noticeable lags anywhere. The main menu is accessible from the stand-by display by pressing the right key on the tab at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Limited customization options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 Pixon doesn't offer too many customization options for its UI. In fact the only possible modification is changing the active wallpaper and rearranging the standby screen, thanks to the widgets. The only other thing to modify is font.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is virtually no way of changing the icon appearance or the menu view mode. There are no extra themes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: no reasons to grudge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Samsung M8800 Pixon can store up to 2000 contacts with multiple fields. Those aren't as many as some other manufacturers can offer but we doubt it anyone will ever need more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The names from either the SIM card or the phone memory can be displayed, or both can appear simultaneously. The contacts can than be ordered by either first or last name. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different information fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 4 email addresses, URLs and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone (audio or video) and picture, as well as a note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be organized into groups, which can then have their own ringtones and pictures. Contact details or your whole phonebook can be sent via Bluetooth, email or text message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log application keeps track of latest calls. Both the Call key in stand-by and the call log icon from the menu give you access to the application. It has four tabs - dialed numbers, received and missed calls and all combined. Finally, there are also data and call time counters and even a call cost feature can be enabled if you provide information about your subscription plan.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and speakerphone performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 is very good at its main job - making calls. There are no issues with the voice quality on either end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dialing with Samsung M8800 Pixon is almost as plain as it can get (save for the fact that the 12-key alphanumeric pad is on the screen). We would have preferred some sort of smart dialing to facilitate accessing your phonebook entries but not this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the loudspeaker performance, here is how the Pixon ranks alongside some of the other devices we have tested. You can find more details about the test itself, as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Key-less Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might have expected, Samsung M8800 Pixon handles all common message types. The handset has a shared editor for SMS, EMS, MMS and a separate one for emails. A rich T9 dictionary is at the user's disposal too. In case message sending fails, the message is automatically saved to the outbox, so you can try sending it later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the F480, the Pixon offers a choice of three different input methods. The first is a 12-key standard phone keypad that takes about half the screen. The keys are all large enough but typing on touchscreen is usually not the best experience. Haptics help but are still short of the solid press feedback of regular keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When keypad input is selected and the phone is rotated, a full landscape QWERTY keyboard appears. Its keys are not as large as the 12-key keypad but if you have the stylus at hand it is a whole lot faster to type. Besides, with some training you will probably be able to cope without the stylus. It is also important to note that unlike the LG KC910 Renoir the full QWERTY keyboard is available in the java applications as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final inputting mode is handwriting recognition. You can opt between writing all across the screen, on half of it or in four boxes. Three of the boxes handle letters while numbers and symbols belong in the fourth. Keeping to those restrictions might not be the easiest around but it certainly improves recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like you can also activate a delivery report for the SMS and EMS. MMS can have a preset size limit of either 30, 100 or 300 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is room for 500 SMS, 30 push messages and 200 broadcast messages in Samsung M8800 Pixon. As far as emails and MMS are concerned, they are not limited in number and storage depends on the free memory only. There is normally plenty of space available for those, as the built-in memory is 200 MB. Incoming messages, like calls, can be blocked based on a user-defined black list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is very good. It can manage multiple accounts - POP or IMAP; download is user-defined, opting between headers only and entire messages. SSL and TLS security protocols are also supported so no worries there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not only any files from the phone memory, but also business cards, calendar events, tasks or notes can be emailed as attachments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Samsung M8800 Pixon also features an improved version of the SOS message feature. It allows you to quickly send one to five SOS messages to up to 5 predefined numbers. The message text can also be customized. After setting up the feature, all you need in case of an emergency, is to press the volume rocker 4 times with the touchscreen locked to send your cries for help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new thing is that if any of the numbers on your SOS list should try to call you back upon receiving the message, their call will be automatically connected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management is good enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8800 Pixon file browser is somewhat different from the one found on Samsung F480. It can display the files and folders from the phone memory or the memory card, and even both at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for different types of files - images, video, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. However, you are not forced to follow this structure and may place you files as you wish. There will be no problems handling them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the file browser is one of the best we have seen among non-smartphones. You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (save for the root ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth and email, one by one or in bulk. Throughout the whole file manager, you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion. Reading from the memory card is fast enough and won't bother users at all. Listing the thumbnails of pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card now happens very quickly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo Browser joins the Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8800 has two different picture galleries. Both of them are optimized for touch operation and are rather user-friendly. The first is an inherent part of the file manager and accessing it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This gallery has two view modes. In fact those are available throughout the whole file manager but opting between them is only reasonable when browsing pictures. The list view displays files as a list, with a really small thumbnail next to each filename and is able to fit 7 items on screen. The thumbnail view shows a grid of 5 x 4 thumbs with small captions under each denoting its filename. You can sort your images (or any other files for that matter) by date, type, name, and size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep you fingers across the screen to see the next images without having to return to the image list. The sweeping is relatively responsive, but the Apple iPhone and the LG Renoir have got it more fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next you can alternate portrait and landscape modes by rotating the phone thanks to the built-in accelerometer. You can also zoom in on a picture to see greater detail. Zooming is quite slow the first step but then its speed improves and panning is perfectly OK.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alternative of the picture gallery is PhotoBrowser. It has its dedicated icon in the main menu and is the quickest way of accessing you images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling images in the Pixon gallery follows alphabetic filtering by default. It seems pretty out of place, as all file names of photos produced by the camera start with the letter "P" - as in "Photos".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, you can opt for some other filters such as the usual "by date" or the more intriguing "by color". The Face Link option allows you to sort your images by the people appearing on the photos. To use that you have to "name" the people on the photos with the help of the gallery face-recognition feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both galleries have slideshows and another nice accelerometer-based feature. It lets you browse pictures in fullscreen landscape mode by simply tilting your phone to its sides.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Touch-friendly music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of Samsung M8800 Pixon has also been improved and optimized for touch operation. It has better looks although the functionality isn't changed compared to other Samsung devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player widget is cool, allowing quick access to the full version of the application by a single tap only. You can also start, stop and alternate tracks straight from the home screen if you prefer. A well deserved pat on the shoulder also goes to the FM radio widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a number of sound effects available when playing a track. From surround, dynamic sound and the usual equalizers (rock, jazz etc.), it's all there with Samsung M8800 Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Pixon allows touch-performed fast forwarding and rewinding. This adds up to a worthy music player application, which can fully replace your portable music player. The generous 200MB of internal storage and the memory card slot are also important here and the great audio quality, which we will discuss in a little while, plays a significant role.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio supports RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 Pixon features an FM radio with RDS. The RDS itself is the same advanced type we saw on Samsung F480. It displays the station name on one row and the additional information on the other. Furthermore, the Samsung M8800 Pixon radio offers intuitive controls and it even has an integrated music recognition feature much like Sony Ericsson's TrackID. We tried it once and it had no problem returning the right result for us.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player: higher res videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is another noteworthy application. It has nice touch optimized interface and all the essentials are covered. It can play video files in fullscreen landscape mode and you can fast-forward and rewind videos. You can also rewind or fast forward your videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are really glad that, unlike the F480, Samsung Pixon has no problem playing VGA or even WVGA videos at 30 fps. Not that it's a great surprise, as the phone itself captures such videos, but it is a nice upgrade over the Tocco nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should also mention that the Samsung Pixon has support for XviD and DivX videos. Truth be told we got a video or two rejected due to "too high bitrate", which otherwise played just fin on the LG Renoir.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Pixon audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 Pixon passed our audio quality test with an ease, except in one obviously weak area. We can't overlook the disastrous stereo crosstalk reading, which is among the worst we have seen, but the rest of the numbers are excellent with good dynamic range and noise levels, and distortion well under control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is also on the better side of the handsets we've tested. There is some kind of low-pass filter for the lowest frequencies but we have seen far worse. Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixels worth of camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're now at a Samsung M8800 Pixon landmark - the 8MP autofocus camera. It is capable of taking photos with a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. The LED flash is rather inadequate and you shouldn't probably count on it too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The automatic lens cover is more than welcome. The camera also has a number of nice built-in features including the Samsung proprietary wide dynamic range option, the anti-shake digital image stabilization, geotagging and viewfinder gridlines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch optimized and is surely one of the most comfortable camera interfaces on a touchscreen device so far. In addition, the camera speed is simply impressive. Saving an 8MP photo only takes about a second and with the automatic preview turned off the shot to shot time is truly remarkable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of Samsung M8800 Pixon is good but it falls behind the other 8 megapixel cameraphones. There are some high noise levels and somewhat low level of detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 05 Dec: The retail version of the M8800 Pixon fares much better than our first unit in terms of image quality. The noise levels are now kept under better control and the level of detail is only a tad below the best in class. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the colors are very precise and there are no traces of oversharpening. The contrast levels are also quite good, producing vibrant pictures without loosing too much detail due to highlight or shadow clipping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 05 Dec: Here go the sample photos from our retail M8800 Pixon that should give you an exact idea of how it performs in reality. For a better impression of how much it has improved over the pre-release version we had at the time of writing we have compared it alongside the two leading 8 MP cameras as far as image quality is concerned - the Samsung i8510 INNOV8 and the LG KC910 Renoir. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 05 Dec: These comparative photos once again confirm our initial observations. The Samsung M8800 Pixon has very good contrast levels and together with the INNOV8 much better color accuracy than the LC KC910 Renoir. Furthermore both Samsung handsets have none of the excessive sharpening artifacts that are easily visible on the LG KC910 Renoir photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the negative side the amount of detail captured by the Pixon is still lower than those of the competitors but the gap ain't that big. The noise levels have been so drastically improved so that they are now the best of the lot. We do suppose that a more aggressive noise-reduction algorithm is the reason for the somewhat less detail (and less noise of course).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Spectacular video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 Pixon is among the first devices to feature D1 (or otherwise known as WVGA) video recording at 30fps. While the first handset to feature that - the LG KC550 - was far from impressive for interpolating some of the frames, the Pixon is quite a complete video recording device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out a sample video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8800 Pixon can also do slow motion videos as it is able to capture QVGA resolution at 120fps. No longer the novelty it used to be back with the LG Viewty, slow mo videos are a nice little perk to have at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, our unit had some issues with that video mode so we won't be publishing samples of those.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS receiver<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 Pixon also comes with a built-in GPS receiver. Unfortunately, for some reason, the Google Maps application that came preloaded on our unit was unable to detect the built-in unit. It might be a unit specific thing but user reports suggest otherwise. This means that unless you install some third party software the GPS is only good for geo-tagging with the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We resorted to the free Mobile GMaps application which was able to make full use of the internal GPS. It still doesn?t offer voice-guided navigation but this is as high as java applications go. In addition MGMaps is fully capable of utilizing the touchscreen capabilities of the handset making it one of the best that the Pixon users can get.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: Wi-Fi, anyone?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M8800 Pixon is a true world player as it has support for all the four GSM bands. The same doesn't hold true for 3G, where all you have is the 2100MHz band (which is still the most popular one in Europe).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100Mhz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should definitely check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Samsung M8800 Pixon you can count on 3G with HSDPA and GPRS for browsing internet on the go. EDGE is also present as a handy back-up for browsing in areas where 3G network is missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the network connectivity options, Samsung M8800 also offers USB and Bluetooth connectivity. Upon connecting a USB cable, three modes are available to choose from (PC Studio, Windows Media Player sync and Mass Storage). You can also opt for the handset prompting mode select on connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The significant connectivity feature that Samsung M8800 Pixon lacks is Wi-Fi. When F480 was released this was hardly a surprise for a non-smartphone but times have changed. LG KC910 Renoir and Sony Ericsson C905 are changing the rules and Samsung better follow. The lack of Wi-Fi might not be a deal breaker for too many people now but it may become one in half an year or so.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser flies high<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 Pixon, much like the Samsung F480, features a great web browser, which makes web surfing a really enjoyable experience. Except for a few minor problems here and there, the browser is truly worth the praise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser renders pages greatly in both portrait and landscape modes. The browser switches between both modes seamlessly when you rotate the handset in landscape position. The available fullscreen mode makes great use of the 3.2" WQVGA display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing we really liked in the web browser is the use of the volume rocker for changing page size. The sharp performance of that feature got approving nods in the first place. Even when reduced to the smallest size most of the text remains readable and that allows you to fit much more content on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can scroll around by simply sweeping a finger across the screen. The actual scrolling action is quite smooth, similar to the Apple iPhone implementation. Pages scroll in the opposite direction of your finger-sweep, as if you are actually pushing it aside.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung M8800 Pixon has a number of useful time-managing applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. You can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday. However, with Samsung M8800 there is only a single type of event available in the calendar. You can set the starting date and time of the event and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alarm setting is also a great part of the Pixon interface. You can set up to 10 alarms, each with the following configurable options - snooze duration and repeat, repetition days and name. You can of course choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level. This feature can be quite handy if you have the habit of switching off your handset at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the other organizer offerings are a voice recorder, world time application and a unit converter. There are also to-do and memo applications for taking down tasks and notes. A countdown timer and a stopwatch will probably seem appealing to sport-minded users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator of Samsung M8800 Pixon is pretty nice. You have all the numbers and the most common operations on the screen. You can access some more advanced functions on another screen by pressing the fx button in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Samsung M8800 Pixon comes with an office documents viewer that supports Word, Excel, Powerpoint and PDF files. It's an application produced by Access and is one of the nicest additions to the Pixon software package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The documents viewer is quick enough when opening files, however zooming is somewhat clumsy. The document viewer also works in landscape mode (with automatic screen rotation), which makes reading easier with less panning.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games? sort of<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical recent Samsung, the M8800 Pixon only offers a bunch of trial games. Entertaining though they might be, they can only keep you busy for a short while. Full versions are available for a small fee. Since Samsung didn't bother putting really playable games in the handset, we don't see the need to get into any detail about the demos offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing in the games section that isn't a trial is the Tumbling dice app, which uses the built-in accelerometer. Shaking the phone for an occasional roll of the dice may be a fun way of trying your luck, it also looks cool and it's free.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We really loved the Samsung F480 and we were more than happy to welcome its successor. Now, if you look at it that way, upgrading the Tocco is a serious task but the Pixon seems well up to it. It's true though that quad-band GSM support and accelerometer are the only non-imaging related upgrades. The rest - 8MP camera, high-res video recording, DivX/XviD playback, and TV out - leave no doubt that the Pixon is all about multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that brings us back to how Samsung handle their cameraphone strategy. Efforts at this point are shared between an 8MP all-in-one and an 8MP touchscreen. Being humbled by the INNOV8 may seem just right for the Pixon but it's interesting to see how it handles pressure from the true - and loaded - competitors like LG Renoir and SE C905.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Pixon may be a couple of high-tech goodies short but what's there makes perfect sense. The nice and sharp TouchWiz UI, cool web and music, and high-end imaging sure sell.</paragraph>
