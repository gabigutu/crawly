			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor is made in China and proudly so. Designed, engineered and created in the Land of the Dragon, it's nothing like your run-of-the-mill cheap knock-off. It's a genuine Chinese product, not just something put together for someone else ? including premium brands drawn by the low manufacturing costs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor is a Chinese smartphone ? and one with solid specs too. Not as loaded as the Meizu MX, but a lot more subtle too in doing an impression of some of its illustrious contemporaries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Huawei U8860 Honor official shot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, most phones in the Huawei lineup looks like a phone you've seen. This is not a trivia quiz though. And we don?t care what phone (or phones) the Huawei Honor brings to mind. There must be more important things to Huawei than coming up with fresh original designs. How much bigger, you ask? Well, how about - pretty huge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A multibillion multinational, Huawei is - to put it simply - the Chinese version of Motorola or Ericsson. One of the world?s leading network and telecom equipment manufacturers, they've been making mobile phones too for a while now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ideos should ring a bell: a small lineup of low-to-mid-tier Android smartphones and tablets. The Honor is the next step for them. It?s pretty much the company?s current flagship. A 1.4GHz-powered Gingerbread-running smartphone with a rather interesting custom skin. The 4? FWVGA screen and the 8 megapixel camera are the other prominent features on the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Droids come in all shapes and sizes, feature sets and price tags. You?ve heard it all about Samsung?s droids, or Sony Ericsson?s, or HTC?s. And think that?s all there?s to know about Android. Well, apparently Huawei can show a few tricks too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not quite sure about the first impression the Huawei U8860 Honor leaves. You'd do well though not to let it fool you. Plain design and more cheap gloss than we're comfortable with - most people will find it hard to believe they're dealing with a rather impressively spec'd handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an easy one to miss but anyone looking for a reasonably priced Android cameraphone should pay attention. It?s time to see if the Honor can do the job and make at least some difference in a crowd filled with class ?A? contenders. The Huawei Honor isn?t trying to impress or scare the Galaxy Nexus or the iPhone 4S. It?s a fight they will win even with one hand tied behind their back. It?s users Huawei need to convince and if the Honor turns out credible, they?d be one step closer to their goal.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei U8860 Honor 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor is not the lightest device around at 140 g but it does remain quite manageable at 122 x 61 x 11 mm for a smartphone with a 4? screen. The weight of the handset actually adds a bit of substance ? which is welcome considering the phone?s design desperately lacks character.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei U8860 Honor is a reasonably sized 4-incher and the screen bezel is fairly thin ? there isn?t much unused space. The metal frame surrounding the screen fails to add even the slightest bit of style. Even if it does, it gets drowned in the cheap gloss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, it?s a very clean design, which may as well look better in some of the other paint jobs available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main focus on the front is the 4" capacitive LCD of FWVGA (480 x 854) resolution. Technically, there?re enough pixels but the picture is somewhat dim. The overall poor Image quality and viewing angles make the display the weakest point of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are all the numbers - you can compare it against some of the best in the class that we've tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display you'll find four capacitive buttons for Home, Menu, Back and Search. They light up when touched but otherwise stay out of the way for the most part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display there's the usual earpiece, along with a secondary VGA camera and a proximity sensor to disable the display during calls. A tiny status LED is in the top right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Honor U8860 features the volume rocker, while the right side of the phone is free of any controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone holds the MicroUSB port for data connections and charging. On either side of the port you get the mouthpiece and a tiny slit for lifting the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power/lock button of the Huawei Honor is placed at the top and next to it is a 3.5 mm headphone jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we particularly disliked about the Honor is the back panel. It's black and glossy and very easily gets smudges all over, which are in turn almost impossible to get rid of. You'll find the 8 MP camera lens on the back, with a single LED flash and a loudspeaker grill on either side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei logo is stamped below them in white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the glossy back panel reveals the insides of the Huawei U8860 Honor and the big 1900 mAh Li-Po battery. Our unit had a battery with 1880-1930mAh range. Hidden under the battery are the SIM card and microSD card compartments, which can only be accessed with the battery removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei are keen to make a point about the Honor's powerful battery. There?s still a dedicated Power saving mode in the settings. It will disable Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, switch off UI animations and haptics, and set the screen brightness to the lowest possible value. Display timeout is set to 15 seconds while background connections and mobile data are turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We generally don?t mind the plain design but the gloss is just too much for our taste. That said, some of the alternative color versions may fare better. We?ve no complaints about the general ergonomics and build. We just wonder whether the plastic just feels cheap or actually is. To be honest, there seem to be no major weak spots to warn against except perhaps the low display image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is easily pocketable and simple to operate single-handedly, which is a plus considering you get a 4? screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Heavily customized Android Gingerbread<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei U8860 Honor is, by OS, yet another smartphone wearing droidish green. The platform version is 2.3.5 Gingerbread and Huawei have gone a long way in customizing it. The custom Huawei launcher offers an entirely different layout, options, appearance and much more. It reminds us a little of Launcher Pro for Android, especially in the transitions department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a user interface demo video to kick-off the software part of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei launcher gives you a set of options - theme, app icons, you can download additional themes, set the animation of the screen transitions, the number of screens, which is the default one and choose between a scrollable and a static wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main homescreen is almost the same as on the vanilla Android - you get the notification area at the top, which you swipe down to reveal. It offers quick toggles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Synchronization and Screen rotation. Running services such as USB, MyPhoneExplorer and other are displayed below the quick toggles and so are the various notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the homescreen you'll find three app icons that you can change to whichever app you want. On the left and right of them, Huawei have placed two smaller icons - the left one is the app drawer and on the right a thumb-style leap view for quick jumping or closing of apps. You can alternatively open it by holding the back capacitive button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To open the full-fledged task manager one needs to hold the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing an item on the homescreen is done by either the menu button or by holding a finger on an empty spot on the screen. The next context menu should come as no surprise to Android veterans - you get to add shortcuts, widgets, folders and enter the launcher settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu reminds us of the one found in the Galaxy S under Eclair and Froyo. You can rearrange icons as you wish. An interesting option is that you can create folders inside the main menu, which is very convenient. The folder interface has an uncanny resemblance to iOS, only a bit ugly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei have also conveniently added a file manager on the Honor. Sure there are popular ones out there on the Android Market for free but it's nice to be given a propriety option preinstalled. It displays the on-board and extended storages and also the installed apps. You can open apps, add them to different directories and uninstall them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Single-core performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to performance, the Huawei U8860 Honor is more than adequate. It does the job done and you won't get any hiccups whatsoever. It?s powered by a 1.4 GHz MSM8255T Snapdragon processor and 512 MB RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its Achilles heel is the single-core-only processor. This year we're in for quad-core tablets and phones and single-core just doesn't cut it for a flagship. Not all people out there are looking for multi-core processors in their phones. Those come at a price too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But for comparison's sake we test the Honor on Quadrant, AnTuTu and Smartbench 11. Here are the results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Paper specs and scores aside the U8860 can still play 720p video both from its storage and from YouTube it has Flash preinstalled. Our unit has distinct problems when it came to the browser. It just kept crashing, sadly it?s expected that a pre-release unit would present such flaws.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has social streams<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The one feature that stands out in the phonebook of the Huawei Honor is its Streams feature. You can preset your Facebook and Twitter accounts to display content from your Facebook buddies and subscribed people and the ones on Twitter you're following. There's also a screen widget to go along with the added functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from this novelty, the Android phonebook preinstalled on the Honor U8860 is pretty standard-issue, meaning it?s perfectly fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony doing well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making phone calls with the Honor isn't a problem but we did dislike the fact that you can't make video calls, despite the secondary video-call camera. We hope this feature lands in future updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We performed our traditional loudspeaker test on the Huawei U8860 Honor and it got a Good score. Especially when playing high-pitch tones or vocals it won't be trouble in louder environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is also present on the Honor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei music on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music app on the Honor U8860 is really nice to work with. You get the usual array of tabs you'll find in most music player out there - albums, songs, playlists but you also get to choose folders, artists, composers and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is available and where you're songs don't have one the player displays compact disks with different colors. While you're playing a track the player presents a very nice swooshy scrollable cover flow-typed animation. Swiping between song covers changes the currently playing song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want you can also add lyrics to your songs and have them displayed while you're listening to a track. The now playing screen is also present in the notification area but not in the lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera on board the Huawei Honor is an 8 MP unit capable of 3264x2448 resolution photos. It has autofocus, a single LED flash, geo-tagging and HDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is stock Gingerbread which we particularly dislike. Almost every big Android-using household name out there has made their own interface that's superior to the stock one. It's just that the imaginary bezel around the actual viewfinder is pretty huge and takes a lot of room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The offered settings are okay but not really that abundant. You get exposure, HDR, Flash settings and more but ISO, white balance, etc. are not included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of actual camera performance and picture quality we're pleased with the Honor. It produces good images with plenty of detail, nice color reproduction and a relatively low amount of noise. However competing devices like the Galaxy S II and iPhone 4S offer more detail with more fine-tuned white balance, colors and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another dent in the stills armor is the aggressive noise reduction algorithm which smears a lot of fine detail to compensate for noise. This isn't the approach most people prefer as photos tend to look grainy and color painted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor isn't the best cameraphone out there by a longshot but it's also above average for the Android class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the samples from the Huawei Honor U8860.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also did a macro test and got great results. Here they are.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor's camera enters our Photo quality comparison tool to spar with the likes of the Meizu MX and the iPhone 4S. As you can see it's no match for Apple's prime toy but is able to edge out the Meizu in all three charts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tool's page will give you all the information on what to look out for.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor captures 720p video at 30 fps, which is still a great achievement. Even in the face of FullHD-capable smartphones many would still prefer the less storage-towing HD format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder UI is the same as the camera one - stock Gingerbread. And we dislike that one too, for instance video quality isn't simply 720p, VGA, QVGA but Large, Medium and Small. The software bezel around the viewfinder is also very annoyingly huge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor produces smooth videos but we cannot help wishing for more detail. Just like with the stills fine detail gets smeared probably due to some strong noise reduction algorithm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 720p video sample for your viewing pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download this untouched sample 720p@30fps, taken straight off the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a 720p capable device the Huawei Honor enters our video comparison tool. It produces smooth videos but we're disappointed by the amount of captured detail and the lack of real resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the tool page's information if you have any questions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Cloud + Drive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Cloud + Drive gives users 16 gigs of online storage for their files. All that's required is an account registration, which takes about a minute and you're good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app gives you the option to check your disk, manage transmissions (upload and download), view recently browsed files and share files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Huawei Honor is a pre-release unit so we kept getting "Server busy" errors and couldn't enjoy the full functionality of the service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up when you want your device to be synced, allow the Cloud to find your phone should you lose it by any chance and more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and organizing skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor comes with a lot of propriety apps preinstalled. The usual array of organizing apps are there too so your alarm clock, calendar, calculator, etc. are all covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The traffic manager is a pretty neat app that lets you set a monthly limit of MBs so that you won't go overboard with your mobile data usage. It also displays detailed information about Wi-Fi traffic, 2G/3G, remaining traffic and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Security guard is the blacklist app of sorts for the Huawei Honor U8860. Sure, there are a lot of those around the Android Market but it's nice to have one preinstalled for you. It also gives the option to hide messaging conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Documents To Go is an office suite app preinstalled on the Honor. It allows viewing of Office files for free but does require a paid upgrade if you want to be able to edit docs on the go. There's also a DLNA app that lets you share multimedia content via the phone's Wi-Fi connection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Honor is a capable device but it would definitely have a hard time dealing with its ?Made in China? stigma.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei is a major telecommunications player and has enough leverage to cut deals with telecoms and we?re sure it will get over the not so noble origin and turn the situation in its own favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brand may not be that popular as a phone manufacturer, but Huawei are stepping up the effort in improving brand recognition as we speak, forgoing past attempts of setting up the Ideos brand as its headliner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei is yet to establish itself as a major player on the market for smartphones and that holds true Stateside too. There, the Chinese giant supplies mostly low-end, low-cost devices for unsubsidized carriers. Some of them are even sold under different names ? not Huawei. The company is now looking to increase its brand awareness by offering higher-end devices such as the Impulse 4G for AT&amp;T. The Honor has been launched contract-free on Cricket Wireless under the name of Huawei Mercury.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honor is a solid try in that direction ? a good midrange option with some high-end specs. It?s very different from the Meizu MX in being a lot more subtle when borrowing ideas from other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also liked the creativity in the custom interface ? it almost makes up for the tepid styling. Nevertheless we would have preferred a better camera performance and perhaps, a better quality screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a glance at the Honor's competition you realize that Huawei have secured a comfortable spot for their device among the waves of competition. It does offer a decent package of capabilities but more importantly offers a below-$300 price range SIM-free, which is a huge plus for people with tight budgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Arc and Arc S will set you back between $50 and $100 more but offer a better camera performance, slimmer design and superior displays than the Honor. What you would be sacrificing is the extended battery life of the Honor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc ? Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has a lot of devices to offer in this price range but the one that most meets the Honor on the specs front is the Galaxy W. It matches the processing power of the Huawei device and is preloaded with Samsung's TouchWiz UI, which is among the better recognizable and easy to use custom UIs out there. It does fall short of the imaging and display real estate properties of the Honor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy W I8150</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if Android isn't your first choice, Windows Phone offers a refreshingly different user experience. The HTC Radar is a compelling buy for the same sub-$300 price, it offers the latest WP7 incarnation - Mango, which means it's really smooth. It also has a superior build quality than the Honor. However, a 1 GHz only processor and 5 MP camera (which is not that good anyway) set it apart from the Huawei here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Radar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are alright with the few hardware shortcomings the Honor presents and you get a good deal on it, perhaps the Huawei U8860 Honor is an easy pick. It?s actually a very balanced device . The company has nicely covered the UX basics by adding extra value to Android by the means of Cloud+, Huawei Music, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are yet to see how persistent the company is in supporting its products after sales by delivering timely software updates and bug fixes but the outlook is good. Huawei already teased us with a solid promise for Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
