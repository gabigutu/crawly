			<paragraph>6.9 mm - this is how thin the slimmest mobile phone in the world is. At the same time Samsung X820 offers rich features, a comfortable keypad, and a brilliant display. Even so, it remains just a bit from real perfection.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>    Samsung X820 in official photos </paragraph>
			<paragraph>We live in a world defined by categories as the biggest, the most beautiful, the smartest... and everyone is trying to outperform the others... Well, it seems that the Korean manufacturer Samsung has managed to do so in the mobile world by creating the slimmest mobile phone ever - Samsung X820. The profile of this device will amaze you, believe me.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The competition among handset manufacturers about who would launch the slimmest mobile phone was first run - unintentionally probably - by Motorola and its first Razr model (13.9 mm thick), which provoked great astonishment among users. And a new trend was born. Razr was followed by the slimmer SLVR L7 model (12 mm thick). The new Samsung X820, however, is so slim, that the entire competition has been moved to a completely different - far higher, or should I say "slimmer" - level. Its 6.9 mm deserve a special attention and that's what it's going to get in this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung announced the launch of an entire line of ultra-slim phones. Along with the slimmest, classic-shaped X820 model the Korean manufacturer is going to launch Samsung D830, which will be the slimmest clamshell ever. The third for the series is the slider Samsung D900 (12.9 mm thick), which recently hit the market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Black is cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It seems that Samsung designers have become sick of silver... It was not long ago when we wrote about how identical Samsung clamshells were due to the silver nuance their creators would continuously use on them, while praising at the same time the chic black elements on the E300 model. Now silver is gone... and black rules. Not a bad decision, btw.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only non-black elements on Samsung X820 are the silver band on the top, the manufacturer's logo, and the white legends of the keys. Samsung X820 could hardly be described as extravagant, exceptional, or very attractive. Due to its 113 x 50 mm and its slightly rounded contours, its front looks pretty common.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real magic comes at the moment when you grab Samsung X820 and feel it in your palm. On one hand, its 7 mm astonish; on the other, however, they raise fears as to how solid such a thin body could be. As we were provided with one copy of the phone only, we did not dare to test Samsung X820's constructional limits. Nevertheless, I can assure you that the phone has an excellent construction. It is solid and all elements fit in perfectly. Neither the phone in general, nor the subtle battery cover gave out a single creak during the tests. At the same time it is necessary to say that the Samsung X820's body carries no steel reinforcements. All parts are elaborated of plastics, a fact proven by the weight of the phone - 66 grams. If we were to test how solid the phone is, we would have probable had to sit on it pretending to have forgotten it in someone's back-pocket. I bet it would have endured.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No eyelet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the right side of Samsung X820 you will find the camera shortcut button as well as a connector for both the earphones and the charger. The latter is protected by a rubber cap fastened to the phone body and thus hard to lose. The dual volume-control button is situated on the left. The top area of the rear side of the phone is somewhat thicker as it is here where the camera lens is integrated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the bottom, beneath the plastic cover, you will see a Li-Po battery with a capacity of 800 mAh (it might come with 630 mAh battery in other markets). If you spare Samsung X820 extensive use, it will repay you with almost 3-day battery cycle. If you mean to make use of all its functions, it will probably ask you for a dose of energy every second day or so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To my opinion, the Korean manufacturer has forgotten to implant one pretty important element in Samsung X820, that is, an eyelet for hanging the phone around one's neck. In any case, Samsung X820 is a stylish, even if not so extravagant handset, which deserves to be publicly demonstrated.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Landscape display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A major part of all mobile phones feature vertically orientated displays. Samsung, however, has decided not to compile with this common trend and has equipped its X820 model with a horizontal display. The first Samsung mobile to feature a horizontal display was the smart phone i320. The next one, after X820, is the P300. I myself appreciate this decision as landscape displays resemble TV displays, computer screens, and multimedia players. So why should they not appear in mobile phones as well? What's more, the landscape display makes reading messages and browsing WAP pages far easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung X820 display has a resolution of 220 x 176 pixels and a 262K color definition. Like most Samsung displays the one of X820 is classy and deserves a special compliment: colors are deep; contrast and brightness are tuned brilliantly. My only remark here refers to visibility under direct sunlight, which in the case of Samsung X820 is rather poor due to the glossy cover layer. In order to read the displayed content, turn the handset so that it reflects a solid surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display goes out a few moments after you lock the keypad,. In such case both time and state details remain invisible. To illuminate the display (even if keypad is locked) simply press a random key on the keypad.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Brilliant keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As Samsung X820 is the slimmest, but not the narrowest or the shortest, its keypad has been mounted on plenty of space on the front cover. Numeric keys are pretty big, but extremely flat in order to keep phone's profile as slim as possible. Nevertheless, typing is more than comfortable thanks to the relative bulging of the keys, press feedback is 100% precise, and response is prompt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mark I give to the main button in the middle of the controller is not so high though. The "i" key alone is due some criticism since a WAP browser that can be run directly from the stand-by mode is only a appropriate decision only if you are on a flat data plan. To avoid paying for data transfers caused by incidental use of the key I recommend you to set up two profiles - a full one and a non-functional one. This way you will be able to select the right one, whenever it is necessary, while pressing the key by accident won't harm your budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The central key is more or less the only true drawback in Samsung X820's otherwise superb control navigation. Press orientation could have been more precise if this key had been made slightly higher than surrounding keys, for example. In the dark, the keypad is illuminated in white-greenish light, which can be de/activated from the menu. If you prefer to save energy, you may want to set backlights to light up in pre-determined intervals, from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start typing on Samsung X820's keypad, you will probably come to agree with me that slimness is here to attract attention rather than facilitate phone use. When keys in the right column are to be pressed, one has to either unnaturally curve their thumb, or simply lean the handset against their fingers, which, however, leads to quite an unstable handhold. If you do not trust me, grab any common mobile phone placed nearby and you will immediately feel the difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Menu in black<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of Samsung X820's main menu is entirely new. Former sprightly colored icons have been replaced by a less-colorful, but far more elegant menu. The left area of the display is occupied by a 9-icon matrix, while selected icon shows on the right in a bigger format accompanied by a description above. Each of the nine icons features a special color. The same goes for the legend bands. Submenus are viewed as a list only. When an item is selected, its background becomes orange, while its font goes bigger and starts to roll. I myself do not find orange a very pleasant choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black in display's background suits Samsung X820 perfectly, while the white menu version is ideal for shiny summer days as it makes reading easier. The menu navigation allows the use of number shortcuts. All four ways of the control button are user-configurable in stand-by mode too. In addition, numeric keys can be assigned shortcuts for immediate connection with selected contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, Samsung X820's menu navigation is pretty user-friendly. Soft-keys do not change their functions almost at all: the left one opens the main menu or confirms user's choice, while the right one sends you back to an upper level. The red key takes you back to stand-by display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Calls &amp; phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The memory Samsung X820 carries is sufficient to save a total of 1000 contacts. What's more, it has no problem to fit in all 12 fields available inside each contact. The phone views SIM and phone directories simultaneously. The phonebook is searched by gradual typing of the contact's name. A highly appreciated feature in all smartphones is their ability to search contacts both by first and last name. Let's hope that common handsets will all soon be equipped with this option as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be organized in groups, which can be assigned a special melody or image. Yet, groups serve as folders and only help mass message sending. Nothing more, nothing less. Samsung X820 does not offer any ringing profiles, which means that call filtering is not available either. The phone alerts you for incoming calls by using a polyphonic melody or MP3 files. Samsung X820 cannot vibrate and ring simultaneously, which - to my modest opinion - is quite a drawback. Anyway, when the phone vibrates, vibrations are apparently created by the built-in speaker as even a tiny vibrating motor would never fit into such a thin body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main speaker is loud enough. At it highest volume level, it sounds as a kind of a quiet loudspeaker. All sound bands are present and clearly recognizable. A pretty interesting thing is the so called extra tones. Samsung X820 uses one type of sound to confirm that connection to an opposite call party has been established (ringing), and another type to alert you that the connection has been terminated. Wireless connection is also available thanks to the presence of Bluetooth support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Work with messages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS editor offers a total of 5 text lines at a time. To my surprise, it counts written characters down from the crazy number 1836, so one needs to make certain efforts in order to count up the characters still available to use. At least it alerts when a sub-message has been finished and another one has been started. In all lower segment Samsung models the T9 dictionary needs to be deactivated every time a message has been started. In Samsung X820, fortunately, this is necessary no more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor offers several interesting features: it allows for saving more than 1 page, each of which can contain text, an image or a video, and a melody. In addition, directly from the menu, you may also insert a business card, a timetable, an anniversary, a note, a planed item, and a so called "another file", which is a file, which the phone cannot make use of (game etc,) and which otherwise won't be possible to be sent away in a MMS (a java game, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is very good. It gives the possibility to create up to five POP3/IMAP accounts, provides automatic mail checking in pre-defined intervals, and attaches files seamlessly. It even offers a simple anti-spam filter! In other words, it is fully sufficient for replying to urgent mails.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games and images<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung X820 works with MP3 music files. Yet I fear passionate music fans will remain unsatisfied with the capabilities of this new Korean dandy for several reasons. First, the phone offers no memory card slot. The built-in memory offers a reasonable capacity of 82 MB, which is however far too less for storing music. Besides, music fans are rarely fond of non-standard connectors, which obligate them to use only the earphones enclosed in the original phone package, which is exactly the case of Samsung X820. I do not have to write that this type of earphones almost never offer good music experience. And in the end, Samsung X820 does not have a radio application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the phone lacks in terms of music, it makes up for in imaging. Samsung X820 is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera, which takes photos of surprisingly high quality. Of course, we could hardly expect it to compete with the best on the market, but its results are definitely above the medium level. Pictures feature a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. Colors are sharp; white is balanced successfully, even if there is a slight case of overexposure. In the camera menu you will find plenty of functions. One of the most interesting is the option of ISO value setup, which helps creating pretty sharp images under artificial light conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample photos in full resolution: </paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;   &nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung X820 is also able to shoot videos with sound in a resolution of 352 x 288 pixels. While shooting you can use zoom, modify brightness levels, apply various effects. Videos are saved in MP4 format. The available memory allures to save longer videos or even entire series, but in such case, make sure you convert the respective material into 3gp format. Data and files can be easily transferred from a PC into the phone and vice versa using Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Macro mode would have come in handy; even so shooting text has a nice result</paragraph>
			<paragraph> No zoom applied ? full zoom</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Calendar is simple<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar is available in a monthly, a weekly and daily view. Inside this application you can store 4 types of information: name, note, place, and starting and end date and time. This way you can create an entire school timetable. The problem is that the phone repeats subjects every day and nothing can be done about it. Further on in the calendar you will also find an anniversary option that repeats every year, a simple note, and a planned task, which replaces the missing task organizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is able to save up to 100 notes of the same type, which is more than enough. Pitifully, designers have not reserved a bit of the standby screen for instant view of the events inside the respective selected day.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Internet &amp; extras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung X820 supports data transfers in GPRS and EDGE Class 10. Of course, the phone can also serve as a modem for connecting to other devices through a cable or via the wireless Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No current mobile phone can do without Java these days. Samsung X820 is no exception of the rule. The phone offers two pre-installed games: the first one is a close relative of the famous Sokoban, where you have to use the rabbit to gather (in the right order) all carrots located in a labyrinth. In the second game you shoot penalties into a football gate. Additional games can be downloaded through WAP or via Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further on the phone features a voice recorder which offers a recording duration limit option, which allows for inserting an audio record into a MMS or email. The maximum duration a voice record could reach is one hour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung X820's music player is nothing special in terms of graphics, but it can play music in the background, which is good news. Other functions worth mentioning are the calculator, the world time, the physical unit converter, the timer, and the stopwatch with mid-time measurer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock of Samsung X820 offers three separate alarms, two of which can be set to repeat once or daily. The third one can be set as an alarm on working days only. The phone is equipped with an image editor, which is also worth our attention as it allows additional application of 9 effects, rotate pictures in all directions, and resize images so they can be attached to a MMS. Cropping is also available. Modified pictures can finally be saved under a new, different file name, while the name of the original image remains unchanged.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Just for the record<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that extreme slimness will become the greatest advantage of the new Samsung X820. Let's also remind its brilliant display, its comfortable keypad, its significant memory capacity etc. Nevertheless, it is also necessary to point out that the price/features ratio leaves Samsung X820 somewhat behind the competitors with similar software load. The slimmest in the world lacks a memory card slot, for example. In other words, this new Korean dandy will hardly interest you if you insist on having a feature-packed mobile phone. Samsung X820 bets on sentiment instead on reason.</paragraph>
