		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia army of touchscreen smartphones gets larger by the hour and the Nokia N97 mini is surely one of the most interesting new recruits. The Finnish company has obviously reconsidered its priories and now focuses on optimization, rather than expansion with its flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original Nokia N97 was the first sign of that as it hardly offered any ground-breaking features, instead relaying on the good all-round performance. However the first high-end S60 touchscreen handset left enough room for another similar handset in the portfolio and Nokia feel that its downsized version is enough to fill the gap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N97 mini vs Nokia N97<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The N97 mini has quite a task on its hands, constantly being compared to the moe high ranking Nokia N97 even though it comes later to the market. As usually happens in such cases, the price difference that would have been present if both handsets were launched simultaneously is reduced and the balance of powers has shifted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the reduced display (and mostly body size) is a welcome change for many users, who used to find the Nokia N97 intolerably bulky. We certainly hope it's got a few tricks up its sleeves so it can put up the original N97 a good fight and differentiate enough beyond size and pricing. Well, we're about to check that and much more in one of our trademark reviews, starting with the unboxing on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package is nothing to rave about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There isn't too many differences between the retail packages of Nokia N97 mini and the original N97. There are a few omissions in order to keep the price lower but hardly anything a regular user would notice. Basically the content inside is covering all the essentials, without providing too many surprises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the charger plus a data cable and a nicely designed handsfree that we see for the first time. It looks pretty cool but unofortunately is one-piece only so replacing the headphones while keeping the remote is not an option. At least there are several different ear-buds so you can find the one that best fits your ears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't a stylus included in the Nokia N97 mini retail package but we hardly miss that too much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N97 mini 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N97 mini measures 113 x 52.5 x 14.2 mm, totaling a volume of 75cc. Those numbers don't sound too impressive in isolation but compared to the 117.2 x 55.3 x 15.9 mm of the original N97 they certainly are great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course some trade-of were inevitable - like cutting down on display estate or losing the D-pad on the QWERTY keyboard, but all the main functionality is still there and you get a much more compact package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the smartphone QWERTY side-slider class the Nokia N97 mini easily ranks among the compact handsets. The non-touch E75 is the only handset that is noticeably more compact but it has quite a lot of other features discarded to reduce size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 138g is another improvement over the original N97, which weigh the hefty 150g. The mini version still maintains its solid feel but weights less in your pocket. Yet the 12 gram difference will hardly be decisive for anyone. Obviously Nokia thought the same way - otherwise they would have used plastic for the battery cover again and reduced the weight even further.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Slid-close and in isolation you will hardly recognize that the N97 is a different model at all. There wasn't too much time for redesigning and the Nokia engineers preferred to spend it on the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were happy enough with the original N97 design and our only regret was that its all-plastic construction was unfit for its high-end status and pricetag. Obviously Nokia paid attention and this time the battery cover material is metallic. The camera lens cover has also been removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are also really pleased with the quality of the plastic used for the rest of the N97 mini body. It's the same as the one used for N86 8MP and the original N97. It is a real fingerprint-repeller, while at the same time looks sturdy enough to survive without many marks and scratches (under regular usage, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N97 mini front is mostly about the 16M-color resistive touchscreen. It has the same resolution as its bigger brother (360 x 640 pixels) but as we mentioned, its diagonal has shrunk from 3.5" to 3.2". That nHD resolution seems pretty sufficient to use for virtually any use but some users might still find it disadvantageous compared to the WVGA that some of the competitors have to offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Nokia N97 mini display is about the same as on the original N97. The smaller size makes it less impressive, of course, but the contrast and brightness levels are equal. Mind you, we won't be mad if Nokia chose the Samsung way and went to AMOLED screens for more of its flagships. Having that extra bit of contrast is a nice thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N97 mini uses a resistive touchscreen, just like every other S60 touch-enabled Nokia so far. This means a bit of pressure on the screen is needed for a tap to be registered but allows the use of stylus and gloves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the Nokia N97 mini is on par with the competition, and save for the Samsung Jet and Pixon12, we haven't seen a resistive-touchscreen handset perform much better. Nokia seem to have done some tweaking to the screen so that now its responsiveness with fingers is better than the original N97. There is also haptic feedback with adjustable intensity, which we find really comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is equal on the two Nokia N97s - they are both excellent. We are glad that it has nothing to do with the mediocre sunlight legibility of Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and 5530 XpressMusic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch-sensitive call and end keys plus a regular hardware menu key sit right below the screen. Their layout in the Nokia N97 mini is an exact copy of what we saw in the original Nokia N97.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece and video-call camera are at the top of the Nokia N97 mini front, along with an ambient light and a proximity sensor. The proximity sensor makes sure that the display is switched off when you hold it next to your ear.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The functional elements on the sides of the Nokia N97 mini have an identical layout to that of its bigger brother. That means that the camera key and the dual volume button are on the right. The camera key is fine but the volume rocker feedback has quite some room for improvement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features the microUSB port and the screen lock slider. The stereo speakers are also here at the two edges. There is no protective cover for the USB slot so dust and dirt accumulation is pretty likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power key is at the top of Nokia N97 mini, right next to the 3.5mm audio jack. You can also use the power key for alternating the profiles as customary for the phones with this operating system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of Nokia N97 mini is pretty plain with the lanyard eyelet being the only diversion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you slide the Nokia N97 mini open, the three-row QWERTY keyboard pops up in front of your face. The keys are a bit smaller than on the original N97 but they are still large enough and will enough spacing to be comfortable even for larger-handed users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feedback levels are also great, increasing the typing speed even further. We aren't too thrilled about having only three rows on a QWERTY keyboard, but they got the rest of it right. The problem is that keys get a bit crowded with a three-row layout (having two chars each) and intensive usage of a modifier (the symbol key) is required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad of the original N97 is removed in the N97 mini, replaced by four arrow keys. Placed on the right of the keyboard those are really comfortable, with the nearby enter key compensating for the lack of a confirming center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This arrangement has allowed the Space key to be shifted a bit to the middle, where it is much easier to reach. Considering that this is one of the most frequently used keys when typing we count this as a major usability boost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N97 mini 5 megapixel camera is on the backside of the handset, right next to dual LED flash. Those aren't protected by anything this time so getting them scratched even under regular usage is pretty likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover lays another downgrade of Nokia N97 mini compared to the original N97. The BP-4D has 25% smaller capacity (1200 mAh) than the N97 battery. Understandably, its performance isn't quite as impressive too. The N97 mini should last for up to 320 hours of stand-by and 7 hours and ten minutes of talk-time in a 2G network or 310 hours of stand-by and 6 hours of talk time on UMTS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality we had to charge our Nokia N97 mini every 36 hours but ours was nothing else than extensive torture. What regular users should expect is charging their handset every third day or something like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is also located under the battery cover with Nokia N97 mini. That means that whenever you need to change memory cards you will need to remove it, which causes some inconvenience. On the positive side the N97 mini can handle 16GB microSD cards which are the largest currently available on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Nokia N97 mini is really satisfactory. With the addition of some metallic elements it is now even nicer to touch than the original N97. Unfortunately, the sliding mechanism issue of having uneven tension hasn't been solved. The spring is a bit too rigid at first followed by an all too sudden release that makes a loud banging noise. We have seen Nokia do a lot better than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least this time the full specs quote visible on the back of the phone when it's slid open are gone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Widgetized S60 UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We stand by every word we said about the S60 5th and its approach to touchscreen. Long story short, the direct translation of D-pad and soft-key action into touch has its benefits but the result is hardly the most fluent and intuitive touchscreen interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling has been changed, thanks to a firmware update, and it's a great improvement over the previous scheme. Now you have kinetic scrolling (or flick scrolling as Nokia call it) and it's really smooth with nice elasticity at both ends of the scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>List menus still require a double click to activate, though, while icons do great with a single one. Really - go figure!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you know your way around S60, you'll be quite at home with the N97 mini interface and you'll swear by it. But if you look at it more objectively maybe, just maybe, you will realize some things come out a tad better on other touchscreen handsets than they do on S60 5th.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N97 mini, being the slightly shorter sibling of the N97, uses a widget-enabled homescreen, just like its taller bro. This is the only significant change since the 5800 XpressMusic and for now is the trademark of the N97 pair - other S60 5th edition phones don't have them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are the fad these days and their usability is unquestioned. They can't be the dramatic improvement you've been waiting for though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is also worth mentioning that, compared to the 5800 XpressMusic, Nokia N97 mini has a tad snappier UI (thanks to the faster ARM 11 434 MHz processor perhaps). There weren't any major lags or holdups for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the widgets are something new for the S60 5th edition, the menu structure is a d?j? vu - the same as in Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and not that different from 3rd edition. Icons are organized in a 3 x 4 grid or a list and you can freely reorder. Screen orientation can be set to change automatically. Sliding out the QWERTY keyboard makes the screen rotate as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening an item in any of the list submenus calls for two presses - one to select, and another one to confirm the action. Now that's something that you don't normally see often in touch phones. You get used to it with time, but the main issue here is that the interface logic is different when you deal with icons instead of lists - there just a single click does the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A scroll bar is also available in both list and icon menus.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Here comes the homescreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The homescreen layout of the N97 mini (not counting the widgets) is similar to the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic version - all the status indicators are at the top, plus the clock and the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A single press on the clock starts the clock application (with an option for setting up an alarm) while tapping on the date opens a drop-down menu where you can either enter the calendar application or change the currently active profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's take a closer look at the widgets. If they are hidden, just sweep a finger across the screen and they'll show up. Another sweep will make them disappear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have up to 5 widgets at a time displayed on the homescreen (you can't change the clock) and you can arrange them according to which you use most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of widgets to choose from - there are tools like the WLAN wizard, music player controls, a calendar or a widget with four favorite contacts (you can have two of those). The other widgets are linked to various sites and services - Amazon, Facebook, AccuWeather, Associated Press, CNN, Elle and quite a few more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ovi Store comes in when you get bored of the preinstalled widgets, but will cover that in more length later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Arranging widgets is easy and fun. You can remove some of them, add others, change their order (just drag and drop). If all 5 slots have been taken, you have to remove one or more widgets to make room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N97 mini comes with 4 preloaded themes and most of them are really appealing. You can also download third party themes from the internet. As before, you can switch the themes effects on and off. Unfortunately, even if the transitions look kinda cool, they cause occasional lags when browsing the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N97 mini features a task manager, which is launched by a press-and-hold on the menu key. The task manager itself is identical to the one found on Symbian S60 3.2 devices. Also much like in the previous version of the UI, it appears on top of every pop-up menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebooks remains unchanged<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N97 mini uses a phonebook that's identical to what previous versions of the UI have offered. Except for the whole touch thingy, that is. The phonebook itself has virtually unlimited capacity and functionality is among the best we've seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one. Personal ringtones and videos are also available for assigning. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors - accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers (even WLAN connections are included).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No smart-dial takes all the fun out of the telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any problems with the in-call performance of Nokia N97. Reception levels are good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is an option with the N97 as with mostly any other phone. The voice dialing mode is activated once you press and hold the Call key. It is fully speaker-independent and doesn't require prerecording the names of your contacts. Bear in mind though, that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a contact, the first or the default one gets dialed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can silence an incoming call on the phone by simply flipping it over. Those feature was also available in 5800 XpressMusic and through third party application on the previous versions on the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making a call is very good. Thanks to the proximity sensor the screen turns off automatically while close to your head. There are four big buttons available - mute, hold, loudspeaker and end call. Form the options menu you can find more settings like lock screen and keys, switch to video call, new call and etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problems that the original N97 had with answering and rejecting calls with the receiver keys are gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on Nokia N97 mini. The handset scored a Very Good mark in our test. You might want to keep a closer look on it when you are in noisier environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging specialist<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging menu is yet another part of the Symbian S60 UI that hasn't been modified at all compared to what we saw on Nokia 5800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N97 mini supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. They all share a common intuitive editor which by this point should be quite familiar to everyone. When composing an SMS, a counter is displayed of characters left to the limit of 160. An indicator in brackets is showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you insert some multimedia content, or an email address is inserted as recipient, the counter is replaced by a data counter showing the size of your email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N97 mini also features the dedicated editor for instant recording of audio messages. Much like with Symbian S60 v3.2 you can either record the message on the spot or use a sound clip from the phone memory. The interface of all the messengers is quite similar too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Delivery reports can be turned on - they pop up once the message reaches the addressee, and are then saved in a separate folder in the messaging sub-menu. When you are exiting the message editor without having sent the message, you get prompted to save it in Drafts or discard it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here might just be the right time to mention the input options on Nokia N97 mini. The handset offers a standard alphanumeric on-screen keypad in both portrait and landscape mode. There's no on-screen QWERTY, either full or the SureType-like version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course the hardware QWERTY is here to solve all your problems. It's just three rows and you need to use the function key for accessing the numbers and symbols, but that's no biggie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the N97 mini offers handwriting recognition, which did a rather decent job, recognizing almost all the letters we scribbled in the box. You can improve its performance by taking the handwriting training - where you actually show the handset how you write each different letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, able to meet almost any emailing needs. The easy setup we found in the latest Nokia handsets is also available with the N97 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your username and password to start enjoying email on the go. The phone downloads all the needed settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, it now prompts choosing whether you prefer POP or IMAP access to mail providers that support both. With the previous version selection was automatic. Nicely done!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia N97 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available. This can save you some data traffic charges since you can use the next available WLAN connection instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature that we really like is the ability to subscribe to different folders of the email account, like the Starred folder in Gmail. This can be very helpful if you've set up filters to automatically move messages to specific folders and keep your Inbox clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments, signatures and generally, you can hardly think of something important that the Nokia N97 mini lacks. Furthermore with a screen resolution like this reading your emails is easy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file manager is yet another aspect where the pedigree counts big time. With the soft keys at the bottom you can almost forget that you are looking at a new device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Symbian file management system has been top notch for quite a while now, and you can hardly think of anything to change. The application can basically do anything you can think of with your files - moving, copying renaming, sorting or sending - you name it. You can also password-protect your memory card if you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The searching for a specific file or directory is also available with the phone. All you need to remember is a part of the desired name and where it was located (phone memory or memory card) the Nokia N97 mini will find it in no time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery - not bad, but not great either<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of Nokia N97 mini is yet another part of its interface that hasn't been dramatically changed compared to non-touch Symbian predecessors. It has neither the swanky 3D view mode, nor the customizable slideshow we are used to seeing in the Nseries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go through your pictures (and videos as well) by sweeping your finger across the screen. Kinetic scrolling is enabled in the gallery view as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opting between portrait and landscape mode is automatic, thanks to the built-in accelerometer. Unless you have that feature disabled, all you need to do to switch modes is to flip the phone sideways (or just to slide out the QWERTY keyboard).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image zoom is controlled via either the volume rocker or an on-screen touch slider. In all other cases, images are displayed full screen. After you've cheked the details, to go to the next photo you always have to zoom all the way back, which might get annoying if you zoom in to often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, picture browsing is relatively fast, but the zooming is somewhat slow at least on the initial zooming step. The panning is worse than HTC's latest models and many of the other similar devices.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player (identical to the 5800 XpressMusic one) is very similar to the S60 3rd edition versions. A few cosmetic changes here and there and touch-optimization is all that sets it apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that the music player isn't capable enough or something - it surely has more than enough functionality. However some more eye-candy would have been quite welcome. After all, touch interfaces are usually mostly about being fun to use and nice to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is automatically sorted by artist, album, genre and composer and searching tracks by gradual typing is available. You can also create your own playlists in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The process of adding tracks to the library is as simple as choosing the refresh option. You won't need to do that if you upload the music via the proprietary PC Suite application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the huge number of supported formats you will hardly ever come across an audio file that the phone won't handle. Album art is also supported and if you don't like the default sound of the device you can enhance it by applying one of the five equalizer presets and if they seem insufficient you can create new ones in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case a tab appears on the stand-by screen indicating the currently running track.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Splendid audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just as we expected, the audio output of Nokia N97 mini differs little from the excellent Nokia N97. The slight change is the intemodulation distortion, which reduced in half and is now only slightly below average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset did excellently in all other parts of our test, achieving some excellent scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response of the N97 mini is almost identical to the one delivered by Nokia N97. It is pretty close to the perfect, the greatest deviating being only 0.32dB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings are also very good, comparable to the best in class. Here go the results so you can compare it to some of the other handsets we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N97 mini vs Nokia N97 frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about our audio quality test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No DivX and XviD dooms video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Watching a video on the Nokia N97 mini is generally a pleasure due to the relatively big screen. The built-in video player has decent functionality but only supports a very limited number of codecs, no DivX and XviD out of the box. As to third party solutions, mixed success is reported in terms of getting compatible players to run on the 5800 XpressMusic or the N97 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia PC suite, actually Ovi Suite now, has a built-in application that automatically converts all kinds of video files to the format and resolution your phone supports. The automatic converter though seems to compress the videos too much even at the highest quality setting and they look over pixilated but so far it's the easiest way of getting video to your Nokia touch handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player itself only works in fullscreen landscape mode but, since anything else would have made the widescreen display useless, this is understandable. When in fullscreen, a press on the screen shows the controls which are normally hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The amply sized high-res screen is also more than welcome for truly enjoying your clips. With QWERTY keyboard slid out, the Nokia N97 mini looks just like made for video watching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia have called their video app (which is actually a Real player in disguise) Video &amp; TV but as it turns out, the TV is actually videos that you can stream from Nokia or Reuters. One can only wonder how YouTube was left out of this streaming video equation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio comes with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia N97 mini has a neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you travel the N97 mini will take care of auto-switching to the frequencies of your selected radio station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RDS is the best part of Nokia N97 mini FM radio. The radio station name gets displayed with cool effects across the whole screen, while the rest of the RDS readings are printed in nicely legible text on a line at the bottom. Perhaps we would have preferred this font a bit larger, but it doesn't really matter that much.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The camera has its ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N97 mini has a 5 MP camera with a maximum image resolution of 2592x1944 pixels. Carl Zeiss optics and the dual-LED flash promise nice photos with a lot of detail. Let's see is it true.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is similar to the one found in 5800 XpressMusic and a carbon copy of the one in N97 - the few changes made are hardly for the better. All the settings are squeezed in a common menu, except for the flash, which has its own dedicated shortcut. We understand that a tabular layout isn't the easiest of thing this kind of devices but some of the more important features could have had their own shortcuts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the range of settings that the Nokia N97 mini offers is extensive enough: from manual white balance and ISO to exposure compensation, sharpness and contrast. Various effects are also at hand, labeled as Color Tones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, which needed a firmware update for the purpose, in N97 mini camera geo-tagging is present out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N97 mini lacks all the modern features that the other competing manufacturers are using such as face detection, smile detection and even blink prevention - not to mention in-camera face retouching or the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N97 mini viewfinder doesn't occupy the whole screen - a bar on the right is reserved for the touch controls. You have a settings button that launches a semi-transparent overlay of all available shooting options, a dedicated Flash button and an on-screen shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen shutter key seems absolutely redundant - it doesn't have a half press/full press action to properly handle auto focus. It would've been way better to have a Quick Settings button instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality is pretty decent in our books. First of all the picture detail is enough to qualify the photo as a very nice one. The next thing is the noise reduction algorithm is mature enough and finds a good balance between noise levels and detail. There is no purple fringing and the white balance and auto ISO settings worked just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there is one thing to complain about in the Nokia N97 mini photos, it would be the color balance. Most of the photos have generally warmer colors and the yellow tint is at times too much to swallow. Bear in mind though that quite a lot point and shoot cameras are tuned to reproduce colors warmer than they really are since this makes the photos look more vibrant and appealing to the end-users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dynamic range is also not quite impressive with highlight clipping a bit more frequent that we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there go some more photo samples from the N97 mini camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia N97 mini. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface doesn't differ from the still camera much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N97 video capture quality is OK. Colors and white balance turn out just fine, but the compression seems too aggressive in most of the clips and produces many noticeable video artifacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus the other manufacturers are already offering better video quality at higher resolution - take Samsung, for instance, and their Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH or even Omnia HD. Not to mention the 120fps and slow-motion videos that are already standard issue stuff on the higher segment LG and Samsung phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two samples from the Nokia N97 mini:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample 1, VGA@30fps Sample 2, nHD@30fps</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in essence, Nokia N97 mini offers a three-year old camera technology remixed as a brand fresh product for quite a steep price tag. Image quality is still among the top-of-the-line but for a 5 megapixel cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Five megapixels don't count as high-end anymore, not to mention the lack of all the current popular features such as face detection, tracking or manual focus, touch focus, smile shutter, blink detection and the likes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording is another area where Nokia have made no progress for the past several years. So if you've set your eyes on N97, we really hope that the camera is not the most important feature for you as Omnia HD goes for pretty much the same asking price.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity reaches for perfection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones are usually well-heeled in terms of connectivity. Nokia N97 mini makes no exception: all contemporary means of data transfer are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All kinds of network connectivity are at the user disposal - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSDPA. Both the 2G and 3G connections are quad-band, making the N97 mini quite the global phone. There are some carriers with rare frequencies that are not supported, but for the most part you should enjoy the speediest connectivity in the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both USB and Bluetooth are version 2.0 and the latter naturally also sports A2DP. Wi-Fi with UPnP support is also at hand. There is no shortcut key for the Wi-Fi manager, but it can be easily found in the Connectivity menu and connecting to a WLAN network is two taps away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia N97 mini has a memory card slot, which can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates and can take up to 16GB cards.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser needs some tuning<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser of Nokia N97 mini is about the same as on the 5800 XpressMusic. It's a nice browser indeed, but hardly as touch-optimized as we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panning and kinetic scrolling are the only things that are done by sweep gestures here, and zoom/out zoom are controlled by tapping on the screen twice. There's a zoom bar for smoother zooming, but using it requires too many taps. There are no options for fit-to-width or fit-to-height, which makes convenient positioning of the text on screen a hard job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an overview mode (a minimap), but bringing it up requires two taps, which is exactly one more than it should have been. And while the browser has support for multiple pages opened at the same time, this only works for popups - you can't open a new tab manually and dial in a new web address in a second tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the page rendering algorithm is quite good, making all the pages look as if browsed from a desktop PC. The high resolution is also a welcome bonus here, as it allows more content to fit on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the web browser has full support for both Flash and Java, which means that you can enjoy flash videos straight from your browser without having to use the mobile versions of sites like YouTube (which was recently redesigned by the way).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, generally speaking, the second S60 touch-browser is nicely equipped but fails to satisfy some common ergonomics shortcomings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S60 organizer didn't obviously get too much effort beyond the actual touch optimization. Well, developers were right up to a point but, given the progress of most competitors, some new functionality would have been nice - like copy/paste of events in the calendar or a new calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and to-do, which allows you to check up all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are the same four types of events available for setting up as on S60 3rd edition - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word, Excel and PowerPoint files seamlessly. The PDF viewer was preinstalled on our unit but it's only 15-days trial version (duh!) and after that you need to buy it from the Nokia download center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unluckily, editing documents is not supported by the included Quickoffice version. If you would like editing enabled you will have to get the upgrade from the Nokia Download center for a fee.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Active notes is advanced application for managing notes. It allows you to attach pictures, sound files or video clips to your memo and has nice and touch-friendly user interface. It's not so daily used app, but still it will find its fans for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go. This is quite convenient for, say, setting up your wake-up alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, the number of alarms is not limited. Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone, much like with the Nokia 8800 Arte and 5800 XpressMusic.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No games onboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are no preinstalled games on the Nokia N97 mini. None. Not even the so popular Snakes. That's a real shame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ovi Store has free games to offer, but if you're going to put a Games shortcut on the top level of the main menu, like Nokia did here, they should have at least preloaded a couple of those titles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Maps 3.0 comes to back up the GPS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N97 mini comes with a built-in GPS receiver and judging on our experience it's a sensitive unit but nothing spectacular. The handset managed to acquire satellite lock from cold start in about good 8-10 minutes upon the first attempt (A-GPS turned off at the time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5800 XpressMusic had it quicker, but still after you get the satellite lock, keeing it locked is not an issue for N97 mini even in dense urban environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large high-resolution screen sounds like a serious premise for reasonable use as a dedicated navigation unit. Unfortunately, the N97 mini has only 10-day trial voice guided navigation (region dependant) and you need to pay for more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with Ovi Maps 3.0 Touch preinstalled (the rebranded Nokia Mpas). As you might have guessed this is merely a touch-enabled version of the standard Nokia Maps 3.0 application. It offers extensive map coverage for free but you do need to pay for most of its extra features such as traffic information or city guides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we just mentioned you will also have to buy the voice-guided navigation license, should you pick the application for the purpose. At least the actual purchase itself is quite simple directly via the phone interface. If you prefer an alternative navigation software, you might want to carefully look around for a compatible version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-enabled Ovi Maps application itself is doing pretty well in terms of features too. It has four different view modes including satellite and hybrid maps. Those however do need an internet connection. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Route selection can be set to either fastest or shortest. The app is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the gripes we had with Maps 2.0 was the lack of "Go to my location" shortcut On the positive side, panning and zooming in the maps is really fast and the high-res screen is capable of showing quite a lot of data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall impression with GPS navigation on Nokia N97 mini is positive but, having in mind that a 1-year voice-guided navigation costs a lot and we are not sure whether many people will go for that. But who knows - with an ample screen like that it might easily replace a standalone navigation system.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Third-party applications and Ovi Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the 5800 XpressMusic first launched, there were very few third party applications available. But now, the S60 5th edition army has grown in numbers and the Ovi Store is fully operational and hosts over a thousand apps and games compatible with the N97 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the Ovi Store, you can choose between several sections - Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization, Recommended and of course, My Stuff, which shows you the apps you've already installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Ovi Store client is simple - a list with the name and logo for each app (or podcast, or whatever), the category it's in (Entertainment, Utilities, etc), price and a three star rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting an app, gives you more details - a description, info on size, reviews by people who have tried it, the ability to write a review yourself or sent the description page to a friend, a list of related apps and a Report issue button, which helps you report fraud, spam, abuse, etc., but not bug reports or feature requests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching the Store is quite easy if the Recommended section and the Related apps list doesn't get you what you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Nokia N97 mini comes preinstalled with a load of third party applications. Some of them are very handy tools for reading news, handling social networks, weather forecasts, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, since this is Symbian we are talking about, you can also pay a visit to some of the numerous sites for software available online. Here is one to get you started, while a simple Google search will show you the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download the apps straight from your phone or from your desktop computer and than transfer them as you find fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Nokia Download! is still available, but when we tried it, it failed to load the load the list of available content. It's obsolete now, anyway.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Preinstalled application keep you connected, informed and entertained<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Drawing is a new and simple piece of software that lets you draw stuff with different colors and thickness of the pencil.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>JoikuSpot Light is a free limited edition of JoikuSpot that shares your phone's 3G internet connection over WiFi (WLAN) to laptops and other WiFi devices. For a full feature set, you have to purchase the full JoikuSpot Premium at the Ovi Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trial version on Nokia N97 mini supports only HTTP browsing, whereas the Premium one has more secure browsing plus VPN support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>World Traveler is a handful open platform application developed by Psiloc that is aimed to make the traveler's life easier. The program offers four services - weather, world clock, currencies, and world map. More about this piece of software to be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AccuWeather for Nokia N97 mini is a Widget, which provides users with weather information for global locations including current conditions, 4-day forecasts, radar or satellite images, 15-day calendar view for a quick check of upcoming weather, hourly forecasts in graph format for visual display of temperature and conditions. It is also displayed on the home screen tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Amazon is a simple application with different categories. There is also a search engine, which opens results directly in the Amazon site. You are also allowed to choose in which country you'd like to look for an item, which is great for the local buyers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AP Mobile, which was announced this month with the launch of Nokia N97, is an application that enables users to choose their news, offering personalized delivery of content set according to their preferences. Consumers can scroll through stories and AP photo galleries as well as watch AP videos. Interesting images, videos or news can be directly shared via Twitter or Delicious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bloomberg application brings you up to date financial information. It has four tabs - news, markets, my stocks, and search section. If you are into finances, you can find out more about it at their website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final noteworthy app is the Reuters Slideshow, which gets you galleries from the mobile version of Reuters.com. It's not a news application, it just displays images from the several available categories with short explanatory texts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some more of the preinstalled applications:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Elle application serves up news bits from the fashion world, interviews, horoscopes and lots and lots of photos. CNN Video is a more serious app, which lets you watch videos from CNN news reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ESPNsoccernet is invaluable to soccer fans - it has schedules, news, results, everything about soccer championships around the world. Metro is yet another source of world news.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there are other apps, but you get the point - the Nokia N97 mini comes with just about the most preloaded apps we've seen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N97 mini is a very versatile full-featured device, nicely balanced with with hardly any serious holes in its specs sheet. What's best about it, is that "mini" moniker is certainly not a negative one. The N97 mini is in the size range of the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and it's in fact thinner despite the slide out keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N97 mini build quality and materials are on a exacting high level and we're glad the S60 touch UI is moving forward too. The UI has gone a long way since we first tried it on the 5800. Granted, there are still some inconsistencies and home screen widgets and flick scrolling or not, some people will scoff at the oddities of the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's good about the relatively new OS edition is that the Ovi Store is really picking up speed, which is great news for the N97 mini. The key aspect of an app store is that it lets users make full use of their phone. Without one a smartphone is pretty much left high and dry unless you go the extra length of searching and researching third party apps. The current selection of apps available for S60 5th is growing and the in-store experience is similar to what Android offers - and that's a compliment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, all that being said, it's time we introduce the competition. The Motorola MILESTONE (or DROID in the US), certainly has drool-worthy features. Android 2.0 Eclair is stirring up a lot of excitement, although not getting the free Google Maps Navigation is a hard blow (it's US only for now). The rest of the specs though will certainly make the N97 mini sweat it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it's the social networking features that you're after, the Motorola DEXT is another Android alternative. Instead of Eclair, it runs the previous incaranation of the OS, but it's seriously spiced up with Motorola's MOTOBLUR interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 doesn't have the 5MP camera but the bigger, high resolution screen and great Office integration will win over the business crowd. It's a bit on the heavy side, and we didn't quite like that about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola MILESTONE ? Motorola DEXT ? HTC Touch Pro2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO (another seriously large handset) fetches a premium price tag, but the appeal of a 3.5" WVGA AMOLED screen is undeniable. DivX support and Office document editing out of the box make it a phone that can do both work and play. And if these WinMo phones cross the price line you've set for yourself, check out the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1 - it's noticeably lighter on your wallet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung B7610 OmniaPRO ? Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's one for the maximalists - the current Nokia headliner, the N900. It blurs the lines between UMPC and smartphone to the point where buying two devices makes little sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N97 mini certainly lives up to the reputation its bigger brother already established. We certainly appreciated its solid and enjoyable user experience along with its minute and pocketable size and will certainly win the hearts of many Symbian users who will feel right at home with it.</paragraph>
