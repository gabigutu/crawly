			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView is the best cameraphone ever made. End of story. Now, how do you proceed from there? And why is this particular phone so hard to write about? How about because a picture is worth a thousand words and we just had a truckload of them in the mother of all shootouts? Or is it because 41 megapixels is more than five, eight, twelve, or the sum thereof, and there's no two ways about it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Close, but no cigar. What could've easily been an ode to Finnish awesomeness may be no more than a flash in the dark for struggling Nokia and the still-standing-against-all-odds Symbian. That's what makes it hard and we've been there with the Nokia N9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At different points in its history, Nokia has had the best-selling phone, the best business phone, the best gaming phone, the best cameraphone and the best smartphone. At one particular time, they even had all of the above in one go. Honest to god, if there ever was anything like the best are-you-kidding-me phone and the best gimme-a-break phone, they would've been runners-up at least. Yeah, they were that good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yes, the Nokia 808 PureView camera is that good. They wanted something to maybe, just maybe, match the most basic of compact digicams. And they did so well that it scared the living daylights (and the low light) out of a Micro Four Thirds camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes the Nokia 808 PureView.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 808 PureView has no business with cameraphones as we know them. It can look down at any of the smartphone flagships of the competition and make fun of their so-called advanced camera tricks. But guess what - it doesn't. It's so much better than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course the flipside is that the smartphone is not of the same order as the cameraphone. The Symbian-powered Nokia 808 PureView knows darn well it cannot match the quad-cores, HD screens and the app stores of the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, what's it then? Sort of the fat kid, and not too bright? It may as well be - but hang on. You may have a use for a sharpshooter in your team. Stuff movies are made of. Grabs you by the heart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView has a whole review ahead and we don't think it's going to try and impress anyone, or make them change their mind. But you'd do well to pay attention. This is a phone that knows what it's doing and does it well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView comes with all the essential accessories in the box. Ours came with a rather big charger to be used with a data and charging USB cable. We would've liked the stylish round chargers of the N9 and the Lumia line, but it's not a big deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo headset has a Call key built-in and comes with a choice of three different sets of earbuds of different sizes. An NFC sticker and a leather wrist strap with suede padding complete the contents of the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 808 PureView 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's the Nokia 808 PureView in all its glory. It's not exactly fresh out of the gym, and the massive camera bump makes it look like it's been in an accident. Multiple accidents? It's certainly not a bad-looking fella, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia are sticking to the classic white and black, and red for special occasions, we presume. No fancy paintjobs like pink and lime. Also gone is the full-metal body of the N8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all plastic build is not necessarily a bad thing, considering that at 169g the 808 PureView competes in the super heavyweight division. Plastic was definitely the way to go here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView has a surprisingly coarse finish that almost feels like machined metal, only not as cold. It is nice to the touch and has great grip, which is a must for such a hefty, and top-heavy, piece of gear. We don't miss the aluminum unibody of the N8 because, believe it or not, the 808 PureView easily puts any metal-clad phone to shame. The feel is solid, bordering on lethal. The Nokia 808 PureView desperately lacks sophistication but it doesn't feel like it'll break in your hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not hard to guess that this kind of camera will require plenty of extra space. At 123.9 x 60.2 x 13.9 mm, the 808 PureView is just a millimeter thicker than the Nokia N8, but that's not taking into account the large hump at the back. At its thickest part, where the camera is, the 808 PureView is 18mm deep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the size and weight, the device doesn't feel weird in the hand. It didn't take long to learn how to balance the top-heavy phone in portrait. That's where the grippy finish of the rear was most welcome. One scenario where it's not the most comfortable of handsets is typing in landscape mode. And even that's not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the secondary camera for video calls, alongside the proximity and ambient light sensors, and a centrally placed earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keeping up with the times, the 808 PureView packs a 4" AMOLED display, with a layer of Gorilla Glass for extra protection. It's a nice choice for screen meant for viewing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, assuming at some point you will stop ogling the monstrous camera at the back, the front is where your attention will be. Unfortunately, Nokia could've done better than nHD resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>360 x 640 pixel screens weren't exactly top of the line two years ago, and they most certainly aren't today. The display has grown up to 4 inches, taking the pixel density down to 184 ppi. With some rival smartphones able to offer nearly twice this number, the 808 PureView has no excuses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But not everything is ruined. AMOLED offers great sunlight legibility and perfect indoor performance. Not least, the aspect ratio is spot on 16:9. Deep blacks and saturated colors are the technology's trademark features. Although it's not as impressive as Samsung's SuperAMOLED Plus, it's more than competitive elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's how the Nokia 808 PureView did in our dedicated display test. We couldn't measure the values at 50% brightness since the ambient light sensor couldn't be turned off. You can learn more about the testing process over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conducted our usual sunlight legiblity test on the Nokia 808 PureView and it ended up our new champion. The contrast ratio of the ClearBlack AMOLED mounted on the smartphone in strong light is way better than anything we've seen so far.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We zoomed into the display using our digital microscope so you can get a better idea of how the pixels are arranged, and how big they are. Check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Nokia 808 PureView display matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the secondary camera for video calls, alongside the proximity and ambient light sensors, and a centrally placed earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the classic layout of Nokia Belle buttons - call keys on either side of a Menu button. They all share a single piece but the three keys are solid on press nonetheless. There's no hardware back button, soft key is the only way to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone packs the volume rocker, the screen lock slider and the dedicated camera key. All of them have a kind of metal finish and feel great on press. The camera key is very soft upon a half press, getting a bit stiff to push all the way down. We like it that way and we're even more impressed with the speed with which the camera responds. Pressing the shutter key with the screen locked launches the camera in a mere second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left hand-side doesn't feature any controls or ports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make up for this, the top side of the phone accommodates all the ports. There's the 3.5mm headphone jack, microUSB port for charging and data transfers and the microHDMI port for streaming to an HDTV or a monitor. The latter is hidden under a rubber lid to keep out dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the 808 PureView holds the microphone pinhole. It's also responsible for recording sound for the excellent videos the camera is making. But more on that later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The natural attention-grabber is the 41MP imaging sensor with PureView technology at the back. It sits in a large hump sharing the space with a large Xenon flash. The optical module is made of five elements, and the image sensor is massive. It's way bigger than the N8's, which in turn is way bigger than usual. The Xenon unit too needs plenty of space, so in the end, Nokia could've done a lot worse than the camera bulge at the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's where the loudspeaker grille is as well. At the bottom of the back panel there's a thin ridge, which is probably supposed to help with grip, but we found it to be purely ornamental. Maybe at some point they were considering a proper digicam-style grip but decided against it to avoid comparisons to the Samsung Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover reveals a standard 1400 mAh Li-Ion battery quoted at 6h 50 min of talk time and up to 540 hours of stand-by. The SIM compartment and microSD card slot are under it. The battery cover itself has an integrated NFC chip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: We ran our traditional battery test on the Nokia 808 PureView. It scored an endurance rating of 34 hours, with an impressive result in video playback and a decent web browsing result. In our talk test the phone lasted less than the advertised nearly 7 hours of talk time, instead depleting its battery in 5 hours and 16 minutes. You can find more details on the 808's battery performance over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All in all, you can tell the Nokia 808 PureView is built around the camera. The design simply follows suit. It may sound hard to believe for a rather chunky and heavy handset, made entirely of plastic, but Nokia are at their usual best with the build quality of their cameraphone flagship. The screen resolution is a bit of a low point but by no means a deal breaker. It's AMOLED after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many will find the camera bump rather ugly, but we think it adds to the phone's personality. Not exactly our ideal picture of a handsome phone, the 808 PureView feels rock solid and is more comfortable to handle than most would think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us past the break to see how Nokia Belle with Feature pack 1 fits into the equation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Belle gets a pack of features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia's smartphone OS, previously known as Symbian, has faded into the background of the smartphone scene, which is a shame since it finally caught up to the competition in terms of features with Belle and now we have Feature Pack 1 to polish it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's Nokia Belle FP1 on video because screenshots don't tell the whole story:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the biggest change in FP1 is that the CPU is clocked at 1.3GHz, which should be a good enough speed boost. There are new widgets too, as well as Dolby-enhanced sound, some Microsoft Apps along with updates to the browser and Nokia Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you get up to six homescreens and you can delete unneeded ones. Each homescreen has its own individual wallpaper, rather than one for all to share. A notable contrast with vanilla Android, the scrolling of homescreen panes is looped so you never need to go back from the last one. Auto-rotation of the homescreen is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets come in up to five sizes. In addition, you can also put shortcuts and contacts on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FP1 brings with it a number of new widgets. For example, you now get 3G, Offline, Bluetooth and Mobile Data on/off toggles in addition to the Wi-Fi on/off toggle you got with Belle. There's also a Mobile data tracker that is great for those on limited plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a couple of new clock widgets, a additional calendar widget, two music player widgets, Facebook and Twitter widgets, a DLNA server widget, Microsoft Apps widget, and a couple of weather widgets among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a widget or shortcut activates edit mode, but only for that widget/shortcut. You can't touch the others - there's no mode where you can edit everything at once (which seems a bit inconvenient). You can move, delete or (where available) access the settings of the selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pull-down status bar at the top of the screen is where notifications and status info wait for your attention, but you also get toggles for mobile data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This pull-down status bar is available on any screen so you can also quickly change a setting and look up new events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the homescreen has three virtual buttons - menu, dialer and homescreen settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, the main menu is now completely flat, at least by default - you could still manually create folders, if you like. You can't put folders within folders though (not that you'd want to do that anyway).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To help you navigate the crowded app drawer, there's a search feature, plus you can sort icons both alphabetically and manually. You can't drop a shortcut in a folder while arranging them though. To do that, you have to press and hold on a shortcut, choose Move to folder and then select the desired folder. There are also Add to homescreen and delete options here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way you move things around in Symbian isn't as streamlined and intuitive as it is in competing OSes and Feature Pack 1 has done nothing to change that. Also, the only way to add a folder to the homescreen is to first create it in the app drawer, which is less than ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager in Nokia Belle FP1 has changed though. It's still called out by pressing and holding the Menu key, but it now shows screenshots of the actual apps rather than their icons. You can barely fit two apps when the UI is in vertical orientation and four in landscape. The red X's lets you close apps that are no longer needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lightweight Symbian has always been a snappy OS even on limited (by today's standards) resources. The bump to 1.3GHz (older Belle phones ran at 1GHz tops) enables buttery smooth animations and transitions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Nokia 808 PureView you really don't notice you're running on a single-core processor. The app store battle is lost for the platform and in today's market, the apps are the main driving force behind smartphone sales.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We may be sad to see Symbian headed the way of the dodo bird, but the 808 PureView could be the grand sendoff an OS with such rich history deserves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Same old phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView comes with an old, but capable phonebook, which can easily be synced with your Exchange account. Contacts can be ordered by first or last name. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting some of your contacts as favorites moves them to the top of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can assign personal ringtones and videos to individual contacts. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have duplicated contacts (e.g. one from the SIM card and one from Exchange) you can merge them, similar to how it works on competing OSes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really nice touch when editing a contact is the option to enter their address by locating it on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The social network integration includes Facebook and Twitter, which should be fine for the vast majority of users. You can see the latest status update right from the contact info - or at least the first three lines of it. A tap on it brings you to a new screen where you can read the whole message and you get options to view the sender's profile and more updates . That takes a few seconds though as the Social app needs to load first.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Reception on the Nokia 808 is good and we didn't experience dropped calls. The phone features an extra microphone for active noise-cancellation. The dialer also supports video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer is smart dial-enabled, so you just punch in a few letters from the desired contact's name and select it from the list that comes up to initiate a call. There's speed dial too on the virtual dial pad. The final option for starting a call is via the shortcuts you can place on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is also enabled; it gets activated by pressing and holding the call key. It is fully speaker-independent and, as far as we can tell performs admirably, recognizing all the names we threw at it. In noisier environments though, its effectiveness might suffer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 has the neat accelerometer-based feature that lets you mute the ringer by turning the phone face down. That same turn-to-mute trick also works for snoozing the alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the screen is automatically disabled during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView took our traditional loudspeaker test scored a Good mark. More info on the test, as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging complete<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All your incoming messages arrive in a shared inbox and by default are displayed in threads. If you're old-school, you can view choose the folder view mode too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView relies on a shared editor for all the types of messages. Stuff like a character counter in SMS goes without saying. Insert some multimedia content and the message is automatically transformed into an MMS. In that case, the character counter turns into a data counter showing kilobytes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 automatically set up our Gmail account in no time, complete with Exchange Active Sync configuration. Usually, all you need is to enter a username and a password and you will be good to go. A few settings had to be entered manually for the Active Sync setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia 808.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can be sorted by various filters such as date, sender, subject, priority or even by attachments, search is enabled as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. For that you get two separate settings: syncing frequency and peak and off-peak sync times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments, signatures and basically everything you would normally need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen keyboard of the Nokia 808 PureView works as we've come to expect out of a modern smartphone. The 4" screen is big enough and the virtual keys have plenty of padding around them, making typing easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape mode offers bigger keys and you can activate word auto-completion, both of which speed up typing. Text auto-correction can be set between high, medium or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text fields fully support cut, copy and paste functionality. You can just swipe your finger to highlight some text and a popup shows up automatically to access those features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery and file management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery app in Nokia 808 PureView may look the same as before, but it has actually lost some functionality. Photos are displayed in a grid (3 columns) and you can scroll up and down (with kinetic scrolling, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can no longer select multiple photos or share them straight from the grid view. The gallery no longer offers the option to organize images into albums and even the View details option is gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can delete, crop, send or share photos with a handy Facebook shortcut available at the bottom of the screen. You can share a photo on Flickr too, but you have to go through the Share menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the images is usually amazingly smooth - you can zoom and pan around 38MP images and the 808 PureView won't break a sweat. Even flicking through hundreds of images in the grid view is fast and effortless. There are only rare occasions when large photos take a while to zoom, but it's nothing major and the overall performance is great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that Albums are gone, the only way to organize images is tags. Tags are visible between photos in the grid view and you can insert a new tag with a press and hold. Tags with the date are inserted automatically. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to jump straight to a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery offers simple editing options - adjusting image properties (including an auto-levels feature), cropping, rotating, flipping and resigning, along with adding effects, clipart and frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ColorizIt app is also available, which creates a specific effect - a black and white photo with parts of it in color. The Silent Film Director app let's you create old-school looking clips (like a 20's film with the characteristic silent movie soundtrack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Files app aboard the Nokia 808 is a capable and can basically do anything you want with your files - moving, copying, renaming, sorting, searching or sending - you name it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZIP manager also comes in handy when you get an archived file in the mail or need to send several files easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Dolby<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player features a Cover Flow-like interface in several places. You start off by picking an album off a list (or put the phone in landscape mode to browse the albums by their covers in 3D), after that you pick the song you want from the next list, with 3D album covers hovering just above if you change your mind and want another album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than Album, you can also browse songs by Genres or Playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface shows the album art on top (which you can swipe left or right to move between songs), below is the seek bar that lets you scrub through a song, under that are the playback controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have equalizer presets but no manual settings, along with Loudness and Balance settings. Feature Pack 1 brings Dolby Headphone sound enhancement, which has only two states - on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView features an FM radio transmitter, which allows you to broadcast to any FM radio receiver nearby (typically, your car's audio). You can set the frequency too, to avoid interferences on the current channel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio comes with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia 808 PureView comes with a neat and simple interface. You can skip preset and new stations alike with swipe gestures or you can use the virtual buttons. The radio has RDS support and automatic rescanning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it doesn't have is a built-in antenna, so you'll need to plug in headphones for the radio to work. That would have been a nice perk, but not having it isn't a huge loss.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView audio output is quite great, the handset doing quite well in both of our testing scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When attached to an active external equalizer, the 808 PureView got impressive scores all over the place. Its volume level was decently high too, so there's nothing to frown at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo crosstalk reading got the usual hit when when headphones came into play, but apart from that and the increased intermodulation distortion, everytihng remained great. A very solid overall performance indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here comes the table so you can see for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 808 PureView frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable video player with no settings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView handled practically every video file we tried - DivX, XviD, AVI, MKV, MP4 - there's nothing the phone is afraid of. Even 1080p videos played smoothly. Videos with AC3 or DTS sound worked too, even if they trip up most other smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The media player works in fullscreen landscape mode. The beautiful screen with native 16:9 aspect is also more than welcome for truly enjoying your videos - even in broad daylight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the nHD resolution doesn't do most videos justice, you'll need a microHDMI cable and an HDTV. The video player will automatically detect subtitles and load them up too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no options or settings available for the subtitles. Sure, they just work fine most of the time, but if you need to change the encoding, adjust their size or anything else, you're out of luck.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera interface and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera is the main reason everyone is interested in the Nokia 808 PureView. It was off to a flying start after emerging victorious from our blind test, comfortably beating the Olympus E-PL2, and matching the detail levels of our 5D Mark III DSLR so it seems Nokia got everything right here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1/1.2" image sensor has 41MP resolution, but the maximum resolution for still photos is 38MP in 4:3 mode and 34MP in 16:9 mode. The camera also packs a powerful xenon flash, one of the very few recent smartphones to offer this feature. There's also a regular flash that helps during focusing and works as a video light. It's this one too that serves as a torch, upon holding down the lock slider. Another rare feature is the built-in neutral density filter, which helps in overly bright scenes where the wide-aperture camera would be struggling with the excessively high shutter speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is pretty straightforward. Along the right edge of the viewfinder you'll find the still/video camera toggle, the virtual shutter and the gallery shortcut. There's a setting shortcut in the top middle that is labeled with the currently enabled mode (e.g. "C2 8MP" is custom setting #2, 8MP resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left edge of the camera changes depending on which mode you enable - it can be as little as a flash mode setting or as much as a column of five settings you can adjust manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've mentioned modes a couple of times now and it's time to give them the run over. There are three modes to choose from - Automatic (for the pure point &amp; shoot experience), Scenes (if you want some control) and Creative (which puts you in the driver's seat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Except in Full resolution, all other modes get you the enormous benefit of having pixel oversampling and the impressive loss-less digital zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Automatic mode produces 5 megapixel images, using the PureView oversampling technology, which are of pretty good quality and have a file size that makes them easy to share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scenes let you give the phone a hint about what it's photographing - snow (a lot of white reflective surface), spotlight (a dark stage with the band in the bright spotlight) and so on and are good enough if you're in a hurry. There's instant preview how the photo will look if you go for the selected scene. Just like automatic mode, Scenes produces 5MP 16:9 photos and you can't change that. You photos are still a product of the oversampling technology and you still have control over the loss-less digital zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we get to Creative mode - it gives you full control of the camera and you can pick what sort of a resolution you'd like the camera to produce. You can go for the full-resolution mode or keep to the PureView mode to enjoy extra sharp and noise-free images thanks to oversampling. PureView produces 5MP photos by default, but you can choose 3MP or 8MP as well. Loss-less zoom is present in the three resolution modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has devised a handy and clever way to zoom that they call "Slide zoom". You put your finger on the screen and drag up to zoom in and down to zoom out. You can use the volume rocker too. How much you can zoom in depends on the resolution you've chosen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The implemented zooming gesture allows you to keep both hands on the phone and zoom using your thumb only. This reduces camera shake, which can make the difference between a tack-sharp image and a blurry mess when you have zoomed in too far in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don't worry - the slide zoom doesn't mean you don't get touch focus. You do - in fact, you can tap and hold on the viewfinder to get several focus modes (Automatic, Close-up, Hyperfocal and Infinity).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creative mode also lets you pick the aspect ratio of the photos (4:3 or 16:9), JPEG quality (Normal and Superfine), color tones (Normal, Vivid, Sepia, Black &amp; White), capture mode (Normal, Bracketing, Interval, Self timer) and finally, sliders for saturation, contrast and sharpness. You can also enable a viewfinder grid, control the focus assist lamp and the waking the phone with the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Creative mode, you also get access to several controls in the viewfinder. You can adjust the exposure compensation (and you get a histogram while doing so, which is really cool), set the ISO (from 50 to 1600), change the flash mode, the white balance and the neutral density filter (which can be set to Off, Automatic and On).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whew, that's a ton of settings that you have access to. Luckily, you can save up to three custom settings and later quickly access any of the setups you like. They are labeled C1, C2 and C3 and the active setting is modified each time you change anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Nokia 808 PureView has a relatively long focal length for a phone - 8.02mm, which combined with the f/2.4 aperture makes for some noticeably shallower depth of field and allows for cool bokeh effects (and those are real, not down to software processing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downside of this is that the focus error, which are quite frequent on smartphones are way easier to spot here. While on other smartphones even if the autofocus misses by a few centimeters, the subject will still be well focused, this is not always the case with the 808 PureView.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another imperfection of the Nokia 808 lens is their relatively large minimal focus distance. This means that even in macro mode, the PureView is unable to focus on anything that's less than 20cm away from its lens. This means that its macro capabilities aren't nearly as good as those on some competitors, but you can, at times, make up for that if you use the zoom.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality and comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've shot camera samples in both 8MP PureView mode and at full resolution, and we'll cover the quality of both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the full resolution photos, as those give you the most flexibility. Even without the benefit of oversampling, the Nokia 808 PureView sensor produces photos with very little noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise is kept low and the level of detail is amazing. This is enhanced by the sheer number of pixels available - when you open a full resolution photo and view it at 100%, you get much closer to the subject than with any other phone or even most digicams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This lets you observe minute details and allows you to reframe a shot after the fact. You can easily crop an 8MP image out of a full-res shot and get an image of vastly higher quality than any regular 8MP phone camera can produce.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white balance is very accurate and photos have pleasing colors, though they feel a little muted. The camera also manages to adjust the exposure very well on its own with minimal over and under exposure. We noticed no fringing or oversharpening either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView acts really easy on post-processing when you pick full resolution mode. There's plenty of headroom for tweaking the photos in your favorite image editing program, fiddling with colors, levels and sharpness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's see how things go when we enable PureView mode. The oversampling can almost completely get rid of noise while producing a stunning amount of fine detail. Color rendering isn't affected by the PureView mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's take a look at how the Nokia 808 PureView does in our Photo quality comparison tool in its full-res 38MP mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It easily tops our synthetic resolution chart. There is some loss of detail compared to what's actually on the chart, but it's only really noticeable in the small horizontal lines next to the GSMArena logo (an area of the chart that we don't usually consider in our analyses since it's way beyond the resolving capabilities of most phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next chart shows how little the noise reduction takes away - in the gravel and grass patches you can see the blades of grass and small stones, which usually get smeared away. The color squares look great too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The automatic white balance was unfazed by the switch to artificial lighting for the third chart. There's plenty of detail in the flowers and the girls' hair, which usually get lost to noise reduction. Colors look okay too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 808 PureView against Nokia N8 and Samsung Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, here's the 808 PureView against a couple of big-sensor cameras - the Canon 5D Mk II and the Olympus E-450.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 808 PureView against Canon 5D Mk II and Olympus E-450</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget that the photo compare tool offers an option to scale the images to help you compare different native resolutions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've found that downsampling full resolution photos in an image editing program produces results of comparable quality to shooting in PureView, so you might be tempted to shoot at full-res and crop/downsize later just for the extra flexibility of having much more pixels to re-frame your shots later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's alright but you should consider that shooting in full resolution takes longer - 8MP PureView photos are snapped in under a second, while 38MP shots might take 2-3 seconds. Then there's the file size - 8MP shots clock in at 2-3MB, while 38MP ones are 10-11MB, which is an important consideration if you're going to be sharing those photos or posting them online.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Low-light performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We found the Nokia 808 PureView low-light performance worthy of a review of its own. You can read the really detailed analysis there, but here's the short version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In dim lighting the Nokia 808 PureView really makes its large sensor count and blows competition out of the water. In its full-res 38MP mode it does allow the noise to raise its ugly head, but still captures amazingly detailed photos. What's even better, the noise is of the far more acceptable luminance type and not the colored chormatic noise typical for most smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switch to the lower-res 8MP mode and you get virtually noise-free images up to ISO 400 and usable ones even at ISO800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We started with testing the xenon flash mounted on the 808 PureView, which Nokia claims is twice more powerful than the one on the N8. We were hardly surprised that it allowed us to capture some pretty impressive photos in both 38MP and 8MP modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 808 PureView continued its great streak even after we disabled the flash. The smartphone managed to once again put the Galaxy S III to shame, and even managed to hold its ground against the Olympus E-PL2 Micro Four Thirds camera and the Canon 550D DSLR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A warning is due here, though. When things get extremely dark, the Nokia 808 PureView sometimes selects a shutter speed of 1/16 or even lower, which means that images are likely to come out blurry due to both camera shake and motion blur. If the PureView opted for a higher ISO setting instead, you would have ended up with slightly noisier but sharper images and we think that would be the better decision.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally you can enter creative mode and set the ISO manually, thus allowing the Nokia 808 to select a higher shutter speed, but since the currently selected speed isn't indicated anywhere on the viewfinder, there's no way of telling when you need to do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, the Nokia 808 PureView low-light performance isn't as good as its specs suggest - it's way better than that and it certainly exceeded our expectations. And it's not just stills either - the 1080p footage captured in low-light environments comes out really great too. Just check out the following comparison to see what we are talking about.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera interface and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface looks a lot like the still camera. You still get Automatic, Scenes and Creative modes and their settings are similar to those of their still imaging counterparts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get two extra settings - you can toggle the Video light and the Continuous Autofocus (CAF). If CAF starts hunting for autofocus too often, you can disable it. This will enable Hyperfocal mode, which should keep most things in focus (unless they are less than a meter from the camera).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With creative mode, you can pick from several resolutions and framerates. The resolution settings are 1080p, 720p and 360p. For framerates you get the most popular options - 30fps, 25fps, 24fps and 15fps. This lets you play cinematographer with 1080p@24fps or put the 808 PureView through the indignity of shooting a 360p@15fps video for an MMS message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The really good news is that zooming works in video mode too, even during recording. In the highest resolution mode you get up to 4x lossless digital zoom and that number even goes up as the resolution goes down - 6x for 720p and a whopping 12x for 360p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has taken great care to produce the best video quality possible. 1080p videos are shot at 25Mbps encoded with H.264 high-profile and the audio recording has received a lot of attention too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia's Rich Recording technology allows the 808 PureView to record both very low frequencies and very loud sounds (up to 140-145dB) without distortion - they claim it produces "almost CD quality" audio.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality and comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The still photography skills of the Nokia 808 PureView get the most attention with the astronomically high resolution. The 1080p videos that the phone shoots might not beat the competition by numbers alone, but that huge sensor sure is a great thing to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the user interface video on page 3 of this very article was shot on a Nokia 808 PureView. You can find more details on this experiment of ours over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 files. The 1080p@30fps came out with a bitrate of 20-21Mbps, but a more dynamic scene should see an increase in that number. The sound is recorded in stereo with 129 Kbps bitrate and a sampling rate of 48 kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos themselves are excellent: smooth, free of noise and with great level of detail. Color rendering is identical to the one in still images, which is to say accurate, but a bit undersaturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found that the continuous autofocus would trigger a bit too often - it's quick and unobtrusive, but you still might want to disable it. Luckily, you can do that straight from the viewfinder even in the middle of recording a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p @ 30fps videos are shot with 10-11Mbps framerate and look pretty amazing themselves. Not to mention that they allow for even more zooming action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download this 1080p@30fps (0:06s, 13.4MB) video sample and this 720p@30fps (0:07s, 9MB) sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to our Video quality comparison, the Nokia 808 PureView videos came out with rather cool colors under the artificial light in our studio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The texture of the material that we use for the fake sky in the background is visible, which is good (too aggressive noise reduction and compression get the better of it in most phones), but surprisingly it's not quite the best. The grass and the faux wooden pieces of the Ferris wheel look great though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under poor lighting, the large sensor helps the Nokia 808 PureView but there is evident loss of quality. The texture of the 'sky' is still visible in places and there's practically no noise here. However, the faux wooden pieces are smeared away and the grass doesn't look too good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The synthetic resolution chart shows the Nokia 808 PureView measures up to the best in class, but there's no big advantage here like in still photography.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 808 PureView against Apple iPhone 4S and Samsung Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's how the 808 PureView compares to the Canon 5D Mk II DSLR and the Sony DSC-H5X point-and-shoot, both of which are highly rated for their video recording capabilities (in their respective classes, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia 808 PureView against Canon 5D Mk II DSLR and Sony DSC-H5X </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView is easily one of the best phones for recording video in terms of quality. It didn't blow the competition out of the water, though. Still, it has more to offer aspiring film makers - the fine control over resolution, framerate, focus and image setting is unmatched by any other phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The killer feature of the Nokia 808 PureView is the lossless digital zoom - up to almost 4x if you shoot at 1080p. We should clarify "lossless" - you don't lose quality when zooming in (as with other digital zoom methods), but you gradually lose the advantage that oversampling gives you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, at maximum zoom you don't get the tack sharp, detail rich imagery you usually get, but the results are still pretty good and vastly superior to any digital zoom. And keep in mind that 3x-4x zoom is typical for point-and-shoots, so the 808 PureView has them matched here. Drop down to 720p and you get 6x, which gets you into a higher price category of point-and-shoots, while maintaining the excellent quality. And you really gotta acknowledge the fact that at fully extended optical zoom these digicams see a sharpness penalty too. Not to mention their aperture becomes noticeably smaller thus letting less light in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot the resolution chart at no zoom and at full zoom, here's a crop that shows the difference in performance:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-round connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView has an expectedly impressive set of connectivity options. Starting off with the basics, you get a true worldwide-ready phone: quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and penta-band 3G with HSDPA (14.4Mbps) and HSUPA (5.76Mbps). Wherever there's a GSM network you'd get voice calls and data, which is anything but sluggish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is well covered too. You get Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi tethering thanks to the JoikuSpot app. Bluetooth 3.0 is on board with A2DP stereo, but unfortunately lacks an HS profile. There's USB with On-The-Go support for wired connectivity, which worked with everything we threw at it, except USB hubs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is increasingly popular of late and the PureView supports it. Pairing is as simple as you could possibly imagine, just put two NFC-enabled gadgets (usually, two smartphones) together and they will connect. Hooray, no more PIN codes!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sending stuff works the same way - select the files you want to send (one or many) and tap the two phones together. They'll handle the rest, including switching on the Bluetooth receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the microHDMI port that can output 1080p video with multi-channel audio (as long as the video source has that). Keep in mind you'll need to purchase an HDMI cable as there's isn't one in the retail package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A better web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the surface, the Feature Pack 1 browser hasn't seen much change. Underneath, however, Nokia has done a great job at expanding the HTML5 support and making pages load even faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top you have the URL bar, which auto-hides ones the page loads. Once you start typing a "Search for..." pop-up lets you choose one of several search engines (Google and Bing are offered in most locations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, you have a fixed row with five shortcuts - Back, Forward, Bookmarks, Tabs and Menu. The addition of the Tabs shortcut makes managing multiple pages easier - in earlier versions you had to go through the popup menu, involving a few extra clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports FlashLight 4. It felt fluid and fast when we panned around a page and zoomed in and out. We didn't really see any pages break in the browser either. Nokia has definitely brought up its browser a huge step forward thanks to the updated browser engine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian has a solid track record in the PIM department and the Nokia 808 PureView with Nokia Belle is no exception. Nokia has just tweaked a thing or two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different view modes - monthly, daily and a to-do list, which allows you to check all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are three types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has some specific fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync the phone's calendar with multiple online accounts and each gets its own color so that they're easy to tell apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView has multiple ways to deal with office documents. Quickoffice comes preloaded, as does the Offline Office from Microsoft. The Adobe PDF reader is also here to take care of those .PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the preinstalled Quickoffice version doesn't support editing, but don't fret, as Microsoft's own Office app doesn't have such limitations and is already available for Symbian free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator application is very familiar but it lacks the functionality of some of its competitors. The square root is the most advanced function it handles and this is hardly an achievement. If all you do with it is split the bill at the bar though, you're more than good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a dictionary, a voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. The good unit converter we've come to know from Symbian^1 is strangely gone but you can grab one yourselves at the Nokia store for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application can juggle as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, start and repeat time. As we already mentioned, thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone over.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView is quite a social gadget. The dedicated Social app is the hub for all things social - with support for the two most popular networks, Facebook and Twitter. You can have multiple accounts on each network but only one of each can be active at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook section offers a wide range of options with an easy to use, touch-optimized user interface. Posting a status update is as simple as attaching a photo or video (or shooting one on the spot) as well as adding geotagging data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Twitter is accessed via a similarly neat interface. There's a handy button to shorten links and you can attach photos and videos to your tweets as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text input field for status updates for both Facebook and Twitter covers only the top half of the screen and the portrait QWERTY fits at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature is the All Activity section that becomes available when you add both Facebook and Twitter accounts. It pulls status updates from both networks into a single list. You can also post a status update on both networks simultaneously from there. Unfortunately, there's no option to post only to one of the networks - you have to go to the network's specific section to do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Friend search also becomes available on both networks - it searches both accounts for a given name.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Same old Nokia Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian is rapidly losing its market share and that can't be good news for its application store, which even in the prime of the platform remained pretty barren compared to the iOS App Store and Android's Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company has refreshed their Nokia store interface to make it more user-friendly for Symbian^3 and it's what you get on Belle too. And while the UI is indeed very handy to use, the number of apps is somewhat of a letdown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default screen shows a list of featured apps or you can browse the apps available in the Nokia Store by categories (Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization) or by collections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps track of all the apps you have installed under My stuff. You can now also select where games and apps should be installed and where audio and video should go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps comes with free lifetime navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView comes with a built-in GPS receiver, which locked onto satellites in less than a minute upon a cold start (A-GPS turned off). Keeping the lock from then on was not an issue for the 808 PureView even in a dense urban environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best perks of buying a Nokia smartphone is that you get free voice-guided navigation for life (that's the phone's life, not yours). The voice guidance is currently available in over 70 countries and over 40 different languages, with even traffic information for more than 10 of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Nokia did a pretty decent job of the Nokia Maps application itself, giving it a cool, touch-friendly interface, as well as nice features such as location info from Lonely Planet or Qype (you get a different source for the different locations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Nokia Maps 3.09 you get three different view modes including satellite and terrain maps. Those however do need an internet connection. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand and can be used with preloaded maps. You can download maps directly on the phone, no computer needed anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Routes can be set to either fastest or shortest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map. Nokia Maps 3.09 also joins in on the location check-in craze and supports a long list of networks (but not Foursquare, understandably).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's missing is the "More" option we've seen on other installations of Nokia Maps 3.06 - it allowed you to enable extra features like a 5-day weather forecast and Map Reported, which can be used to report map inaccuracies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another perk is the Public Transport app which uses the GPS to show you the different means of public transportation near you (bus, subway, etc.). Currently, only big metropolitan areas are covered, but Nokia are assuring they are adding new locations every day.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView is getting a lot of attention - if nothing else, the Finns have sparked people's curiosity to unprecedented levels. This review is just the latest in a series of articles we've posted to try and cover every aspect of the most impressive cameraphone we've ever seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is of course the single most prominent feature of the 808 - both in terms of physical appearance and level of interest. It beats every other phone camera at still photography and the flexibility offered by the camcorder is unmatched. And don't forget the zoom - the loss-less digital zoom alone is enough of a reason to make this cameraphone a great buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In good light you can stand next to someone with a DSLR and keep your chin up. And with its xenon flash, the PureView comes out smiling even in most low-light scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Symbian experience is light years ahead of what it was on the 5800 XpressMusic. The OS has caught with to the competition with numerous UI and usability updates, and it's lightweight enough so even the 1.3GHz single-core processor of old architecture delivers a fast, fluid experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a couple of things to consider though. Symbian is good now, but users have already moved on and the developers followed (not that devs ever got too enthusiastic about the touch-enabled Symbian). Apps are the single most important feature of a smartphone ecosystem today and Symbian is lagging behind in that department with no chances to catch up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other issue is physical dimensions - the 808 PureView is very thick and quite heavy, probably more than what many people are willing to accept.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, back in the day, the Nokia N8 sold 4 million units in under a year, so it's not impossible for the 808 PureView to become one of the company's bestsellers, even with all those Lumias around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView is a unique device, one that has virtually no alternative. What we can do instead is list the phones people will probably end up buying after admiring the 808's camera, but deciding against it for reasons like comfort and practicality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Millions of people already own an Apple iPhone 4S or a Samsung Galaxy S III and their cameras are good enough for the casual consumer. Plus, those people will be unlikely to leave their comfy app ecosystems, where they've probably already spent a good amount of money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia S tries to bring back the old glory of the 12MP shooters. Though the jump from 8MP to 12MP seems tiny after seeing the PureView 38MP photos, it's still 50% more pixels. The Xperia ion is also an option with the same camera, but bigger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're in a part of the world where it's available, you might want to look at the HTC Titan II. It has double the megapixels with a 16MP camera, but Windows Phone 7.5 is in the same boat as Nokia Belle. Not to mention that the image quality isn't as good as the high resolution might make you believe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Apple iPhone 4S ? Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III ? Sony Xperia S ? HTC Titan II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a phone, the Nokia 808 PureView could be the swan song of a platform worth many glorious chapters in smartphone history. There may be still a few more Symbians to come, but who will remember them over this unique gadget?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a sign of things to come, the 808 PureView signals something brighter. PureView, combined with the purchase of Scalado's impressive camera technologies, point to a Nokia that will continue to dominate the phone photography field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Couple that with Nokia's knack for sturdy, well-designed hardware and the exciting Windows Phone 8, and the company suddenly looks a lot more likely to claw its way out of the slump.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 808 PureView will have a prominent place in the Nokia Hall of Fame. We're likely to see a ton of short films and music videos shot with the 808 (like we did with the N8), which will keep the phone in the public eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So hats off to the Finns - there are no two ways about it. With the Microsoft deal a gamble that's yet to pay off, with plenty of people unable to get over the way MeeGo was treated, with a market obsessed with software and apps, you'd think they'd have other things on their mind than developing what's probably the most revolutionary technology this industry has seen for quite some time. Madness? This is Nokia.</paragraph>
