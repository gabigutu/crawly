			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and the LG G5 both come outfitted with some great cameras, which should potentially bring low-light photography with a smartphone on the next level. We set out on foot on the streets of New York to put these two to the ultimate camera test - their image quality when it comes to shooting in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 edge makes use of large 1.4µm pixels with a really bright aperture of f/1.7 on top of the already excellent OIS which should help in low-light conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 has two camera sensors on the back, but for this particular comparison, we are not going to use the 8MP wide-angle camera on the G5. The LG G5's main camera is a 16MP sensor, which has a similarly wide f/1.8 aperture and OIS. LG also makes use of a laser focusing system for close subjects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other side, Samsung's Dual Pixel autofocus is lightning fast. Focusing happens so quickly that you might be able to get the best shot on the first attempt. This could be a leg up over LG's laser focus, but we'll have to check out the results before jumping to conclusions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should make note that the performance of the S7 edge in this comparison apply in full for the more compact Galaxy S7 as both models have identical cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are our favorite features of each of the two flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones are already available and even though the LG G5 is more of a match for the smaller Galaxy S7, it's actually priced somewhere in-between the S7 and the S7 edge so either for those two could be considered direct competitors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sunset stills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first set of samples was taken just before sunset, and even from these photos, we can sort of gauge how these phones are processing images to correct fuzziness or compensate for noise. For most scenes, we've taken one with HDR and another one without HDR to see how it affected them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've let both phones automatically decide how to set the correct exposure and focus, we have not tapped-to-zoom in any of these photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notice here, the sun is just setting at Central Park. The G5 was able to capture the scene with better exposure under normal settings, and was able to show more detail in the grass around the sewer grate; the Galaxy S7 overprocessed the fine detail in the image noticeably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR helped both phones to represent better the scene going on, especially because of the sun setting. The LG G5 however managed to resolve more fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second sunset scene was captured better by the LG G5, as it recognized the conditions better and focused on capturing the sunset rather than exposing the foreground as the Galaxy S7 edge did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning on the HDR allowed both phones to capture the greatness of the sunset equally well though the Galaxy S7 resolved more fine detail. Still, the LG G5 has gone after a more pleasing color balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We left Central Park and headed out to shoot some urban sceneries before nightfall. We liked those tall buildings for our first scene, so we took a few shots. The LG G5 chose to shoot at much lower ISO 50 setting and twice as low shutter speed (1/30 vs. 1/60), which helped it resolve more fine detail in both background and foreground. The colors and exposure were better on the LG G5, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we turned the HDR on, the LG G5 kept its advantage over the Galaxy S7 edge - thanks to the lower ISO and slower shutter speed it managed to do noticeably better. The Galaxy S7 edge has the sole advantage of the bigger vertical FoV for this particular scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the cameras towards the sidewalk was quite interesting. The Galaxy S7 edge failed to focus, and its non-HDR shot is quite soft while the LG G5 shined with impressive dynamic range, a great amount of fine detail, and accurate colors. Sure, there is some noise, but we suspect the lack of harsh noise reduction is one of the reasons for the better detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 edge greatly benefitted from the HDR setting, and it outed a very pleasing shot though the LG G5 kept its coolness and still did better with more detail and accurate colors. While both phones got out more detail in the shadows with HDR, the LG G5 used a higher ISO setting and produced a more pleasing, brighter image.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nightfall stills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Downtown is where this shootout intensified. We had a tripod, so we shot the first very demanding scene with both phones mounted on it. Once again the LG G5 liked to use a lower ISO 500 setting (against ISO 800), and its slower shutter speed (1/10 vs. 1/30) gave it the noticeable advantage. Both phones outed two great wallpaper-grade shots, but the LG G5's image has more detail, less noise, and better colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both handsets benefited from the HDR option and got more detail out of the shadows. The LG G5 image is noisier but brighter due its higher ISO 450 (vs. ISO 320). The shutter speed was the same on both phones - 1/10s. We think both images are on par, so it's up to you to decide whether you prefer brighter but noisier over darker but smoother.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the next scene we ditched the tripod, and yet both contenders outed the same results - nothing short of excellent. The LG G5 was brighter (ISO 800 vs. ISO 400) but noisier while the Galaxy S7 edge was a bit darker but smoother.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning on the HDR was a massive boost for both snappers though the LG G5 image has traces of motion blur. Tripod-free and HDR on the Galaxy S7 did better with very little noise and some impressive amount of detail. Its colors were more accurate and pleasing, and while its sample is once again darker (shot ISO 200 vs. ISO 350), it was the better shooter for the occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we called it a day, we snapped the final round between the LG G5 and the Galaxy S7 edge on our way to our restaurant table. Inside the premises, the Galaxy S7 edge came on top of the LG G5 by a mile. Its sample is far better with more detail, less noise, and while the colors are a bit more saturated, we like the result better.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Naturally, we shot a few low-light videos with both phones. The first batch of videos we captured in 4K and in 1080p resolution around the lake in Central Park, just after sunset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the 4K videos, the LG G5 demonstrated the higher dynamic range and overall better understanding of the scene. The Galaxy S7 edge, on the other hand, outed more pleasing colors though its image is much darker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both camcorders resolved an equal amount of detail, but the foliage on the Galaxy S7 edge looks better. Still, the LG G5 4K video is the one to win this particular setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching to 1080p resolution turned up to be a whole different scenario. While both phones did great in capturing fine detail and keeping the noise levels down to a minimum, the Galaxy S7 edge was way ahead of the LG G5 with higher dynamic range, color balance, and higher contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We used the tripod for the next scene, as we did for the still samples. Shooting at 4K downtown proved the Galaxy S7 edge to be noisier than the LG G5 while the colors and contrast were on par. Both phones did very well, but we prefer the clearer image of the G5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opting for 1080p video recording allowed the Galaxy S7 edge to shine again. Its 1080p video has more fine detail, less noise, higher dynamic range, better colors, and contrast. Apparently, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge records pretty amazing 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the LG G5 turned out to be the better 4K camcorder, even though only by a whisker on top of the Galaxy S7 edge. If you are after the better 1080 camcorder, then the Galaxy S7 edge is the master of this video mode, especially in low-light sceneries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a YouTube playlist with all eight videos we shot for this comparison.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Capturing low-light scenes with the LG G5 and the Galaxy S7 edge is a hassle-free task on both phones. They are well equipped with OIS and wide apertures to handle low-light scenery, and you can't go wrong with either of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the LG G5 has the advantage when capturing still images - it has a higher resolution sensor, with wider FoV. Throughout the scenes we shot, the G5 bettered the Galaxy S7 edge almost every time, even though not by much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching to 4K video recording, the LG G5 once again edged the Galaxy S7 edge (forgive us the pun!), which makes it the overall winner in this shootout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 edge has a significant advantage over the LG G5 at 1080p recording, capturing amazing videos unmatched by the G5 and it also offers a wider field of view in this mode. It often outed better colors than the G5 and is a lot more capable when shooting indoors where the light is really low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So with the 1080p videos and the indoor shot aside, the LG G5 consistently won over the Galaxy S7 edge, so if we are to pick a winner for this low-light shootout - it has got to be the G5, though not by a large margin. Once again, though, both phones are very well equipped to handle any low-light situation you may decide to shoot, so you won't be disappointed by either of them.</paragraph>
