			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With its international sibling receiving accolades left and right, it is time for the AT&amp;T exclusive, LTE sporting HTC One X to take the stage. While the newcomer has retained the gorgeous looks of the global version, it is yet another case of a character makeover, received prior to crossing the Atlantic. In order to get along with AT&amp;T's LTE network, the US residing HTC One X sports a Qualcomm chipset and CPU, rather than the NVIDIA silicon featured in the globally available smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X for AT&amp;T packs Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon S4 chipset, featuring two Krait CPU cores, clocked at 1.5GHz. While this is quite a sharp departure from the quad-core sporting Tegra 3 from NVIDIA, it is the only way to enjoy LTE on the smartphone at the moment. And besides, our previous encounter with the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4, packed in the HTC One S, clearly showed that, due to its brand new architecture, it stacks up quite well, and even outperforms the Tegra 3 silicon at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the full list of features, which the HTC One X for AT&amp;T has to offer, followed by some of its disadvantages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the spec sheet ticking almost all the boxes, only the pickiest of users will find something to complain about. The HTC One X for AT&amp;T is a proper Android powerhouse, ready to take on any competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone's weakest point will undoubtedly be the limited amount of built-in memory - it's non-expandable and 13 gigs worth of storage are not too likely to cut it for heavy users these days, considering the fact that graphic intensive video games easily hit the 700MB download mark. Not to mention the high-definition videos you might want to enjoy on that HD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, how much has the AT&amp;T flavored HTC One X changed during its trip across the pond? Read on to find out. As always, we'll kick things off with an unboxing, followed by a design and build quality inspection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this review is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The HTC One X for AT&amp;T is a US-only phone and it's unlikely it will be making rounds on the Old Continent. Still, we think we've captured the essence of the phone in the same precise, informative and detailed way that's become our trademark. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A stripped down retail package, typical for the US<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Inside the orange/white colored, AT&amp;T branded box, you will find a charger, a microUSB cable, some booklets, and a tiny key to use when removing the microSIM card tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Headset would have certainly been appreciated in the retail package, given the One X's Beats Audio capabilities. You will however, have to take care of this on your own. AT&amp;T stores will gladly help you out on this instance the moment you go to pick up a One X - the carrier does offer quite a few Beats Audio accessories.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The AT&amp;T version of the HTC One X is an exact copy of its Tegra 3 sporting relative. This means that the device is just as gorgeous - it is simply better looking than any Android smartphone currently on the market. The handset's polycarbonate unibody is arguably HTC's best design accomplishment yet -the One X looks unmistakably like and HTC smartphone, yet completely new and like nothing else we've seen come from the Taiwanese manufacturer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality is also superb. The polycarbonate construction of the HTC One X is certain to endure use and abuse much better than any of its current alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is available in two color schemes - matte black and white. You can't go wrong by picking either one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a smartphone with a massive 4.7" display on board, the HTC One X for AT&amp;T offers some pretty acceptable measures. They are 134.8 x 69.9 x 8.9 mm, while the handset's weight is a relatively skinny 129 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X display offers arguably the best image quality of any LCD on the market. Not only is it remarkably sharp (at about 312 ppi, it's virtually impossible to distinguish individual pixels), but also has great contrast and nicely saturated colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find out all about the display of the HTC One X for AT&amp;T, and its performance over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, we have the proximity and ambient light sensors to the left of the earpiece and the 720p video call camera on the right. There's a tiny status LED under the earpiece grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen, we find the three controls typical of Android 4.0 ICS which, in the HTC tradition, come in capacitive flavor. The haptic enabled Back, Home and Task switcher keys are well spaced and very responsive. We've been over this already - while ICS dictates on-screen controls, the latest Sense UI requires actual Back and Home buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the HTC One X features the microUSB port, which is used for data transfers, charging and, thanks to its MHL support, TV-out. With an MHL adapter you'll be able to output 1080p content to your HDTV directly from your phone, so purchasing one is probably worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side we find nothing but the super slim volume rocker. With all the fuss HTC made about the One X's camera, you would be forgiven for expecting to find a shutter key here, but there is no such thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the 3.5mm audio jack, a microphone pinhole (probably used for ambient noise cancellation in calls) and the Power/Lock key, which is easy enough to hit when needed but still reasonably secure against accidental presses. The microSIM slot is located nearby at the sloping part of the phone's rear body. You need to insert the SIM eject tool located in the retail box or a pin inside the hole next to the slot to access the microSIM tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone, you will see the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the HTC One X features the 8MP camera lens and the LED flash right next to it. The camera lens is placed on a bulge and the protective glass may get scratched by surfaces it comes in contact with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other elements at the back are the loudspeaker grille near the bottom and the Beats audio logo right above it. You should keep in mind though that the audio enhancements are only available when you have connected a pair of headphones and not when using the loudspeaker itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X for AT&amp;T achieved the rather impressive endurance rating score of 42. This means that the smartphone will go on for 42 hours on a single charge, should you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get the full scoop on the battery test of the One X for AT&amp;T over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the HTC One X for AT&amp;T is, unsurprisingly, a great experience. Just like its global relative, the phone is a joy to behold. If looks and feel are what you are after, you will be hard pressed to find a better alternative in the land of Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have rarely encountered a phone, whose design and build quality are as flawless as in the case of the HTC One X for AT&amp;T. The handset is a massive improvement over its predecessors - particularly in the looks department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following next is a look at the software of the Yankee One X and, very importantly, the performance of the dual-core CPU from Qualcomm.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sense 4.0 on top of Android 4.0 ICS just makes sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X for AT&amp;T comes with Android 4.0.3 and Sense 4.0 - both the latest and greatest Google and HTC have to offer. We've already seen those in action on the One S, but One X for AT&amp;T offers even smoother performance and higher resolution. There are no surprises though, nothing exclusive on the One X for AT&amp;T that is not present on the One S as well. Still we are going to explore the Android/Sense combo once again for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've already heard about the new screen - it's really awesome and the OS and the Sense UI look even better on its HD resolution than on the One S's qHD. The One X for AT&amp;T offers probably the best smartphone experience to date - both visual and functional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo video to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC are famous for their deep customizations of the interface of the host OS and the latest version of Sense is no exception, though the Taiwanese have taken user feedback to heart and worked hard to provide a much more unobtrusive experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brilliant lockscreen has been further improved, sealing its position as the most functional, most customizable lockscreen on a smartphone. By default, it has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, you can drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's not the end of it - the HTC One X for AT&amp;T comes with eight different lockscreens preinstalled. You can access the others from the Personalize menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get all the old ones - a photo album, Friend Stream, Weather, clock and stocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two new additions though and they're much more functional. The first is called Productivity and lists the latest missed calls, texts, emails and scheduled events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second one is People - you pick a group from your phonebook and a rectangular grid of their contact images will pop up on the lockscreen. Grab one of them and drop them on the ring to view their details. You can have more than one page of contacts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're using the music player, the playback controls show up on the lockscreen (as usual), and you can drag that onto the ring to jump straight into the music player too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you can't download new lockscreens off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have done a lot to streamline the lockscreen and the same goes for the homescreen. Gone is the scrolling indicator arc, gone is the three button dock that wasn't very useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get an auto-hiding indicator of which screen you're on and a brand new dock with five shortcuts - the middle one is locked to the app drawer, while the other four can be customized as you please (you can even put a folder there, if four shortcuts isn't enough).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leap view is still here - tap the home key (while on the default homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out (with an awesome animation) to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes. A small "home" icon indicates the default homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have as many as seven homescreens - and with all the excellent preloaded widgets, you might want to keep all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the biggest complaints was that the Personalize button was just taking up space in the dock at the bottom of the screen. And it was - it has since been moved to the app drawer, but it still offers plenty of customization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An access to the proprietary Scenes is one of them - essentially five custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, Play and default). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course, and you can download new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds, but they're a handy feature if you use your One X for AT&amp;T as both work and personal phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper each and use different colors for various UI elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, which is composed of horizontal pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetical, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There are Search and Play Store shortcuts along with a menu for some options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom - All apps, Frequent and Downloads. You can rearrange them or remove Frequent and Downloads if you don't need them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Personalize app also has Sound customizations - you can pick a Sound set or individual ringtone, notification and alarm sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding widgets to the homescreen is done in similar fashion to Honeycomb and is one of the less successful changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You press and hold on the homescreen and everything zooms out so that the homescreen panes are visible as thumbnails on the top row of the screen. You tap a homescreen to select it and then select a widget to add to it (or you can just drag the widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a search option to speed things along or you can choose a widget from the dropdown menu and then select which size you like, but that still feels like an extra step.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old setup of picking a widget and then picking the size (if any) seemed simpler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different from vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the top of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it on the screen again to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second "button" is Remove, which deletes the widget as expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area no longer has the list of recent apps - it's all available to notifications only. No more tabs and toggles either - you get a Settings shortcut here if you need to power something on or off. There's also a Clear button to dismiss all notification or you can swipe them off one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have remodeled the app switching interface - screenshots are displayed of the running apps, turned slightly to the side. They're ordered horizontally (instead of vertically as is the ICS standard) and you can swipe up to remove them. The not so-good news is that you can only see three of them at a time, even in landscape mode - a waste of screen estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the old task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you already read our HTC One S review, you already know what to expect here. The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 in the HTC One X for AT&amp;T is just as solid a performer. Due to its newer architecture, it outclasses the Tegra 3 chipset of the global version on more than one occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Benchmark Pi result of the One X for AT&amp;T is the best we've seen to date. Linpack tested in multi-threaded mode on the other hand, showed that two Krait cores outdo the Tegra 3 quartet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D graphics department is handled by Qualcomm's Adreno 225 GPU. Unsurprisingly, the One X for AT&amp;T posted a score which was in line with its Snapdragon packing relative - the One S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On SunSpider, the CPU-stressing JavaScript benchmark, the HTC One X for AT&amp;T posted a slightly slower result than the Tegra 3 sporting global version. The same goes for the Browsermark test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X for AT&amp;T is certainly one of fastest phones currently on the market - there's no test in the mobile world it can't pass with flying colors. The Snapdragon S4 equipped version also clearly shows that there's more to performance than just the sheer number of CPU cores.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great social phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The One X for AT&amp;T has HTC's all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it's juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed - you have the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account. If an account features multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and the fourth one called "Gallery" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transfer app is here to help you switch from your old phone. It supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth. It's an old, but useful trick.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X for AT&amp;T had no problems with reception and the in-call quality was clear and loud enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the One X for AT&amp;T displays your recent calls and the list of favorite contacts underneath. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X for AT&amp;T packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, "Quiet ring on pickup" will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android OS, and the HTC One X for AT&amp;T in particular, is capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's Gtalk, which can connect you to Google's chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered - the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. "drx" matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose box stretches across only about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or across about a third in landscape. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on the One X for AT&amp;T boils down to an on-screen custom-made HTC virtual QWERTY keyboard. While it's still not as good as a hardware one, it's the next best thing - the 4.7" screen has enough real estate for big, well-spaced keys, which are thumb-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two email clients<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X for AT&amp;T comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color-coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs, but they are hidden by default. You can choose Edit tabs from the menu and pull out the ones you want. You can choose from Favorites, Unread, Marked, Invites and Attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC One X for AT&amp;T lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery for both offline and online images<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X uses the in-house HTC gallery - a custom app, which stacks photos much like the vanilla Android gallery (it used to display a list of thumbnails). The app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. You can choose to show/hide camera shots, All photos or All videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the Albums dropdown lets you view local albums, albums on a network (DLNA) device or online albums. On the cloud side, you get Facebook, Flickr, Dropbox, Picasa or SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ones you pick one of the "stacks" (each standing for a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. Some photos have an icon indicating it's not a single photo but a burst shot instead. You can later go back and pick the keep or the one to be used as a thumbnail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but you can't copy/paste images across folders - you'd need a proper file manager for that. There are some basic editing tools - crop, rotate and effects (auto enhance, sepia, vintage, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too. Another thing we admire about the HTC gallery is that it displays photos in full resolution, which we believe is a must on a 720p display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the HTC One X is built into the Gallery app - there's no dedicated shortcut inside the app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC One X is a huge step forward, compared to what the Sensation XE offered. It comes with a view mode toggle (full screen or best fit) and you can scrub through videos. There's a shortcut that lets you adjust screen brightness and another one to take screenshots of videos. Overall the included options are more than enough and they are all implemented in a nice out-of-the-way manner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X played most files we threw at it - AVI, MP4, MKV - though it did choke on some old XviD AVI videos. Codec support on the video side is excellent - all popular video codecs run at up to 1080p resolution easily. Sound is more problematic and AAC or DTS wouldn't play (that's true for most other phones though, One S included).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of audio, you can choose between Beats Audio, HTC enhancer or No effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitle support is available, though you can't manually pick a subtitle file, so you have to name it the same as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes handy too - the One X can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the MHL port too - if you have the proper adapter, you can hook up your HDTV using an HDMI cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and Beats for all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music app starts off by offering you several shortcuts - music library on the phone, SoundHound track recognition, TuneIn Radio or 7digital. Below is a line that shows a recently played song and further down is the currently playing song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the music library available on the phone you get a dropdown menu to browse it by artist, album, playlist or genre. There's a search tool too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist - you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap the ellipsis to automatically fetch album art for a track or look it up on Google or YouTube. From the Menu you get a Select player option, which is how you can play the song on a DLNA-enabled sound system or over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X has the Beats Audio moniker stamped on the back, which means your sound is enhanced to boost the sonic experience - you can use it with any headset you want. You can choose between multiple presets - Beats audio, classical, bass boost and so on. HTC finally allow you to turn the effects completely off, which is great news for those of us who are not that bass oriented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the phone doesn't come with a Beats headset it supports several of them - iBeats/urBeats, Beats Solo, Beats Pro or Beats Studio. You should pick the correct one as it adjusts the equalizer according to the characteristics of the headset. There's an "Other" option too, but if you're not using Beats you can just pick the one that sounds best to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen shows the album art and name of the song and artist along with playback controls. You can drag this card into the ring to unlock the phone and go straight to the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and they've even integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio remains unchanged<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback, which was rather weak on the One X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the headphones or loudspeaker choice you also get Mono sound if the reception is poor. There's no Beats enhancement here though or a playback control card on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have a data connection, you can use 7digital or TuneIn radio instead of relying on your local FM radio stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera does well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels and records 1080p video @ 30fps. There's an LED flash / video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the same for both the still camera and the video camera - no they don't "look alike", the camera just has the UI shared between both functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side features the Effects button, shutter key, camcorder record key and a shortcut to the gallery that shows the last photo taken. On the left is the flash setting toggle, general settings and shot mode (we'll get back to that in a moment).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To snap a photo, you tap the shutter key. To record video you tap the button below - and you can still tap the shutter key to snap a full-res photo, even while recording video. Another cool option is the burst mode, which we mentioned in the gallery - you press and hold on the shutter key and it will snap multiple photos and let you pick which one to keep (you can keep all of them of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a tab on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on). There's also some other cool effects such as shallow depth of field , which lets you blur parts of a photo that fall outside a predefined circular area. It's like having Instagram built right into the camera app UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is pretty cool, but we had one problem with this combined interface - if you want full 8MP resolution still shots, you have to disable the Widescreen option. But then it becomes hard to frame a 16:9 video in the 4:3 view finder. That's made even worse when shooting 720p video. The field of view in that mode is narrower than what the viewfinder shows and framing involves a lot of guesswork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X has touch focus and face detection; geotagging and smile shutter are also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is available too which is good to have on a phone like the One X with no hardware shutter key (the virtual shutter key cannot trigger autofocus either, it does burst mode). On the downside, the continuous autofocus may be way off in some shots - the only way to be certain you have it right is to tap and hold on the spot of the screen where you want the focus to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shot mode button offers some more cool stuff - HDR photos, Panorama (with a gyro horizon), portrait, group portrait, landscape, whiteboard, close-up and, finally, low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Group portrait is quite cool - we've seen something like it before in the Scalado Rewind. It snaps multiple photos and for each face (and the One X can track many faces), the phone automatically picks the one where that person is smiling and didn't blink and then combines them all on one single photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC didn't take any chances with the camera this time - an f/2.0 aperture and a dedicated image processing chip clearly show they mean business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extra thought that went into the One X camera has certainly paid off. It ranks among the better 8 MP sharpshooters out there. Detail is very good and noise is kept under control most of the time. Colors are nice without being exaggerated. The available dynamic range is quite alright too. The only issue is that the noise reduction algorithm is a tad too overeager at times, resulting in smeared detail in shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a bunch of samples for you guys below, check them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC are bragging about the instant photo capture during video recording and we decided to give it a spin. The photos are taken in 16:9 aspect ratio and are in 3264 x 1840 resolution. The idea is that you can snap fast-paced pics while you're recording a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results came out really nice with good detail and motion blur is kept in check. Here are the samples.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The One X records 1080p or 720p videos at 30fps and it can snap photos while at it. You can also use touch focus and even toggle the video light - that's during recording!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in MP4 files and use H.264 encoding. 1080p videos have a somewhat low bitrate of about 10Mbps, but manage to retain very good levels of detail. The colors are oversaturated though, unlike in the stills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One X camera boasts stereo audio recording with a sampling rate of 44kHz and bitrate of 128Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p videos captured by the HTC Once X are good. They only use half the bitrate (makes sense since 720p is about half as many pixels as 1080p). You should keep in mind their field of view is narrower than the 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched sample 720p@30fps video clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a video uploaded to YouTube for convenience. Don't forget to click 1080p on the FullHD video sample and open the video on full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also prepped a 720p video sample taken with the One X.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Worry-free connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X packs quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band 3G with HSDPA speeds up to 21Mbps and HSUPA up to 5.76Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LTE is undoubtedly the most important connectivity feature of the HTC One X. With the network being new and having a fairly small number of devices running on it, the speeds which we encountered in the New York City area were truly amazing. Just beware of the phone's battery life and AT&amp;T's tiered data plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n and full DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already said the death grip problem haunting HTC devices of old is now taken care of and there's nothing to worry about. Wi-Fi reception is strong, as is the cell signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the One X with a PC. The long list of options includes PC Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (the phone becomes a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computer's Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive have large, easy-to-press icons, which comes in handy since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X comes with an MHL port, so if you plug a MHL dongle in, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection. The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV and with the HD resolution of the display, watching on an HDTV is a joyful experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pretty decent ICS Browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One X comes with the latest version of the Android web browser. Coupled with the HD display and powerful processing power of the One X, the stock ICS web browser performs without hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of its UI is out of sight, leaving the entire screen to the web page. And even when it does appear, it consists of a single bar, which holds a back button, a Read button and the standard Menu dropdown on the right. The Read key aims to show some text-heavy web pages in a distraction-free mode to facilitate reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has also thrown in some extra buttons at the bottom of the screen, which seemed to pop up randomly, which was getting a bit annoying at times. You see sometime those buttons appeared along with the top bar, whereas on other occasions they remained hidden when the top bar was showing. Those mysteriously behaving buttons let you save a page in your bookmarks or reading list, view bookmarks, saved pages or tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might also want to enable Quick controls - they let you tap on any point on the edge of the screen and move your finger to select the desired option from a jog-dial menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner - they can't be swiped off the screen like you do in the app switcher. Incognito tabs are available if you want to browse without leaving traces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Menu options include a toggle to enable/disable Flash and another one to request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another ICS feature has the phone preload search results that it believes are relevant, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the HTC One X has full Flash support and playing Flash videos was a walk in the park. Flash games work like a charm as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X for AT&amp;T features the usual set of organizer applications, to go with a mobile office app, capable of both viewing and editing documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word, Excel documents and presentations. There is also a PDF viewer preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation view only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), only one of which you can sync with your computer. You can also easily show/hide the ones you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator on board. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock (also part of the Clock app) is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and zoom in on it freely. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. You also get a stopwatch and a timer in the same app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. You can use the Stocks lockscreen too. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo's weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an HTC-branded flashlight app too - it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Store and HTC Hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of wallpapers and sound customizations - ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and HTC Locations show your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X also comes with HTC Locations, an app developed in cooperation with TomTom (software provider) and Route66 (providing the maps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HTC Locations you can download country maps for free, or just cache maps as you browse (the size of the cache is adjustable). Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can even calculate new routes offline, while the Google Maps app only offers rerouting without internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will do voice-guided navigation too, but you'll need a license for that. The One X comes with a trial version worth 30 days of free worldwide navigation. A license for Western Europe will set you back a hefty &#x20ac;40 for a life-time license, the US is $30. Annual and monthly subscriptions are available too. You can also get traffic information and speed camera alerts (&#x20ac;10 for a year for Western Europe, for example). Extra voices are free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better look of what's ahead. It's just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode - at first it seems choppy, but that's only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world). You could use two fingers to rotate the camera manually too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The AT&amp;T version of the HTC One X has plenty going for it. The smartphone is just as beautiful and well put together as its global sibling, yet still manages to outperform it on almost every occasion. Comparisons aside, the Sense UI 4.0 offers top-notch user experience and the camera is a joy to use with its simple interface and a slew of available features. Feature-wise, one could barely ask for more than the AT&amp;T exclusive smartphone can already offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Out biggest complaint about the AT&amp;T HTC One X is the extremely limited built-in storage capacity of the smartphone. With only 13GB of available memory, quite a few users might find themselves being overly careful about the number of apps they install, or amount of multimedia they have on the One X. The limited storage may have worked fine for Apple and the iPhone, but Android users are a different crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 25GB of free Dropbox storage are not a complete solution to the abovementioned problem. After all, you still need to download the files before opening them on your One X. Not to mention that you might need to use you data plan for the exercise too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X for AT&amp;T is priced extremely competitively at $199.99 with a two-year contract. Currently, the smartphone is easily the most capable Android device offered by AT&amp;T ? a status which will be maintained at least until the arrival of the Samsung Galaxy S III. In case you are not necessarily sold on using AT&amp;T, here are some other options for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 4G LTE from Sprint Wireless should definitely be on anybody?s ber-smartphone shortlist. The LTE rocking smartphone packs identical hardware to the One X for AT&amp;T, but adds a microSD card slot and a superb dedicated camera button. The latest EVO will cost as much as the One X when launched in two days time, and is arguably the most complete Android smartphone on the U.S. market. We?ll tell you all about it in a few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Evo 4G LTE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If 4.7? is too much screen for you, take a look at the HTC One S for T-Mobile or HTC DROID Incredible 4G LTE for Verizon Wireless. The One S is quite similar to the One X for AT&amp;T, but packs a smaller AMOLED screen with qHD resolution. The latest Droid Incredible on the other hand is even more compact with a 4? S-LCD display. Both devices are solid alternatives to the One X, which should appeal to people with a knack for pocketability. They are also priced at $199.99 and, we promise, HTC won?t mind if you choose either one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC One S ? HTC DROID Incredible 4G LTE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All other smartphone alternatives currently on the market use older gen hardware and they are hard to recommend as they retail for about the same price. HTC have been clever to bring their big guns to the shelves before everyone else. Should you opt for a different manufacturer at the moment, you will need to settle for last year?s hardware (and quite possibly, software). With plenty of people out there who buy a phone mainly for its looks, the HTC One X for AT&amp;T is certain to develop a serious following. Thankfully, looks are not everything the HTC flagship has to offer. The smartphone is simply one of the most capable handsets available at the moment.</paragraph>
