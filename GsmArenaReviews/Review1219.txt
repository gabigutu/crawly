			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei have been flexing their mobile manufacturing muscle lately and one of their latest creations, the 7" MediaPad Android tablet, is getting its high-res screen and aluminum unibody ready to take on the big boys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad skimps on almost no ingredient in a bid to challenge the best 7" tablets out there. Sure, it would have been great to have Android ICS out of the box, but the screen has WXGA resolution and 216ppi pixel density - almost as high as the 10.1" Asus Transformer Prime TF700T and its 224ppi 1920x1200 screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not impressed yet? How about an aluminum unibody that's thinner and lighter than the plasticy Kindle Fire? What about some of these specs:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Pad is certainly dressed to impress, but the name Huawei just doesn't have a premium ring to it. However, with the super-thin Huawei Ascend P1 S and now the MediaPad, Huawei is sending a clear message that they can successfully compete in the high end too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad shows no lack of ambition in Huawei. But how good were they at taking it from the blueprints to a finished product? Jump to the next page where we begin to find out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad has a simple styling and feels rock solid though by no means heavy. The aluminum case folds around the screen and its square edges provide a very secure grip. Two patches of plastic at the back break the aluminum surface and match the black screen bezel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go on, we should note that the aluminum grey and black color combo we got is only one of several versions on offer. The alternatives are Shadow Black, Classic Brown, and Passion Pink. These versions have both the aluminum and the plastic bits painted in the chosen color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're only so many ways to design a tablet but the MediaPad does well to set itself apart. The black plastic triangles at the back give it a distinct enough look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad has an impressive screen as we mentioned already. With WXGA resolution (1280x800), the screen has more pixels than the majority of 7" tablets in the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel density works out to 216ppi which, as we already mentioned, is about as much as you get out of a 10.1" 1920x1200 tablet screen (like the Transformer Prime TF700T).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an IPS LCD too, which really helps it with viewing angles. There's practically no color or contrast loss at an angle. Sunlight legibility is good too, at 100% brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the Huawei MediaPad has about 400 nits of brightness, which is the norm for tablets. The black levels are more impressive than on most tablets and as a result, the contrast ratio is very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one complaint we have about the screen is the lack of specialty glass scratch protection. To be fair, many tablets miss that feature. Nothing that a screen protector can't fix, perhaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the screen itself, the only other items of interest on the front are the ambient light sensor and the 1.3MP front-facing camera. There's no earpiece, but talking on the MediaPad would look silly anyway. You can use the loudspeaker or a Bluetooth headset to do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's go around the sides of the tablet. The bottom short side is home to a 3mm charger plug, a microUSB port (non-charging, but has On-The-Go functionality) and the standard microHDMI port. The tablet's sole microphone is here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side features a 3.5mm audio jack and the stereo loudspeakers. It would have been better if the two speakers were on opposite sides. Also, if you hold the tablet horizontally, it's pretty easy to cover one of them with your palm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Huawei MediaPad holds the Power/Lock key and the volume rocker. The left side is left empty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time to flip the tablet over and inspect its back. The two distinctive black triangles are made of soft, matte plastic. The 5MP auto-focus camera is placed in the top one, while the bottom one is actually a removable cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pop it open (it can be a bit hard at first) to reveal the microSD and SIM card slots. The battery is not user accessible, but that's the norm for tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 4100mAh Li-Po battery powers the Huawei MediaPad. The official quote is 6 hours, but we ran our own tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In standby mode, the battery can last up to 10 days. But that's only if you don't touch the tablet - if you decide to do something fun with it, you can watch 6 hours of video straight. For web browsing, the MediaPad is good for 4 hours and 20 minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad is made of top-notch materials that give it a real premium feel. It feels very solid in the hand thanks to its unibody design. While it's not the thinnest or the lightest (it's still thinner and lighter than most 7-inchers), the MediaPad doesn't feel a burden at all. For the record, it measures 190 x 124 x 10.5 mm and weighs 390g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's compact enough that you can easily carry it in the pocket of a coat or jacket. This means that you can take it everywhere you go pretty easily, unlike 10" tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware of the Huawei MediaPad left a very positive impression on us. Let's find if the software can do the same and if the Snapdragon chipset benchmarks well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Untouched Honeycomb interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad runs Android 3.2 Honeycomb free of any modifications. We're not complaining about the lack of intervention on Huawei's part. Many prefer the vanilla interface and a third party launcher isn't hard to obtain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we begin here is a video demo of the user interface in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Honeycomb interface was designed specifically for tablets and it served as the basis for Ice Cream Sandwich. The navigation keys are in the bottom left corner of the homescreen: Back, Home and Tasks. The search shortcut is on the top left, the app drawer on the top right and finally, but certainly not least importantly, the notification area is in the lower right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has several toggles - Airplane mode, Wi-Fi, Auto-rotate screen Notifications, Sound and Brightness. An SRS shortcut is available here too - tapping it allows you to modify the global sound enhancement settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three always visible virtual keys- back, home and task switcher - are a part of Honeycomb and share the bottom status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's another way to place shortcuts on the homescreen - you press and hold on an empty area of any homescreen and you'll get a tabbed interface to select app shortcuts, widgets, wallpapers and other items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search shortcuts (voice and text) are in the top left corner of the homescreen, while the app launcher and homescreen edit buttons stay in the top right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher has two tabs - All and My apps. The first shows all available apps (duh), while the second one shows only non-native apps, making the apps that you installed easier to locate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shortcuts in the launcher are placed in side-scrollable pages. A tap and hold on a shortcut reveals several options - Uninstall, Info and the thumbnails of the 5 homescreens so you can drop the app on any one of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool thing about the task switcher is that it has grown tabs too. The first tab - Recent - shows you apps just like you're used to. The second tab is called Running and as the name suggests list only currently active apps that you can force close.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad packs two Scorpion cores running at 1.2GHz with 1GB of RAM at their disposal and there's an Adreno 220 GPU. Let's see how that combo compares to some of the other tablets we've tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi shows that the MediaPad is the slowest of the bunch, while Linpack has it neck and neck with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus. Performance depends on the workload we suppose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad has more pixels on its screen than the Tab 7.0 Plus and exactly as many as the Samsung Galaxy Note. Here the Adreno 220 matches the Mali-400MP that the two Samsung devices use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser benchmarks have the MediaPad trailing the performance of Tab 7.0 Plus, but ahead of a Gingerbread Note. When the Ice Cream Sandwich update hits, the performance will increase significantly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Widescreen phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is fairly straightforward on the Huawei MediaPad. The larger screen has allowed some modifications that reduce the number of clicks needed for some tasks by showing more info at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get your contacts listed by either first or last name in the left part of the screen, while the details of the currently selected contact appear on the right. There is a handy search field in the top right corner as well as a shortcut for adding a new contact or deleting the selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced menu offers more options: edit, import/export, or join contacts, send or print namecards, get friends via social services, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a single contact is done via a popup window, where the available fields are organized in groups, with plus and minus signs on the right that let you remove or repeat details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an Add another field button at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom field names aren't available at this stage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Voice calls on a tablet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad has great reception. As we mentioned in the hardware chapter, there's no earpiece on the tablet and while you can use the loudspeaker for calls, you'd probably be better off with a Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once in a call, the screen will lock after a few seconds. There's no proximity sensor to lock it automatically (again, you're not supposed to hold it up to your ear).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that our MediaPad came with no dialer app out of the box. A bit of Googling revealed that a small, bootleg APK can enable that but the dialer works only in landscape and looks like it came out of Android 1.5 Cupcake. You can grab the file from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it is possible to make voice calls and send/receive SMS messages with the Huawei MediaPad, even if the experience isn't very polished (there's no smart dialing, for example). You can try one of the many third-party dialers if you don't like this one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad came out of our loudspeaker test with a Good mark. It can be quite loud depending on the ringtone you use. You can find more about the test itself here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You get messaging too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's SMS and MMS available on the Huawei MediaPad to complement the voice call support. The experience is much like what you get on a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages with the same contact are organized into threads, you have options to manage these threads and even individual messages in them (lock to prevent accidental deletion, forwarding, copying the message contents, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily attach multimedia files to your message (or capture new ones on the spot) to turn it into an MMS, plus there's a full blown editor that you can use for multi-slide MMS messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email excellence<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad comes with both a generic Email app and Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email app has a split-screen interface and, initially, your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single email the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bulk actions are supported too, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get heavy traffic. You can sign into multiple accounts and you get a combined inbox too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set up the automatic email retrieval interval or you can disable that completely and check mail manually. There's also a handy setting that makes your client automatically download attachments only when you are connected over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app offers a lot of these same features (no combined inbox though) but packs some extra punch with the trademark conversation style view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing emails is quite comfortable with the virtual QWERTY keyboard occupying about half of the screen. Using it in landscape mode might be a bit of a stretch, but in portrait mode it's just right for typing with both your thumbs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's auto correction and auto capitalization available and you can enable sounds on key presses, but there's no haptic feedback.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sweet Honeycomb gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad gallery is a pretty standard Android affair in terms of looks and functionality. Naturally, your Picasa web albums are automatically synced with your tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort your images by album, date, location or tag. You can also choose between displaying images, videos or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper right corner holds the sorting options, shortcuts to the camera, image details or extra settings (like making Picasa albums available offline).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single image, there's a row of thumbnails at the bottom of the screen that can be used to easily jump to other photos in the collection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad gallery shows the images in full resolution so you can see the finest available detail in your images. If you want to zoom precisely to 100% just use the double tap gesture. You can zoom in even further - up to 200%, if you feel like it, though we can't quite see why one would need to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a cool accelerometer-based trick in the default view - albums with more than one photo inside have a cool 3D tower effect when you tilt the slate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player needs work<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad comes with an outdated-looking Music app. It sorts your audio collection by artist, album, songs or playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You don't get a lot of options with this player. There is, however, SRS sound enhancement available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers Movie mode (with no options), Music mode (with several presets, including SRS WOW HD) and a custom setting (with sliders for Bass and Treble). It's a global setting that you'll have to change manually when moving between the video player and the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if there is a track playing a shortcut appears in the notification area that will show a popup with the track info when tapped (but there are no player controls on it).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player with extensive codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android doesn't really have a dedicated video player interface, so the Video Player shortcut on the Huawei MediaPad just opens the Gallery and sets it to list videos only (which works quite well, actually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad supports MP4/DivX/XviD/MKV files out of the box. Performance with higher-res videos is great - it played ALL videos up to and including 1080p like a champ. They played smoothly for the most part, but for minor lags in some videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can watch 720p videos at 100% on the MediaPad's screen (there's a strip at the bottom reserved for status area and Android buttons). Through the microHDMI port you can output FullHD videos to an HDTV too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget that you can set SRS to Movie mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wish there were a bit more options though - like subtitle or choosing how to fit the video on the screen (crop to fit the screen, letterbox it, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player does have one nice feature - when you leave the player halfway through a video and try to play that video again later on, the player will ask you if you want to resume from the last watched scene or start over.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is quiet but impressively clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad put up a great performance in our audio quality test. The slate wasn't the loudest we have seen, but it managed to impress us with super clean output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the scores below, the MediaPad gets excellent scores on every part of the no-headphones test. Its sub-par volume levels are the only thing you can hold against it, but the overall performance is still great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's even more impressive is that very little goes wrong with headphones too. Some hardly detectable intermodulation distortion comes up and the stereo crosstalk goes up about as much as on most other devices. A very solid performance indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Disappointing 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad comes with a 5MP auto-focus camera, beating most other 7" tablets. It has a fixed-focus 1.3MP front-facing camera too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is very generous with the padding around its controls - a good thing, considering holding a tablet to take the shot is not very comfortable and tiny, cramped controls would have made it even worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the controls are packed in the right side of the screen. You get white balance effects and settings, with the virtual shutter centered between those. Then there are zoom controls on top along with a front/back and still/video camera toggles. A thumbnail of the last photo taken is placed on the viewfinder and obscures the lower left part of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality is very disappointing - there's plenty of color noise and the photos looked washed out (low contrast, bland colors). The MediaPad is pretty bad in the camera department, even for a tablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the simple black-on-white chart, the MediaPad didn't do all that bad, but there's a hint of a pink spot. In the second chart, you can see how much the ineffective noise reduction takes away from the gravel and grass patches. The final chart shows decent detail but also a bluish tint under artificial lighting.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent HD videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is not much different, really. It does have a Time lapse option, which can be used to create some interesting videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p videos suffer from much less noise than the stills. Contrast is better, without oversaturating the colors. There's not a whole lot of fine detail in the videos, but they are smooth (recorded at 24-25fps) and are actually usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound that goes with the videos is mono, recorded at 100Kbps bitrate and 16kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p sample that we captured with the Huawei MediaPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a 720p video sample from the slate that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera shoots 720p videos too, but as you can see from the sample below, they are 720p in name only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad shoots 720p videos. As the synthetic resolution chart shows, resolved detail in the videos is nothing spectacular. Up close and with good light, videos do look good enough to use. In low light, however, the framerate drops noticeably (as does the amount of detail).</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity gets the thumbs up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad has a full set of connectivity options. You get quad-band GSM plus tri-band 3G speeds of up to 14.4 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA. Those connections can be used for data and for calls/texts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support includes b/g/n and hotspot internet sharing. There's Bluetooth 2.1 too (no fancy stuff like Bluetooth 3.0 or Wi-Fi direct though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microSD card slot as well to expand the built-in memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad supports USB-on-the-go, but you will need to buy the right cable for that. The other wired port - microHDMI - makes playing 1080p videos on an HDTV a cinch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Desktop-like browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser is another key app as far as tablets are concerned. There is full Flash 11 support and tabbed browsing. The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field a la Chrome. This bar hides when you scroll down, but the tabs remain visible (along with a small down arrow that brings the address bar back out).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature borrowed from Chrome is Incognito Mode. This means you can browse without worrying about leaving traces in the history or data in the form auto-fill feature (so you can borrow the tablet and browse without worrying about exposing your login info).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks and History have their own screen with a split-screen interface. In History you can check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week. There're also Most Visited and Today tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A neat feature allows you to access quick page controls (back, forward, refresh, bookmark etc.) by a swiping gesture performed near the right edge of the screen. You cannot have that and the classical interface though so you have to pick your priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first, we had big problems with Flash performance. Luckily, it turned out that the fault lies with the pre-installed Flash plugin. We installed the official Flash Player 11 and 720p videos worked without a hitch (but 1080p wouldn't play) and so did Flash games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, if you're having Flash issues on the Huawei MediaPad, you should head straight to the Market and install the official Flash Player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and capable doc editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A good set of organizer apps are available on the Huawei MediaPad, including the Yozo Office that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool thing that Yozo does is when you try to create a new document - it will present you with several templates (for example, Blank, Letter, Balance sheet, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor itself is fully featured - it has extensive text styling options, it will create tables (a commonly missing feature in such editors) and even let you pick several bullet styles for lists and so on. There's a function editor for Excel docs too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is pretty impressive, but performance could have been better - panning and zooming is very laggy, even in simple docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Foxit Reader available for viewing PDF files. Performance here is much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you think of organizer features on a smartphone (or tablet) the first app that comes to mind is the calendar. It has five different types of view: daily, weekly and monthly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder. It can easily handle multiple online calendars too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator app is nicely touch optimized with huge, easy to hit buttons. Unlike the phone version of the app, this one makes use of the full screen by making the advanced functions always visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad also comes with a very basic clock app. It displays the current time full screen and has a shortcut for setting alarms. Alarms can individually be toggled on and off and can have custom repeat patterns, ringtones and notes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Useful apps on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad comes with the Aldiko eBook reader pre-installed and one free book on its virtual shelf - White Fang. You can easily purchase more books from the Store (there are free ones too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eBook reader allows you to highlight text and lets you search the book for occurrences or look up a word in the dictionary. You can switch between day and night mode, adjust the brightness, change the font and margin size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a File Manager app pre-installed that is quite capable - it can do mass move/copy/delete and search for files too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One perk that comes for free with the MediaPad is Cloud+. You're supposed to get 160GB of online storage (instead of the usual 16GB that the service offers). At least that's what the app says at launch. You can sync contacts, store and share files, backup your data and even locate your tablet, lock it and erase its data remotely if it gets lost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some reason, however, when we signed up, we only received 5GB of storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad comes with a powerful backup app out of the box. It can do backup and restore for files and apps, it can schedule backups and send files to the Cloud+ storage, where data will be safe even if something happens to the tablet and memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our MediaPad also came with several games pre-installed - the well-known Angry Birds, Asphalt 6 and Lets Golf 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and limited navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad comes with a GPS receiver, which got a satellite lock in under a minute with A-GPS turned off. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. We gotta say, we didn't experience any issues with the GPS chip performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad comes with Google Maps with Navigation to get you started. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and way easier on your data plan and the Navigation itself is becoming available in more and more countries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a screen as large (or larger) than most dedicated SatNav units any money spent towards satellite navigation should go to buying a good app rather than a separate SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab an alternative app from the Android Market - there are both free and paid ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 1.2GHz dual-core CPU and a high-res screen, the Huawei MediaPad should have no issues running new apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android market is the fastest growing app repository around (also the one with the most free apps and number of downloads), so you can be sure there's no shortage of software to install on your MediaPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>True, some apps aren't designed to work on a WXGA screen, but most scale well, so the only thing you have to worry about is finding enough time to enjoy all those apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market makes it easy to find cool new apps through its Featured apps, Editors' picks and Staff-recommended categories, in addition to the usual top free and top paid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top new paid and top new free lists are worth checking out too and you shouldn't forget the trending apps. Naturally, there is a built-in search and categories for the different types of apps so you don't get lost. Recommendations are also based on your location to make it even easier to spot a quality app in the new Android market.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Good looking and portable, the Huawei MediaPad offers the kind of all-round experience that even some of the big players on the field would find hard to match. With some aggressive pricing, the MediaPad will be an easily justifiable purchase.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We loved the build quality and the tablet seemingly packs all the features you can wish for - a high-res screen, microHDMI pot and plenty of processing power encased in an aluminum unibody.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, the camera could have been better (and that's putting it lightly), but we were never big fans of tablet photography anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real problem is that the market for 7" Android tablet is currently ruled by $200-$250 slates. The MediaPad is hands-down better than most of those, but people are looking to spend as little as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the discounted tablets are driving the average price down, so the MediaPad is in for some stiff competition. Let's check out some alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung P6200 Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus is very close specs-wise and has dropped quite a bit in price. Its screen has lower resolution, it's plastic-built rather than aluminum and the MHL port requires adapters, but there's more storage out of the box and it's a bit thinner and lighter. It also has voice call support like the MediaPad, a rare thing in tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 has similar specs and will launch with Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box and shoots 1080p video, but has a slower processor.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Acer Iconia Tab A100 and the Toshiba Thrive 7 are affordable ways to get a dual-core tablet with an HDMI port that runs Honeycomb and later, Ice Cream Sandwich. On the downside, they both lack GSM voice or data capability, the Tegra 2 chipset won't win any races and they are a bit on the chubby side.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>There's the Amazon Kindle Fire too - the 7" tablet many people are talking about. Yes, it's the cheapest brand name, with a dual-core processor and some nice perks, but it's not an Android tablet, not really. You can put proper Android on it, but no camera, no Bluetooth and no GPS mean that the Fire is very limited compared to the MediaPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Barnes &amp; Noble Nook Tablet is the Fire's sworn enemy - it offers proper Android and expandable memory (via microSD), but has cut down hardware too (things like GPS, Bluetooth and camera are nowhere to be found).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As an alternative, you can look at a BlackBerry PlayBook 4G - after the OS 2.0 update, it will support Android apps, plus it packs a 5MP camera with 1080p video capture, a microHDMI port and some BlackBerry magic.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>That's some heavy competition, especially with consumers preferring cheap tablets. But it's hard to beat the Huawei MediaPad on quality - you're getting some of the best hardware on the market right now (until the quad-cores storm the castle, anyway).</paragraph>
