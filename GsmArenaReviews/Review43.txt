			<paragraph>There are so many affordable touch phones on the market right now that it?s getting very hard to choose. We present to you the Samsung S5620, which brings high-end connectivity to the table in a modern, compact package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte packs the connectivity triumvirate ? 3G, Wi-Fi and GPS. Those are paired with an excellent web browser, as good as any we?ve seen on a feature phone. Unfortunately, there?s no voice-guided navigation to put the GPS receiver to full use. Of course, things like SatNav software are regional with Samsung so you might get a different deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not get ahead of ourselves, check out the rundown of the Samsung S5620 features:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S5620 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte is a couple of notches higher than the most popular entry-level touch phones of the day with its 3G and GPS. The extensive social networking integration makes this phone a great tool for today?s ultra-connected young crowd. The ActiveSync support that comes with a handy widget, the push notifications from Emoze and the document viewer will likely keep the S5620 in your hand during work hours too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the next page we take a sight-seeing tour around the exterior of the Samsung S5620 Monte.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing without a box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We got our test sample in a plain white box, but that?s how early test samples usually come by. The good thing is that we?ve also got the full suite of accessories that should make their way to the retail sales box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S5620 Monte comes paired with a one-piece headset that uses a 3.5mm audio jack. The data cable and the charger are usually no surprise, but this is the first time we see Samsung use this particular charger format. It looks exactly like what Nokia use for their mid- to high-end models.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S5620 Monte 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte measures 108.8 x 53.7 x 12.4mm. This makes it a tad bulkier than the Samsung S8000 Jet but it sits well in the hand thanks to the curved back and a weight of only 92 grams. It?s easily pocketable and all the controls are comfortable to use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte is unlikely to have any issues with fingerprints. The back is made from a nice, soft, matte plastic that does a pretty good job of hiding them. The front is made from the same plastic with a small chrome accent under the hardware keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Design-wise, the S5620 is totlllllally different from the 2009 Samsung portfolio, so when you see it for the first time, you almost instantly recognize it as a fresh device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colored sides and the angular look of the keys combined with the smooth arc of the rest of the design make for an edgy, futuristic exterior. It won?t appeal to executives but young people will certainly appreciate the styling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is 3 inches in diagonal, which seems to be standard fare for mid-range touch phones, with a 240 x 400 WQVGA resolution (again in line with the rest). It uses capacitive technology and it?s very sensitive, responding to even a very light touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen sunlight legibility is average as the possible viewing angles under direct sunlight are quite limited (narrow).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video call camera is above the display, left of the speaker grill. There is no proximity or ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three hardware buttons below the display - Call and End keys obviously and the center button. The center button brings up the main menu or toggles between the active app (if there is one) and the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are flat, level with the display and not very big, but they?re comfortable enough to use. The mic pinhole is located under the keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the phone you get the volume rocker and on the right side are the hardware Lock (or Hold) key and the shutter key. The microSD card slot is also on the right, covered by a plastic flap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top does not surprise at all nor does it disappoint - it houses a 3.5 mm audio jack and a standard microUSB port with a protective cover. The phone charges from the microUSB port - just like most of its recent siblings. The bottom is bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the 3 megapixel camera lens is on the back of the device. The back of the Samsung S5560 Monte also hosts the small loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera protrudes from the back and is in fact the most prominent feature there so the phone rests on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As an unfortunate coincidence, this both muffles the speaker when the phone is put on a flat surface and also leaves the camera very vulnerable to scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover you'll find a 1000 mAh battery and the SIM slot. The slot is on the left side of the device and is level with the the shutter key on the other side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte is very comfortable to hold in the hand, which is the result of the nice blend of the materials used and the curved back. At 92 grams the phone feels pretty light for its volume.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface goes TouchWiz 2.0 Plus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung is slowly moving towards their Bada OS, but the trusty TouchWiz user interface is not forgotten. It has been refined since our last meeting and enough has changed to earn it the Plus suffix. Some of the interface elements have a new look, so now they closely resemble the mock-ups of the Bada OS we?ve seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The transformation is by no means complete, but the Bada OS is based on TouchWiz and Samsung have been trying to unify the user interface regardless of platform, so we can see TouchWiz on feature phones creeping closer and closer in looks towards Bada.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Current TouchWiz users will feel pretty much at home with the Samsung S5620 Monte ? you get three different non-scrollable homescreens that you can alternate by sideways sweeps. The current selection is indicated by three numbered circles at the top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main homescreens feature is the widgets ? you can place around as many as you can fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of the traditional tray on the left, on the Samsung S5620 Monte the widgets tray has been moved to the bottom and is opened by a gear icon in the top left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case some of you have missed it, widgets are nifty mini-apps that reside on your home screen. Some of them seem to have more purpose, such as the calendar and world clock, image gallery or the mp3/radio players, while others range from fun to pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu stretches over several different screens (up to ten), which are sweep-scrollable sideways. That way almost all apps are accessible straight from the main menu, arranged in a flat iPhone-like structure. You will only need to dig deeper for the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte, like most recent Samsung phones, comes complete with multitasking. Pressing the menu key toggles between the application and the main menu, a long press brings up the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager has a nice 3D view and a more classical grid one. You can alternate or even close the tasks straight from there. A "End all applications" button is also present in case you don't want to waste time closing applications one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following in the footsteps of Samsung S5600 Preston, S5230 Star and the S8000 Jet too, Smart Unlock on the Samsung S5620 Monte allows users to not only unlock the phone but open a menu item or an application - even dial a contact - just by drawing a letter on the unlock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each letter from A to Z can be set to trigger one of those actions. For instance, you can use it to start features like the music player, messaging, web browser, Java apps or the dialing keypad. It also makes it a piece of cake to call some of your favorite contacts without even needing to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte features an accelerometer, which serves both for screen autorotate and for turn to mute, or as Samsung call it, ?etiquette pause?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo contacts is a fun way to browse your favorite contacts ? it uses a fake 3D environment and shows up to 8 contact pictures in an arc. You can scroll them up and down and dial the one you want. It's a slightly gimmicky interface, and we doubt that it will turn out to be practical in everyday use. Instead of a dedicated app, Photo contacts is now a widget you can place on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another helpful widget is Google Pointer ? it combines a search bar with shortcuts to Google Maps and Gmail. There are also social networking, ActiveSync and other helpful widgets, but we?ll get to them later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video displaying Samsung S5620 Monte in action:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery is an inherent part of the S5620 Monte file manager and launching it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep you fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list. Zooming is fast and easy thanks to the one finger zoom, while panning is lag-free as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also has a slideshow function and an accelerometer-based browsing feature. It lets you browse pictures in fullscreen landscape mode by simply tilting your phone on its side (plus, of course, you get automatic rotation of the photos by changing the device orientation).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard 3.5 mm audio jack and the microSD card slot, the S5620 music functionality is complemented by the great music player usually found on Samsung devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art takes the entire top half of the music player with the basic controls underneath it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the album art overlays additional controls - the progress indicator, a button to change the repeat mode, a shuffle button and an equalizer preset button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5620 Monte equalizer offers the standard presets like pop, jazz, classic as well as the sound enhancing widening, dynamic and surround effects. The DNSe sound enhancing technology offers Externalisation, Music clarity, Bass enhancement, Megabass, Wide and Concert hall presets for an even better sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find music service is a tap away and can be used to identify music playing from somewhere else, e.g. at the cafe', or it can sample music playing on the radio and bring up the song info.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte features an FM radio with RDS. The app itself got a facelift too and looks much better now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an option to record radio broadcasts as well, which can be a cheapo way to get individual tracks or whole song sets off the radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FM broadcast records are in the MP3 format, 192Kbps 32KHz for High quality (that results in about a megabyte for each recorded minute). You can also pause the recording if you want to skip the commercials for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio app is in the main menu but the Radio widget on the home screen gives you more immediate access. Tapping on it brings up the radio or you can just use the widget's controls to start/stop the radio or change the station. It can only skip between saved stations though, and if you want to search you'll have to do it in the actual app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of stations, you can save stations but they are labeled just by their frequency and you can't rename them. There's a separate list for your favorite stations though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bare-bone 3MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte is equipped with a 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera that can take photos with a maximum resolution of 2048x1536 pixels. The hardware is pretty bare-bones - all you get is the camera, no flash or lens protection, nothing besides the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's good that the camera still has a number of nice built-in features like smile shot, preset scenes, on-screen guidelines, geotagging and panorama mode. Geo-tagging is one of the features that puts the S5620 ahead of other similarly priced touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized - it's almost the same interface as on the Samsung Jet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a 3MP snapper, the camera on the Samsung S5620 is actually pretty good. Noise levels are low but the traces of the noise reduction algorithm are visible in the smudged details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is some oversharpening, but nothing too dramatic. At least photos usually turn out with pleasing colors. Here are several photo samples, so you can judge for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte offers video recording too, but it's nothing to get excited about - it can only manage QVGA at 15fps. Still, we wouldn?t use it for anything other than MMS. Now here's a sample if you want to check it out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent connectivity and browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte is very capable in the connectivity department with quad-band GSM and dual-band 3G with 3.6Mbps HSDPA. For local connectivity there?s Wi-Fi, so you don?t have to rely solely on carrier Internet connectivity. Of course, there?s also Bluetooth and the microUSB port, plus a hot-swappable microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5620 web browser is the excellent WebKit-based web browser, developed in-house by Samsung. With full Flash support, kinetic scrolling and one-finger zooming it is one of the finest web browsers we have seen so far, especially on a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software on the Samsung S5620 Monte sample we tested wasn?t quite yet complete, but panning was very responsive and fast and the double-tap plus one finger zoom combo make for almost effortless zooming.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications and a whole lot of widgets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We won't go into detail - the Organizer section of the S5560 Monte is just like the one on other Samsung feature phones running TouchWiz. We?re just going to point out the highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office document viewer for one - it's a regular feature of TouchWiz, but it's still a big deal for feature phones. Office 2007 documents are supported, which is good news if you have to view a file saved with a recent copy of Office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exchange ActiveSync support is also present, which should appeal to corporate users. There?s even handy widget, which lets you perform synchronization, create a new email, check for new emails and toggle push messaging. It can be minimized so it doesn?t take much space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung S5620 MOnte comes with the Palringo instant messenger preinstalled. It supports various protocols ? Gtalk, ICQ, AIM and MSN. It can handle multiple chats at once and has the option to share your location. Registration is easy and adding new services is pain-free as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Facebook and MySpace are easily accessible through their preinstalled applications. Both apps have dedicated widgets, which offer the basic functionality right off the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Twitter doesn?t get a dedicated app, just a widget. While it looks comfortable enough to post a tweet, it doesn?t look that good at all if you have more than just a few tweets to read.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a Bebo widget as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Emoze app offers push updates for your Gmail, Outlook WEB Access, Facebook and generic POP3 and IMAP email accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an extensive editor for photos as well as the Communities app, which helps you upload data to content sharing sites like YouTube, Flickr, Facebook, MySpace, Picasa and a few others. It will automatically resize images and has a handy account manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s Google Maps, which is not really a substitute for proper SatNav software, something that the the Samsung S5620 Monte sadly lacks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5620 Monte certainly has an edge on affordable touch phones with its 3G, Wi-Fi and GPS capabilities. But it's stepping on the toes of mid-range smartphones whose prices keep coming down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smartphones shouldn't be underestimated - the ability to install additional native applications (including a choice of SatNav solutions) lets you use the hardware you paid for to the fullest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's take a quick peek at the competition that is already out and about without getting into too much detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE matches most of what the Samsung S5620 has got to offer, but tops it with Windows Mobile 6.5 OS and a 667MHz CPU plus built-in Office document editor, DivX/XviD support and the possibility to install navigation software. It covers WinMo with TouchWiz so on the surface both phones have very similar interfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung B7300 OmniaLITE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Three HTCs also make the cut - the HTC Touch2, HTC Touch 3G and HTC Tattoo. The first two run WinMo, while the Tattoo is powered by Android. They have smaller 2.8" HVGA screens. The Touch 3G has been out for a while so you could probably find a good deal on it, and the Tattoo has fun back covers that can be personalized and the Android OS is really on the up and up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Touch2 ? HTC Touch 3G ? HTC Tattoo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is still hanging around, the nHD resolution screen and the rich retail box - 8GB microSD card, TV-out cable and a carrying case - mean it scores a high bang-for-your-buck rating. And there's the Nokia 5800 Navigation Edition if it's the GPS that led you here in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 5800 XpressMusic ? Nokia 5800 Navigation Edition</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feature phone is a dying breed. Samsung's Bada OS aims to create "a smartphone for everyone" and all the other manufacturers seem to be heading that way too. But if it happens that the Samsung S5620 Monte is one of the last midrange feature phones, then feature phones will surely go out with a bang. It's the latest result of the march of feature phones towards catching up with smartphones, while offering unsurpassed simplicity of use.</paragraph>
