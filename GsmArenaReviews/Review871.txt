			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's pole position in smartphones doesn't necessarily mean a win in tablets but it sure is an advantage and the Koreans won't give up on it easily. The Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is standing at the very top of a lineup, whose fourth generation has hit the fast lane again after a less than impressive showing last season. This here Note Pro has unique size and all the S Features the company has developed so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet's business aspirations are made clear by the KNOX enterprise security feature and rich app package that includes a full-blown office document editor, collaboration tools and even subscriptions to business publications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an artistic side to it too, enabled by the S Pen and an advanced drawing app, while the Multi-window split-screen multitasking has grown to support up to four apps at a time (made possible by the larger screen). And that's before the floating apps come in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The size of the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is controversial, but Samsung already has the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014). It's also the feature that sets it apart in a good way - some people prefer larger laptops to tiny ultrabooks and that carries over to tablets as well. The work you did on the office PC just looks different when shown on a small 10" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 10 Mar: we received a retail unit for retesting and updated this review with new images and information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen Android tablets try to wedge into the ultrabook market by adding a detachable QWERTY keyboard. Those efforts brought mixed results, but will a bigger screen do better?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is a gamble for Samsung, but the company can afford it - the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014) are there to catch the users the Note Pro 12.2 will miss. The Galaxy Note phablet was a gamble too and look how that turned out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 retail box uses recycled paper and other than the tablet itself, it features a powerful 2A charger with a detachable microUSB 3.0 cable. There are also spare tips for the S Pen stylus and a metal tweezers-like tool to replace the old tip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is from the 2013 phase of Samsung's design - that means a metallic strip on the side accentuating the faux leather back. In terms of looks, the tablet fits in both formal and casual settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The faux leather material on the back is a soft touch plastic with a leather texture that looks and, more importantly, feels convincing (down to the stitching detail). It's perhaps not as cool as aluminum (for some) but we shudder at the thought of how much the tablet would have weighed if it was made of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As things stand now the weight is 753g (for both LTE and Wi-Fi only versions), which is quite a bit to hold in one hand for long periods of time. It's not impossible, but you will be much better off resting your hand against a desk or a table. Then again the same although to a somewhat lesser extent is true for the 10" tablets, so maybe the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 isn't in too bad a position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen bezel is just wide enough to allow a comfortable grip, but again it's not for more than a few minutes of work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something the size of the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 was meant to be used propped up on your lap or on a stand. Alternatively, for drawing you can leave it flat on the table like you would a sheet of paper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung chose to put the microUSB port on the right side of the tablet rather than at the bottom, which will make stands more complicated. The two loudspeakers are on the sides of the tablet so docking in portrait mode will cut off one of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger issue is that the hardware keys move to an uncomfortable position (on-screen buttons would have been better here). Also, some people like large portrait screens (it's comfortable for reading long passages of text) but others don't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has not announced any docks for the Note Pro 12.2 yet, but there's the Smart Cover that will keep the tablet upright (or at a slight angle). Also, during the announcement at CES, the company showed a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, which makes for a setup reminiscent of All-in-One computers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To complete the portable workstation, Samsung also unveiled a microUSB to Ethernet adaptor. That's great for places without Wi-Fi (or where it's much more expensive than cable).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of input methods, the S Pen is a trademark of the Note series and uses a separate digitizer layer. It's pressure sensitive (which makes a world of difference for drawing) and can be detected from an inch away (which makes for some interesting hover interactions).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has a 12.2" Super Clear LCD display at 2,560 x 1,600px of resolution. Like on the Note Pro 10.1, it's an RGBW display, meaning there are two sub-pixels per each pixel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That makes it easier to boost the brightness in a power-efficient manner (since the White pixel does exactly that), but it affects the look of the display. The pixel density is 247ppi, a bit lower than 10" tablets, which combined with the RGBW matrix results in a visible cross-hatch pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The RGBW matrix of the Note Pro 12.2's screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's nothing annoying and text remains sharp even with small fonts and the effect is only noticeable from up close - larger screens are viewed from a bigger distance in general and this is among the largest in the market. Anyway, it's exactly the larger-than-usual screen that makes the Note Pro 12.2 interesting and makes the multitasking so much more powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The colors on the screen are vivid and the viewing angles are very good. Samsung has included its custom Screen mode where the Auto Adapt Display setting adjusts the display performance based on the content - it only works in several apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other settings include Movie (which sets a warmer white balance and boosts the contrast), Dynamic (which boosts the saturation) and Standard (which aims for accurate white balance and saturation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is fairly bright and with good contrast, even though black levels are not perfect. The screen handles reflections well and remains legible even in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the S Pen as one of the trademark features of the Samsung Galaxy Note devices. It works with a second digitizer borrowed from Wacom, which detects only the S Pen stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advantage is that your skin is ignored and you can place your palm on the screen while you're drawing for a more natural, comfortable experience. S Pen offers another advantage too, pressure sensitivity, which is a must-have for drawing. Then there's the ability to detect the S Pen from a distance to show helpful tooltips and activate other features.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 follows the design of the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014). That means landscape is the default orientation and the hardware keys are placed along one of the long sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are the App Switcher, Home and Back buttons. The capacitive App Switcher and Back keys work with the S Pen, but they stay fixed in place, which is now an even bigger problem on the larger tablet (if you hold the tablet in portrait, the keys are hard to reach). It's time Samsung considered on-screen buttons on tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is the ambient light sensor and the 2MP/1080p video-call camera. The screen bezels are just big enough to allow room for your thumb when handling the large slab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 have the same grooved metallic texture we saw on the Note 3 phablet. It adds a nice accent to the otherwise all-black exterior. A white version of the Note Pro 12.2 is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the tablet features the Power button and volume rocker. Those are virtually impossible to reach with one hand, but then so is almost everything else about this tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on top is the IR blaster and a microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has stereo speakers on the short sides. The S Pen compartment is on the right, along with the microUSB 3.0 port (back compatible with microUSB 2.0) and the microSD card slot, which is sealed by a plastic flap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is on the left side of the tablet and there's nothing on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The massive back is home only to the 8MP camera and its LED flash. While we're not fans of tablet photography (especially with a tablet this size) the camera does have its legitimate uses - the pre-installed drawing app lets you snap a reference photo to draw over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover is massive 9,500mAh battery. We ran our own battery tests for web browsing and video playback, check the results in the next section.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 features a big 9,500mAh battery, but it has an enormous screen to feed. We have the Wi-Fi only version of the tablet (with an Exynos chipset) so we tested only the web browsing and video playback times and both came out around nine and a half hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014) that's nearly two hours better on the web browser and a bit better for the video player. By our calculations, the 12.2" screen has 46% more surface area to light up compared to the 10.1", while the battery is only 16% bigger so that's quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air does go 40 minutes longer on the web test and three hours more on the video test, but the same screen size considerations apply.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.4 KitKat and TouchWiz UI is all you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 runs on the latest available Android 4.4.2 KitKat, with lots of premium features courtesy of Samsung's own TouchWiz UI. Samsung has included many must-have options on such a big screen, including a new version of the Multi-window multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of widgets, the lockscreen has something called "Lock screen cards." Those can show you weather info, upcoming events, news, email and social networking updates. You can pick and choose which of these features you want active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is similar to what we've seen on other Pro tablets - it's narrow and has a flat design with circular icons. The toggles work as usual and below them are two sliders, one for brightness and one for volume. The brightness slider has an Auto toggle. The sliders can be hidden to save space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the app drawer, icons are presented as a customizable or alphabetized grid and you can also view only the ones apps you've downloaded yourself. You can also disable some of the pre-installed apps so they won't take any RAM or appear in the app drawer, but not all apps can be hidden this way as the hide shortcuts feature has gone missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen has been updated as well and features Magazine UI. This adds a second type of homescreen alongside the traditional TouchWiz panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Magazine UI is a fully functional replacement for you homescreen that does way more than just feed you news and social updates. A Magazine pane would hold up to six widgets, but those widgets always occupy the entire screen - there is no background or docked shortcuts, even the status bar is hidden. You have to tap the top of the screen to bring it back, which means basics like the time and signal strength are not always visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Magazine's widgets are completely different from what you have seen so far on Android. They use flat looks a la Windows Phone, they can be easily resized and rearranged. A Change Layout button automatically cycles through preset layouts so you don't even have to tap and drag (but you can if you want to).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available set of widgets is what really makes the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and its Magazine UI so feature-rich. Note that only Samsung-made widgets go here, the widgets used on the TouchWiz homescreen panes are not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Magazine widgets are a mixture of various content aggregators (news, social services, multimedia), powerful mini versions of system apps and just nicely designed shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The content aggregators support news from a lot of categories (business, design, movies, food, music, sports, politics, travel, tech, etc.) and social services (500px, Facebook, Twitter). You can choose the specific topics for each Magazine widget. Some widgets are scrollable so they hold more content even if it's not immediately obvious. You have to swipe at them to see if they'll scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aggregators aside, the rest of the widgets give you quick access to the most used apps: gallery, office, hubs, calendar, weather and multimedia players. Finally, you have two different widgets that hold your Favorite and Frequently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have up to three Magazine homescreen panes. We guess this is partly due to hardware limitations, because those Magazine widgets probably consume a lot of resources. Also, since only special widgets are allowed, you can't fill much more anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has an App Switcher button that calls up a custom switcher UI. The only real difference is that it takes up only the bottom part of the screen rather than overlay it. Samsung's Task Manager is also on board for more advanced options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 comes with the Multi-window multitasking feature, and it has been improved to now support up to four apps at a time (two and three apps is also easily doable). The apps are tiled (so no app overlays another) and you can control the divide by dragging the center dot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can replace apps in each slot and then use the additional app switching feature to bring back apps that were previously in each slot. You can even create pairings off apps, which get a dedicated shortcut that opens all the apps and splits the screen as it was at the time the pairing was created. This can be very convenient for apps that go well together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Copying stuff across the opened apps is enabled and is done in just three taps. Note that only a few apps work with Multi-window but more can be found in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also run apps that do overlay other apps using the Pen Window feature of S Pen. You draw a rectangle and the tablet will create a window roughly that size to run the selected app in. The size of these apps can be reduced to just the app icon, if you need to get them out of the way. Even fewer apps support Pen Window than Multi-window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu has a tabbed interface. On top you get four tabs - Connection, Device, Controls and General and you can find the relative features in their corresponding place - display, for instance, is in the Device tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has the same screen resolution as the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014), the interface looks mostly the same except upscaled by about 20%. Samsung gives you the option to control font size, which does help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really like the new Multi-window feature that essentially gives you four 6.1" WXGA (1280 x 800) screens to work with. We do wish the notification area was more sensible though, at the moment it's the same as one on a 4" phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S Pen apps and gestures<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once you pull the S Pen out, the Air Command menu pops up. The menu is available throughout the UI. It's a virtual ring with five shortcuts - Action Memo, Scrap Booker, Screen Write, S Finder and Pen Window. If you prefer, you can set Action Memo to pop up instead or just nothing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Memo lets you write stuff and then use it to initiate an action - i.e. add a contact name and number to your phonebook, or check out an address on Google Maps. You just need to mark a part of the text and send it to one of the supporting apps. The handwriting recognition is impressively fast and accurate - it handles just about everything you throw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrap Booker lets you add pieces of your screen to... well, a Scrapbook. You don't need to take a full screenshot - just mark the stuff you need. The Scrap Booker will automatically extract pictures and text from the selected area and will save them to one of your Scrapbook categories. You can then add an optional memo to every scrapbook entry you create.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen Write allows you to start writing on the display no matter what screen you are on. You can either use a clean sheet or use a snapshot of the screen you are currently using. It's the best tool for taking quick memos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Finder is a local search that'll browse through all the content on your Note Pro 12.2 with preset filters. It can search in all S Pen content you've added (including notes, scrapbook pages, etc.), messages, multimedia, settings, phonebook, even the internet. Naturally, all handwritten stuff is an easy job for the S Finder. You can even search for symbols you've drawn with the S Pen. That last one seems to work quite slowly however, and unless you actually use the scrapbook quite a lot you probably won't need it that often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last element of the Air Command menu is Pen Window, which we covered in the previous section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen also supports Air View - when you're hovering the S Pen over text or an image, the software responds and brings a larger popup version of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Smart Stay and Smart Rotate features are enabled too. Stay prevents the screen from locking as long as the front-facing camera can see your face (great for reading) and Rotate uses the orientation of your face rather than accelerometer info to decide how to rotate the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Scroll is yet another feature that leverages on the front-facing camera - it allows you to scroll up and down by tilting the tablet or by tilting your head. It's a bit hard to get used to, but once you do it' can be useful in certain scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another Samsung-exclusive feature is dubbed Smart Pause. While watching a video, it uses the front-facing camera to track your face and will automatically pause the video when you look away. Look back at the screen and the playback continues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a basic set of motion gestures as well - you can zoom, move stuff or browse images by tilting or panning the device. You can also pause the music player by putting your palm on the screen. A palm swipe takes a screenshot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 tablet features both Google Now and Samsung's S Voice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now also has its own dedicated homescreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice can be used to dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search-focused it tries to do more on the actual tablet and it has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 to snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The only problem with S Voice is it's not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Google Now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is powered by either an Exynos 5420 or a Snapdragon 800, depending on whether you get the Wi-Fi only or the LTE model. Both pack 3GB of RAM but differ on everything else as far as the chipset is concerned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, Samsung did a very good job of balancing the Galaxy S4 with Snapdragon 600 and Exynos 5410 to give them equal performance. We have the Exynos-powered Note Pro 12.2 with four Cortex-A15 cores at 1.9GHz and another four Cortex-A7 cores at 1.3GHz processor. The GPU is a new Mali T628MP6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 800 model has four Krait 400 cores at 2.3 and Adreno 330, its performance should be quite familiar by now (it powers most of the recent flagship devices, including the Galaxy Note 3 phablet).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It terms of CPU power, it seems that the four Cortex-A15 cores lag behind the Krait 400 alternative. The difference is slim, but the Exynos-powered Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 was behind the Note 3 phablet, its results consistent with the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014) powered by the same Exynos chipset.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We also ran the AnTuTu 4 full system benchmark where the Note Pro 12.2 came out on top, slightly ahead of the other Cortex-A15 tablets (including the Transformer Pad TF701T, which has a Tegra 4 chipset).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>How much did the GPU help for that result? Not much as it turns out. The Mali T628MP6 GPU has tangibly less performance in the GFXBench 1080p off-screen tests. Performance is nothing special on the older 2.7 T-Rex bench, but nearly double on the newer 3.0 Manhattan tests.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Those were off-screen tests and the 2,560 x 1,600 resolution of the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 screen takes quite a toll. The tablet managed a playable (but barely) framerate in Epic Citadel Ultra quality, which uses the popular Unreal Engine. Keep in mind that dropping to High Quality pushes the framerate to nearly 60fps.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 offers flagship performance but users have a decision to make - the Exynos-powered version is marginally slower than the Snapdragon one, mainly felt in the graphics department. But the Snapdragon model comes with LTE Cat. 4 support and commands a higher price respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Is it worth getting the LTE model even though you won't use mobile data? No, the difference isn't worth the price jump. However, the extra speed is a bonus for those who do need LTE.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 comes in Wi-Fi only and LTE versions but neither features voice call functionality. There's still a Contacts app for all the other methods of communication.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account and your social networks. The list of contacts is displayed on the left and the available info on the currently selected contact on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are listed by either first or last name, depending on preference. There is a handy search field in the top left corner, as well as an alphabet scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your own contact info is treated differently and adds a third panel on the screen with your recent posts on Google+. We wish this worked for other contacts and their social network posts too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced menu offers a few more options: edit contact, import/export, join contacts, send or print namecards, get friends via social services, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a single contact takes place in a popup window, where the available fields are displayed, with plus and minus signs on the right that let you remove or duplicate details. There's also an Add another field button at the bottom that lets you insert a field that hasn't existed so far for the specific contact. Custom field names aren't available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 comes with two familiar email applications out of the box - one for your Gmail and a generic app to use with any POP3/IMAP account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have a split-screen interface. Initially, your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single message, the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bulk actions are supported too, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get tons of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail is smart about categorizing messages and grouping them - e.g. all promotions go in a folder, all social networking-related messages in another and so on, keeping the Primary folder clean and containing only the important stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app can handle multiple Gmail accounts, but doesn't offer a combined inbox, while the generic email client supports any email service and has a combined inbox. The two panel interface can also be adjusted by dragging the separating line between the two panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A couple of chat applications are preloaded on the Note Pro 12.2 to make up for the lack of SMS support. Google's Hangouts does IM complete with group chat and sending photos, but it can also handle video chat too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Samsung's proprietary ChatOn. It adds some social flare with a custom page for each user, which you can follow. This includes Facebook-style pages for sports teams and web sites rather than just individuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung QWERTY keyboard occupies about half of the screen. That makes it rather large, so there are two additional keyboard layouts to try and suit everyone's taste. You can opt for the small floating keyboard and a split keyboard too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Choosing the latter allows you to quickly thumb-type while holding the tablet (much better on a 12.2" tablet than reaching for keys in the middle of the screen). It also leaves much more room for text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several other options are available to make text input easier, including various options for predictive text and auto correction. Swipe input is also supported or if you disable it, you can swipe left and right on the keyboard to move the cursor. The large keyboard does have arrow keys though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you tap a field with the S Pen, the keyboard can automatically switch to handwriting recognition, which works very well. This is great for alphabets too complicated for a keyboard and can be disabled if you prefer to swipe over the on-screen QWERTY with the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dictation is also available with an option to work offline (provided you download the necessary files first). Note that this is not as accurate as the online version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an alternative keyboard view that shows the clipboard and all the items you've recently copied.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Capable gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, people and favorites. You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails (four or five on a row).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air view works in the gallery as well. You can hover your finger above an image and you'll get a bigger thumbnail preview of the image or you can use it to peek inside folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that album's stack of photos but a swipe to the right will reveal a bar with all the albums. This means you can change albums without going through the gallery homescreen every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a press and hold on a picture, you'll be able to select multiple images, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single photo view has several shortcuts for sharing (via an app or over DLNA) and a delete button. At the bottom is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily retouch photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects, plus a few fun options like stickers and custom frames. You can also make a memo on top of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a couple of ways to create a handwritten note for each photo. One creates a Polaroid-like frame and lets you scribble the note (this is easy to share) or to write a note and store it separately (harder to share, but nondestructive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature is Buddy photo share - it recognizes faces in a photo, you link those to your contacts and the tablet will learn to recognize them itself. Then the faces in the photo become handy shortcuts to that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Desktop-like file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The My Files app organizes your files into categories - Images, Videos, Music, Documents, Downloaded apps, Recent files and even Dropbox files. Those categories are always visible at the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split between folders and their content (with a complete tree view, similar to Windows Explorer).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive). More advanced functions include handling ZIP files and connecting to FTP servers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Feature rich, user-friendly music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy Pro 12.2 is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC. The player uses the same split-screen interface as most other apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album and Playlist, Folders and DLNA devices. There's also the Music square - the Note Pro 12.2 scans your music library rating each track in terms of tempo (Exciting or Calm) and emotion (Passionate or Joyful) and will load a playlist matching your chosen tempo and mood. The emotion axis in the graph can be switched to Age, which makes it easy to automatically create a playlist of classics or new tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options: a timescroll, playback controls, an AllShare shortcut. A coverflow-like list of album art lets you know what the next song will be and is an easy way to skip to it. The music player will also try to find the lyrics for the song you're listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled several audio-enhancement features. The equalizer presets are cleverly organized into a square similar to the Music Square. The presets balance between Treble and Bass, Vocals and Instrumental. You can also just tap the Auto toggle and enable a Tube amp effect, 7.1 channel virtualization, along with Studio, Club and Concert Hall effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced view of the equalizer gives you a proper seven band equalizer you can tune manually and enable additional effects like 3D, Bass and Clarity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of audio features doesn't end here. Smart sound will keep the sound level consistent between tracks, while Adapt sound tests the performance of your headphones and tunes the equalizer based on that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While our Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 doesn't have telephony features, we still tested the loudspeaker performance as it will be used for music and videos. It scored a Good score and we can confirm the stereo speakers are indeed fairly loud. It helps that the speakers are one each on the sides of the wide tablet, which enhances the stereo effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player lacks support for key codecs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new video player found on the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 makes use of the Multi-window feature. When you play a video (in the video app or even in the file browser), the app gets the left half of the screen, while the video is played on the right side (and you can adjust the split).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is pretty neat, especially if you're just clicking through videos, wondering what to watch). Switching to fullscreen is as easy as dragging the separating dot to the edge of the screen. Pop Up play is also enabled if you want the video to play in a small, floating window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the video player interface has three tabs - Personal, Downloads and Nearby devices - complete with a search field. The available videos are shown as a grid of animated thumbnails, but list and folder view are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If subtitles are available, the video player will automatically find and load them. You can also manually load subtitles if the video and subtitle file names don't match. You can change the zoom mode (100%, fit to screen with and without affecting the videos aspect ratio) and there's a pinch zoom too, in case you want to get close to a specific part of the action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Codec support is pretty dismal, however. Most videos we tried resulted in an "audio codec not supported" message and even some basic video codecs don't work (i.e. DivX). MKV, AVI (XviD) and MP4 videos do play, but anything beyond MP3 or AAC sound is no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note that we used the Wi-Fi only version of the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2, which is based on Samsung's Exynos chipset. The Snapdragon-powered LTE version might do better in this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology from the music player is available here too. There are additional settings for the brightness, playback speed and feeding the audio through Bluetooth (if you have wireless speakers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop Up Play was Samsung's first foray into floating apps and is still available. You can move and resize the video window so it doesn't get in the way of other apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is as clean as it gets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 matched the performance of the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition in our audio quality test. It showed amazingly clean output in the first trial and even though it was about average in terms of loudness the overall impression is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The huge slate wasn't particularly bothered when we plugged in a pair of headphones either and put in another great performance. The solitary affected reading was stereo crosstalk and even that remained great.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8MP camera does an excellent job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 features an 8 megapixel main camera and a 2 megapixel front-facer, with 1080p video recording enabled for both. If you thought that snapping a photo with a 10" slab is awkward, the 12.2" Note Pro makes it even worse, but we're sure some people will still use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is based on the new generation Samsung camera UI. A single viewfinder handles both still and video capture, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution as, if you're shooting full resolution 8MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a wide variety of settings but they are partitioned into different areas. Color effects (with a live preview for each) are at the bottom of the screen. You can download more effects from Samsung Apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another place with cool settings is the Mode button, which brings out a carousel of advanced features (you can switch to grid view, but we find the carousel more thumb-friendly). The features include standard stuff like HDR (called Rich tone) and Panorama, along with proprietary Samsung features such as Eraser (remove moving objects), Drama (replicate moving objects), Sound &amp; shot (capture ambient sound to go with the photo) and Best photo, Best and Beauty face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are even more options, some of which are visible in the top left corner. For the rest, you'll have to go into the full settings menu. These include burst shot, face detection, manual ISO setting, Smart stabilization and so on. Voice controls are enabled if you want to take a shot hands-free (e.g. a group shot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One interesting feature that deserves a special mention is dual shot, which does a picture-in-picture effect using both cameras. One camera is put in a small window (with a customizable frame) and can be moved and resized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 camera produces high-quality photos for the class - good level of resolved detail, low noise and decent color rendering. The white balance is slightly warm as the camera boosts the green channel. There are some issues, like the noticeable oversharpening halos, but those are minor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 also features HDR mode, which does an excellent job of adding more detail in the highlights without overdoing it and producing unrealistic shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a tablet camera it will see less use than a phone camera, but if you ever need to snap a pic with the Note Pro 12.2 rather than your phone, the results will be on par.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 has an 8MP camera, which is a little outdated, but tablets have lagged behind their smartphone siblings. Its performance is pretty much on par with most of the 8MP cameraphones out there - good of Samsung to not have overlooked this in a tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p videos are pretty cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 shoots 1080p videos but there's a catch. The Wi-Fi-only flavor record the 1080p videos at 30fps, while the LTE model can go up to 60fps. There's digital video stabilization available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 stores videos in MP4 files with 17Mbps bitrate on average. Stereo audio is recorded at a bitrate of 128Kbps and 48kHz sampling rate. Those are the same basic numbers as the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera doesn't have many fancy shooting modes like the still camera, but dual shot is available and you can do time lapse videos. The time lapse videos can speed things up to 8x, with resolution and frame rate remaining at 1080p @ 30fps (time lapse actually requires less processing power than regular video capture).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available before and during video recording and you can switch back to continuous autofocus if you prefer. You can capture 6MP (16:9) photos during recording as well, their image quality seems quite decent too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos shot with the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 have a good amount of resolved detail, steady framerate and little noise. Colors and white balance are similar to those in still images. It can certainly give phones that shoot 1080p video a run for their money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a 1080p video sample from the slate that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out the untouched 1080p@30fps sample that we captured with the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Rich connectivity misses NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 comes in two flavors - Wi-Fi only and LTE. The LTE model is powered by the Snapdragon 800 chipset and features quad-band GSM and 3G support with HSPDA up to 42Mbps. The LTE support covers six bands and is category 4, which means you get up to 150Mbps downlink and up to 50Mbps uplink speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both tablet versions feature Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac support, with 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA support are also available. Bluetooth 4.0 handles local connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both models of the Note Pro 12.2 feature GPS and GLONASS receivers, unlike some tablets that omit accurate positioning methods on the Wi-Fi only models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microSD card slot as well, on top of the 32/64GB of internal storage. All that storage can be filled quickly enough thanks to the microUSB 3.0 port. It's backward-compatible with microUSB 2.0 if you don't happen to have a USB 3.0 cable around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 also supports USB-on-the-go, but you will need to buy an adapter for that. The tablet can work with USB storage, mice and keyboards (but Samsung also offers Bluetooth mice and keyboards).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also buy an HDMI adapter and connect the tablet to your HDTV with a regular cable. Yet another adapter you can grab for the Note Pro 12.2 is an Ethernet to microUSB adapter for connecting to wired LAN networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An IR blaster on top allows the tablet to control TV's and other devices using Samsung's WatchON app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last piece of the connectivity puzzle, NFC, is missing as it was on the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 edition).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 comes with both the stock Android browser (customized by Samsung) and Google's Chrome. Both support Multi-window, but only the stock browser supports Pen Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the interfaces of both browsers are virtually identical. Tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser, and the address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field (with a voice input shortcut).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both browsers feature incognito tabs and request desktop view. Chrome has a Google-powered feature that syncs open tabs between devices that run Chrome, but Samsung has integrated a similar feature into the stock browser (this one goes through your Samsung account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new tab page for Chrome shows a grid of often visited sites and other options, while the stock browser just loads the home page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air view, Smart scroll and Smart stay all work in the browser, the first of which lets you simply hover your S Pen over a web element and it will act as if a mouse cursor was over it instead, which is great for websites not optimized for mobile devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for plug-ins.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Premium apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has positioned the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 as the premium tablet in the lineup and as such it comes with a rich app package that most other tablets don't get (even other Galaxy Pro tablets). These are mostly centered around productivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual suspects - Flipboard, Dropbox (with 50GB for two years bonus), Evernote and TripAdvisor - are on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the more interesting are Office apps from Hancom Office - Hword, Hcell and Hshow. They feature interfaces similar to the desktop Microsoft Office apps, meaning they are busy with tons of buttons. While they can be operated with a finger or the S Pen, we get the feeling it would be more comfortable to use a mouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, it's hard to use those apps without an external keyboard too - the large QWERTY just takes up too much space (from what little was left with such a complicated UI). You can switch to one of the smaller on-screen keyboards in a pinch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't think that we're knocking these apps - they really do feel like a desktop Office package and we think this is intentional. For one, it would make people who are not tech savvy feel at home and also they are packed to the rafters with features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is followed up by two collaboration apps - Cisco WebEx and Samsung e-Meeting. The first handles conferencing (complete with screen-sharing), while the second handles sharing content without the need for a central server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more - if you're going to connect a keyboard and mouse to the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2, you can launch Remote PC, which is just what it sounds like. It gives you remote access to your home or office PC, which works rather well on the large screen. SideSync does something similar, just in reverse. It shares windows and data between a computer and the tablet, so you can manage it on you PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bespoke Sketchbook app will be of great interest to artists - it's a sketching app that makes full use of the S Pen, including pressure sensitivity. The app supports layers with blending modes, visual guides and symmetry tools. It turns the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 into a powerful tool for digital artists that can replace Photoshop and a Wacom tablet setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The premium app package is said to include $700 worth of apps and tools. A lot of that is for subscriptions actually - one year BusinessWeek+, 12 weeks of NY Times, 6 months of Livesport.tv, 3 months of LinkedIn. There's a free Oxford's Advanced Learners Dictionary too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other apps are included as well, like Bitcasa, which offers a lot more storage than Dropbox - a whopping 1TB - but the subscription is for three months only. Note that RemotePC is also subscription-based (2 years) and so are Evernote (3-12 month subscription, market dependent) and LinkedIn (3 months of Premium Membership).</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 features a wide range of proprietary TouchWiz applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Note lets you create and customize notebooks. There is a total of 9 preset notebook styles to choose from. After you're done creating a notebook you can go ahead and fill it with notes, drawings (with rich brush options), images, video, voice memos, charts or illustrations, maps, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's yet another note-taking tool called Action Memo. Handwriting recognition kicks in to digitally transform your handwritten notes - for example, scribbling down someone's phone number later lets you tap on the number and save it directly to the phonebook, without having to retype it. This also works for email accounts, street addresses, tasks and general searches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrapbook lets you keep any content you browse through on the Note Pro 12.2's screen. You can scrapbook something by circling it with the S Pen with the button pressed. Each item can then be put into a category and filtered by location (i.e. where you were when you added something).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also preloaded the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 with a video editor to complement the photo editor. You can use the Story album to automatically group photos and videos based on the time and location they were taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the cool apps is Group Play. It shares various multimedia across multiple devices in the same room, but unlike DLNA it's interactive. You can share music (to play through the speakers of all connected devices), images and documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi Vision on the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 allows you to stack up several devices and get a bigger resulting screen area for your content. The downside of Group Play is that it's a Samsung-only feature, which limits its applicability.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android calendar has been replaced with S Planner (as usual). It features six different views: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, list and tasks. For the month view, events on the selected day are listed in a panel on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder. Multiple online calendars are supported and they can be color-coded for easier recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator app has been redesigned to make better use of the large screen. To the left it features a history of recent calculations and the advanced buttons (e.g. trigonometry) are always visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm app is quite advanced too. Each alarm has its own repeat pattern, tone, snooze and repeat settings. It also features Smart alarm (ring quietly, slowly turning the volume up for a more gentle wakeup) and a Location alarm, which only triggers if you're in a predefined location (i.e. disable the get up for work alarm if you wake up somewhere other than home).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock app is full of eye-candy. You get an animated globe where you can pick time zones or cities, there are country flags, day and night animations, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation, where available<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Wi-Fi only and LTE versions of the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 come with a GPS receiver. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning is another quick (but less accurate) option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution already. Not that there are easy ways to make a 12.2" tablet fit your car's interior. It's still great for reviewing routes you can later navigate with your phone. The public transport option can be very useful too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also supports the Street View mode, allowing you to see the landmarks you're looking for before you set off. That makes them much easier to find when you arrive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play is where the Android apps are<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide whether the app is worth it. Google has added a small "designed for phones" warning for apps that don't have tablet interfaces. Those can look bad on the large screen, so it's nice to be forewarned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps. From music / video players, to file managers and various tools, you'll always see something worth trying. The problem is those specifically optimized for tablets are only a fraction of all available apps. Some of the rest scale pretty well to the large screen, but some simply end up pixelated and downright poorly looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has naturally made its own Apps store available. It features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find far fewer apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is to most Android tablets what the Galaxy Note was to phones when the term "phablet" was not even coined yet. One's first reaction is "it's huge" but then after using it for a while other devices just seem too small.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung would love to have the business tablet - BlackBerry's PlayBook failed, the HP TouchPad failed, leaving the Apple iPad as the de facto business tablet. So far most Android slates were okay personal devices but turned no heads at the office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tide could be turning - the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is nearly the size of an ultrabook and it has the processing power of some of the earlier models. The change in screen size seems trivial on paper but it's a nearly 50% increase in surface area and almost enough to fit an A4 page at 100%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference when working with documents is tangible, but the advantages of a larger screen extend to multitasking too. The latest incarnation of Multi-window allows for a fluid workflow similar to desktop experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the Note Pro 12.2 is virtually identical to the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014). It has a fast chipset (but no faster than a flagship phone), a body that finds good balance between build quality, durability and weight, and a thing or two to make it stand out against the sea of Android tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first of those things is the S Pen which, depending on the user, can be the best thing ever or a mere plug for the compartment hole. But it was really the updated multitasking on the big screen that was the standout feature for us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014) is a perfectly fine alternative to the Pro 12.2, especially if you want a bit more portability. It does lack a bit of that special feel though, it's a great 10.1" Android tablet, but that doesn't tickle our buying bone. The Note Pro 12.2 is simply the first of its kind and thus a lot more desirable, but it's also way more expensive which makes the choice even tougher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Transformer Pad TF701T is the latest refinement of the hybrid device and offers far better value for money, but it's just the old formula with fresher ingredients. Having a hardware QWERTY and a bigger battery is great, but if you haven't bought a Transformer already, chances are you'll skip this generation too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Transformer Pad TF701T</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air is, by virtue of its predecessors, the tablet to beat. It's beautiful and light, it feels familiar to the millions who have iPhones and grants access to Apple's walled garden (full of apps, music and accessories you've bought).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad Air</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has the Surface 2 and Lumia 2520 to offer as an extension of its own ecosystem that is the backbone of businesses worldwide. The Surface in particular is enjoying growing interest by consumers. Windows 8.x is still a sliver of what 7 and XP are to the market though, ironically Android and iOS are the OSes that push hardware in the tablet field rather than the Windows name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Microsoft Surface 2 ? Nokia Lumia 2520</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going from 10.1" to 12.2" sounds like a small difference, some might dismiss it as negligible. We found that it's anything but - in the end, the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 might prove too big for the majority and, but using it for a while puts other tablets in perspective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And this brings us to the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2's biggest problem. For all the good it does, its steep pricing means that few will actually give it a chance. Oh well, we guess reaching the masses was never the point of this device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best days of Wintel may be behind them, but tablets - Android, iOS or other - will never be the only solution if they never make it past the 10" mark. Comfort and productivity have to confront portability at some point and the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 does just that.</paragraph>
