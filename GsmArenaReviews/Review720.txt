			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola acquisition will put even more wind in the sail of outward bound Lenovo but blockbuster smartphones carrying their own brand are needed just as much, both at home in China and internationally. The QHD Vibe Z2 Pro is undoubtedly the top-of-the range offering, but what about the midrange? The Lenovo Vibe X2 reporting for duty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe X2 looks stunning in its layered magnesium alloy body and that's exactly the impression Lenovo was after. It's hard to get noticed in this particular segment of the market, but the Vibe X2 has nothing to worry about. The layered design of the Vibe X2 is not unlike the Jolla phone, but there's an extra layer, for a total of three, whose different colors complement each other nicely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the flashy outfit, the Vibe X2 offers equally impressive innards. We are talking one of MediaTek's latest True8core chipsets, where four of the CPU cores are 2GHZ Cortex-A17s. The Vibe X2 offers a solid 5" IPS display of 1080p resolution too. Complete with the 13MP camera at the back, the Vibe X2 is tiptoeing close to premium territory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Chinese phone makers are known for offering more than the usual for the price bracket. Let's see what the Vibe X2 has to say about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only other phone to be powered by this particular MediaTek chipset is the Meizu MX4. Fortunately, unlike most of its compatriots, the Lenovo Vibe X2 is more readily available outside its home market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Riding on charm alone won't take the Vibe X2 too far and Lenovo certainly knows it. The Vibe X2 needs to click with customers on a deeper level and that's always easier said than done. At least on paper though, the phone is more than adequately powered, with things like Cat.4 LTE and 2 gigs of RAM boosting its credentials with users who value performance over looks. The option to layer on accessories is a welcome touch of novelty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coming up next is the usual unboxing and hardware checkup. We'll take the Lenovo Vibe X2 out of the box and see if the handling is as good as the looks. And that's just for starters. Let's go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Generous retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo is absolutely keen on making a great first impression and it all starts with the packaging. We were very pleasantly surprised not only from the looks of the retail box but also with its contents. The Vibe X2 comes bundled with the usual microUSB cable and charges as well as a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there's more to it, as Lenovo has gone an extra step to charm the customer and has thrown in a screen protector as well as a transparent plastic back cover. A SIM ejector is provided as well. While not much, it's certainly more than the majority of manufacturers bundle with their phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looks of the Lenovo Vibe X2 are easily described as flamboyant, but we'll be careless to leave it at this. The phone's design is separated into four distant layers with a bunch of color schemes available. Each layer has its own hue that complements the adjacent ones. It works quite well and, while you'd think that four-layer design would add to the waistline of the phone, it doesn't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 measures 140.2 x 68.6 x 7.3mm and weighs just 120 grams. It's ever so slightly larger than an iPhone 6, but lighter and with a 5" display instead of a 4.7", but more on that later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lightness of the Vibe X2 is due to its magnesium-alloy unibody. It also makes it quite durable, although we hope any potential drop tests are all the phone's drops stay in Lenovo's testing labs. But if you do drop it, you can be fairly confident the unibody build will stay in one piece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make sure this doesn't happen on a regular basis, the Vibe X2's sides are totally flat providing excellent grip. The sides on the back, however, are a tad sharp and can be a bit uncomfortable for some, as they don't rest quite naturally in the hand. That's strictly personal though, as many would certainly like the rugged feel of the non-chamfered edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, all of the sides of the Vibe X2 are totally flat. The colorful look nicely counters the otherwise boxy design of the phone. The rounded top and bottom edges also work positively for offsetting the flat sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Vibe X2 feels nice to the touch and the build quality is impeccable. That's to be expected, since the phone sports a unibody chassis. But there's more to it than that. Lenovo has done a great job of touching up every detail, making the phone's build and materials feel as premium as possible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's start with the front of the Vibe X2. It houses the 5" IPS LCD 1080p display with the usual for the company three capacitive keys below it: Menu, Home and Back. Above the display, there's the earpiece and a 5MP camera to its right. An array of proximity and ambient light sensors is present, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side we find the SIM card tray, which in India only houses two microSIM card slots. It requires a tray pin to eject, but Lenovo supplies one in the box. Sadly, there's no microSD card slot for storage expansion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is a home for the volume rocker and Power/Lock buttons, which are done in a fancy looking metal. The 3.5mm headphone jack is at the top left, while at the bottom, there's the microUSB charging port and microphone hole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vibe X2's back is quite stylish and clean looking - the 13MP camera is on the top left joined by a single LED flash. The secondary microphone for noise cancellation is on its right. Below them is the Lenovo logo and the cutouts for the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting addition to the back are the three pogo pins, which are used for snapping on Lenovo's custom made Xtension accessories. The currently announced Xtensions include a JBL-made external speaker, which also doubles as a kickstand. There's also an external battery pack case for the Vibe X2, which also snaps to the back and uses the pogo pins for the battery juices to flow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no information on the pricing of the Vibe X2 JBL speaker Xtension yet, but the battery pack one is retailing in India for $32 (INR 1,999).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 is built around a 5" IPS LCD display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. This results in a respectable pixel density of 441ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is covered with a protective layer of Gorilla Glass 3 making it resistant to minor scratches. A cool feature is the smart brightness option, which detects any hard lights hitting the display and adjusts the brightness automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The matrix is a standard RGB type with an equally sized red, green and blue pixels. Here's the display matrix of the Lenovo Vibe X2 Pro shot with our digital microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy with the colors that the Vibe X2's display outputs. Its IPS display offers an adequate brightness at both 50% and 100% and more than okay contrast. Viewing angles are also fine with minor shift in contrast and color. You also won't have troubles viewing the display in a sunny weather.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 sports a 2,300mAh battery. It may not offer game changing battery life, but it's still a commendable battery capacity from a phone with a 7.3mm waistline. Still, that's no excuse for Lenovo for not fitting a larger battery, considering its direct competitor, Huawei, has fitted the similarly sized Honor 6 with a 3,100mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With this little rant aside, the phone did okay in our usual battery tests consisting of talk time, video playback, web browsing and stand-by. The phone managed an overall endurance rating of 50 hours, which is adequate, but not impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In regards to power management, it's worth noting that the company has baked in a handy power manager app. It gives you a clear reading of what battery power you have left and an estimation of how much battery life it would provide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also three power profiles you can pick from: normal, power saving and emergency. Power saving mode will block apps running in the background and also downclock the CPU a bit to make the phone more energy-efficient, while still retaining most of its functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emergency mode goes a bit extreme by limiting functionality only to calling and messaging. Anything else on the phone is disabled, allowing it to spread that remaining charge over several hours or even days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature of the Power manager app is the Power saving engine, which optimizes the phone's brightness by something they call "sine wave power-saving technology". Lenovo estimates it can reduce power consumption by 5-30%. There's a similar option for the GPU and its potential power reduction goes as far as 25%. If you want to get even more juice out of the battery, the app allows you to schedule a timed shut down of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe X2 allows you to freeze apps or see a detailed graph of the power consumption. The latter is separated into software and hardware. The software part is akin to the stock Android battery graph, while the hardware shows you how much power the CPU, screen, radio, Wi-Fi and other hardware components draw out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the option to optimize power consumption. The button is located at the bottom and upon pressing it, the app detects what draws the most power and offers you advice on how to go about it. It's clear that Lenovo has turned special attention to getting the most out of the Vibe X2 battery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 comes with truly global quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE and penta-band 3G with HSPA (up to 42Mbps downlink and 5.7Mbps uplink) cellular connectivity. The six-band Cat. 4 LTE support (up to 150Mbps download, and up to 50Mbps uploads) is not the best around, but it still covers plenty of big names in the 4G business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is available in single SIM and Dual SIM configuration. The latter has a dedicated SIM management section in its settings menu and is only available in India for now. It allows you to choose which SIM card is active and the default SIM to use for placing voice calls, data connectivity or messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with DLNA, so you can easily play media (photos, videos, music) from DLNA-enabled storage devices or push content from your phone to a DLNA-compatible TV or music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 4.0 is also on board with A2DP, EDR, and LE. GPS and GLONASS support is enabled. There's an FM radio, but no NFC or Infrared on board.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box complete with Lenovo's thoroughly skinned Vibe 2.0 user interface layer. Lenovo hasn't specified a time frame for a potential firmware update to Android 5.0 Lollipop, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is often the case with Chinese phone makers, we can't help but notice a lot of similarities between the UI skin and Apple's iOS as far as general organization is concerned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, Lenovo's approach is clean and unobtrusive. It features a lot of additions to the stock Android functionality, without making everything too cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out our quick walkthrough of Lenovo's custom Android work in the video below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the lockscreen, it's the standard Android affair displaying a date widget and, depending on the theme you've chosen, up to four shortcuts for the phone dialer, camera and messaging apps. Lenovo has ditched the lockscreen widgets that come stock with Android, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen we find a fairly standard Android homescreen with up to 18 homescreen panes available at your disposal. That's a lot of space, but then again, Lenovo doesn't have a dedicated app drawer, so you might need more of it than you expect. With no app drawer, anything you install pops up on the homescreen, akin to a Xiaomi smartphone, where it coexists with your widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can group the app in folders, which look a lot like the folders on iOS 8. Anyway, a pinch gesture on the homescreen gets you to the management screen - from there, you can rearrange, delete and add panes. That's where you also choose the default homescreen that you go to when you press the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Menu button on the homescreen gives you quick access to themes, wallpapers, desktop settings and screen manager. From here, you can also add and remove widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Theme center allows you to change the look and feel of the user interface. There are several built-in themes, which change the wallpaper, the boot animation, ringtones, user interface elements and app icons. You can also change boot animations and lockscreen styles separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a row of five user-selectable shortcuts and can be expanded by a swipe down to unveil ten more. You can specify their order from the notification bar settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't help but notice that Lenovo hasn't added a dedicated Do Not Disturb mode. Still, there are four customizable audio presets so you can quickly change your ringtone and notification settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, in the Features tab of the Settings menu, there's a bunch of interesting options. There's 3D gestures, which let you remotely control the Vibe X2. You can answer or decline calls by swiping up or down the screen and also control video playback. Micro screen allows you to make the UI more suitable for one handed use by shrinking its size. To enable it, draw the letter C from the top right corner down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long tap on the Menu capacitive key reveals the app switcher. Swiping an app up removes the app from memory and closes it. A slide to the right shows you the available RAM and a button to clean all open apps from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom Lenovo launcher sports a number of features such as wallpaper scrolling and replacing the wallpaper at will. The latter enables you to change the wallpaper from the homescreen by sliding from the top right corner diagonally. Other settings include desktop transition animation as well as backup and restore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a widget is straight out awkward. You have to long tap on one of the four docked app shortcuts on the bottom and then slide up to reveal the widget bar. Then, it's simply a matter of tapping the widget you want to appear after selecting a homescreen with enough free space on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 sports a MediaTek MT6595 chipset with four high-powered Cortex-A17 2.0GHz cores and four low-power Cortex-A7 1.7GHz cores for when you need to conserve battery. The only other phone to tout this chipset is the Meizu MX4, but there, the Cortex-A17 cores are set to run on to 2.2GHz. The RAM is at 2GB and the GPU is the PowerVR G600, so overall, we're looking at a very respectable hardware setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we proceed with the tests, we would like to note that we specifically checked whether the Vibe X2 cheats in the tests and it doesn't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, our first test inspects the raw CPU performance. In the multi-OS GeekBench 3 the Lenovo Vibe X2 tops the chart among its main rivals and also beats the Meizu MX4 by almost 100 points. In the similar AnTuTu 5 benchmark, the Vibe X2 is marginally slower than the Galaxy Alpha and the Meizu MX4.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As mentioned, the Lenovo Vibe X2 employs a PowerVR G600 GPU, but it managed only mediocre 1080p offscreen results in GFXBench's 2.7 T-Rex and 3.0 Manhattan tests. Unsurprisingly, its results are quite close to the Meizu MX4, but since Meizu has opted for a higher clock speed of its chipset components, it offers better results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gaming benchmark Basemark X gives the Vibe X2 a score lower than the Motorola Moto X (2014) and Samsung Galaxy Alpha, but most games will be upscaled anyway. You won't run into any gaming issues with the Vibe X2.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In terms of web browsing, the Lenovo Vibe X2 did a great job at Kraken 1.1 where it beat the Samsung Galaxy Alpha and Xiaomi Mi4 despite running Android 4.4.2 KitKat. It also topped the BrowserMark 2.1 chart, which we're pretty sure is a direct result of Lenovo opting in for the latest version of Chrome.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we are more than happy with the performance of the Lenovo Vibe X2. It's a snappy hardware and it handles the user interface operations and even demanding applications and games quite well. MediaTek has come a long way and we feel the MT6595 chipset with an octa-core CPU is its strongest silicon to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can only assume that if Lenovo updates the Vibe X2 to Android 5.0 Lollipop, we'll not only see a slight boost in performance, but also some nice optimizations resulting in better battery life. Get to work, Lenovo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 comes with a very streamlined phonebook experience. It is laid out across four tabs: dialer, contacts, messaging and favorites. You can view either single contacts or groups as well as blacklist entries. Tapping on a contact brings up a popup with access to a contact's scrollable info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As on most Android launchers, you can assign a plethora of contact information including custom ringtones and images. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for contacts or filter them by their first letter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any issues with the quality of the calls we placed with the Vibe X2. The voice made it crisp and clear to the other end. The proximity sensor makes sure the screen stays off when you hold the phone to your face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone on its face while it's ringing would mute the call ringing. As we already mentioned in the user interface portion of the review, you can also place a 3D gesture to pick up a call, but it didn't work at all during our testing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary noise cancelling on-board microphone ensures a quieter background for your voice while in call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the call log share the same screen. The dialer offers smart dialing and it works both with names and numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Lenovo Vibe X2 through our traditional loudspeaker test and it scored an Average mark, which means you'll have to be alert to have the phone near you if you don't want to miss any calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how it stacks up against the competition:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual with all SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads. Attaching a photo, video, audio recording or the like automatically turns your message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 also comes with Hangouts, which is another way to handle texts. The latest update lets Hangouts integrate your SMS and MMS messages in addition to Gtalk and Google+ conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email, the Gmail app includes the four inbox options (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates) that Google recently introduced in their online interface. The default Email app is similar to Gmail, except that it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes, which is useful for when you want to keep track of multiple accounts from one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 employs the stock Android keyboard, which many users like. It stretches nicely on the 5" display and allows for a really quick typing. You can enhance it even further by turning on the Gesture typing. A cool little feature is that you can use the volume rocker to move the cursor left or right when you're in a text box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of the Vibe X2 has been heavily customized from the stock Android experience. It can either show all of your photos organized by date or a list of your albums. Tapping on a photo shows it in full screen. Sadly, you can't resize thumbnails using the pinch zoom gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another missing feature is any form of gallery sorting. Whereas many rivals allow you to sort by folders, favorites, people faces or location, that's no possible on the Vibe X2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go into a more capable editor with options for light and exposure adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), filters and beauty enhancements (which detects faces automatically).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vibe X2 packs a very capable video player that didn't stutter at playing every video codec we threw at it. It refused to play a video with AC3 audio, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is marginally better than the gallery as it offers a few ways to sort the videos. There's also an editor, which allows you to stitch together a couple of videos. However, there's no subtitle support, which is a pity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player comes with a neat trick allowing you to play the video in a floating window. You can resize it by a pinch zoom gesture, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Music spins up the party<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Believe it or not, Lenovo hasn't bothered making its own Music app and is using the stock Google Play Music one. Not that this is a bad thing, though. It features Listen Now feature, which tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music also gives you the option to upload music onto the Google-branded cloud and stream it on your device via Wi-Fi or mobile data. There's also the nifty option of downloading the content onto the device if you want to have there for connection-less times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several equalizer presets along with a custom user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play around with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 is hardly the most gifted musician around as shown by its performance in our dedicated test. The smartphone posted excellent scores in the part where it works with an active external amplifier, but even then its volume levels were really low so it wasn't all good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones and things start to turn ugly with frequency response and dynamic range taking hits. Meanwhile distortion creeps in and also a fair amount of stereo crosstalk to round up a rather disappointing performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Lenovo Vibe X2 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great 13MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 features a 13MP camera with a maximum resolution of 4160 x 3120 pixels in 4:3 mode. It can also shoot in 16:9, but photos are cropped to 4096 x 2304 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo also boasts about the 5MP front-facing camera of the Vibe X2 with its auto shutter gesture controls. The camera automatically takes a photo when you wave to capture, make the "piece" sign or blink in order to reduce shaking. All of these worked flawlessly during our testing, except for the blink detection, which was hit-and-miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the Vibe X2 camera is friendly and logically laid out. On the top left you get four shortcuts (front camera switch, flash toggle, HDR and shutter trigger). The settings menu is accessed via a dedicated shortcut in the bottom left corner. It gives you access to HDR mode, Auto scene, geo-tagging, resolution settings, anti-banding, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo has provided the basic shooting modes - there's Normal, Panorama and Effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 captures images with plenty of detail. Despite the not-so-favorable shooting conditions, we were pleasantly surprised with its image quality. Colors are accurate as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the time our unit was able to produce good detail and sharp results. Occasionally, some of the photos had some softer spots here and there. Noise levels are a bit high too, but it's tolerable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe X2 was fast to lock onto focus and taking images is fast with great shot to shot times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 managed to get close to subjects and offer detailed macro images. There is a decent separation between object and background creating a slight bokeh effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each manufacturer has their own way of dealing with HDR photography. High dynamic range shots aim to expose both the highlights and the shadows of a scene correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 snaps multiple images with different exposures and merges them to create its HDR shots. Unfortunately, the results are quite subtle and more often than not we preferred the non-HDR versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, we shot our test posters with the Lenovo Vibe X2 and here's how it fared, compared against the LG Nexus 5 and HTC Desire Eye. Of course, our tool allows you to compare it against any other smartphone that we've shot with.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p video is fine, but not awesome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 offers 1080p videos at 30 frames per second in addition to 720p videos, but there's no option for fast- or slow-motion capturing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not a whole lot you can adjust in terms of video settings. You can set the focus to infinite or continuous as well as toggle the digital video stabilization. That's about it, which is quite disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p videos taken with the Lenovo Vibe X2 look good, but are not spectacular in any way. The level of resolved detail is ok, the white balance and colors are fine too. The videos look smooth with a framerate of about 29-30fps. Edge-to-edge sharpness is good, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos have an impressive bitrate of 34Mbps and their stereo audio track in encoded in 128Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some reason the Vibe X2 auto focus system kept constantly hunting front and back while we we were shooting our test scene even though it had focus right most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can check out our video comparison tool to see how the 1080p videos differ in resolution, color rendition and more. You can also compare the Lenovo Vibe X2 to any of the numerous phones and tablets we've tested.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. Chrome received a major update recently, which brought a new UI on board. It is now even more pleasant to look at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with the available settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reduce data usage option does what it says on the tin - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and only then send it to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Incognito tabs let you browse without saving history or cookies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Chrome still doesn't offer a Reading mode like its completion from iOS and Windows Phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo has put a lot of effort in offering added value with its custom UI. One of the cool apps is Security, which performs a check if you have malicious software on your phone or an app has too much access to private information. You can then prevent it from accessing your calls, messages, location and camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of that, you can define parental control access and set up an anti-theft password, in case you lose your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a cool looking File manager. It lets you access internal memory and sorts your files into neat categories. You can perform cut, copy and paste operations, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 comes with the usual set of utility apps such as flashlight, calendar, clock, calculator, recorder, compass and radio apps. Sadly, the FM Radio app doesn't support RDS, but compensates for that with a beautiful UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, as with most Androids out there, there's Google Maps to let you navigate around. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street view mode works especially nice in conjunction with the phone's accelerometer and digital compass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of owning a smartphone is getting new apps, and when it comes to Android, Google Play Store is the best source for getting your fill. From recommendations to top apps, it features a plethora of ways you can find new apps, and installing an app usually only takes a couple of taps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 is a nice break from the monochrome majority of mid-range smartphones that are available today. The colorful highlights are done just right without getting overboard. Many manufacturers aim to charm potential customers with looks, but not many succeed like Lenovo did with the Vibe X2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Complete with the Vibe Z2 Pro, the company has very strong competitors in both the mid-range and the premium segment of the market. And we're glad these aren't just available in China.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similarly to its more upmarket brother, the Vibe X2 is built to last. We're yet to see if the colors will wash away, though. Just kidding, but a water-resistant body would've been the cherry on top of the cake for the Vibe X2, alas it does without this extra protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5" display of 1080p resolution is now par for the course in the upper mid-range market. Lenovo didn't skimp on it and it delivered punchy colors with satisfactory contrast and brightness and great side viewing angles. If there's something not to like about the display, it is the bezels surrounding it. Lenovo could've made the phone slightly more compact by opting for on-screen Android button and a nudge slimmer bezels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, once you fire it up, it becomes apparent the latest MediaTek chipset with eight-core CPU inside means business. The phone is fast and fluid, running the custom Vibe UI 2.0. In a large part of the benchmark tests it even managed to outpace its rivals. Our synthetic benchmarks say that the GPU could have used some more oomph, though we didn't have any issues with any games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speed is one thing, but in some disciplines endurance is more important. Cue in the dirty jokes, but battery life is no funny matter. The 2,300mAh unit inside the Vibe X2 managed an endurance rating of only 50 hours, which is okay, but nothing outstanding. Here's hoping that a potential update to Android 5.0 Lollipop would bring an improvement in that respect. This is a great place to poke Lenovo to shed light on its firmware update plans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper mid-range market is saturated with phones from already familiar manufacturers, so how is Lenovo going to compete? Price-wise, the company is confident in its product and asks around ?400 on average, depending on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first alternatives that come to mind are the refreshed Moto X and Moto G. While again, it would be Lenovo that's pocketing your money, if you get any of these two, they both cost noticeably less than the Vibe X2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto G (2014) costs half as the Vibe X2, but also offers considerably less in return, too. The second-generation Moto G packs a 5" 720p display, Snapdragon 400 chipset and an 8MP snapper. It can be colorful, too, but you do get what you pay for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X (2014) is a bit more expensive and comes with the considerably more powerful Snapdragon 801 and a 13MP camera that can record 4K video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola Moto G (2014) ? Motorola Moto X (2014)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Samsung camp, we find the current flagship Galaxy S5. It costs around the same as the Vibe X2, but mainly in Europe, as in Asia that's not the case. However, the Galaxy S5 offers a ton more. For starters, it packs a faster chipset and its Super AMOLED display is an absolute beast. Moreover, it has a larger battery, expandable storage and an outstanding 16MP camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has upped its game in the mid-range market recently with the addition of the Desire Eye and One (M8) Eye. The Desire Eye is a bit peculiar, as it features two 13MP cameras - one at the front and one at the back. Needless to say, the selfie experience is miles better than what the Vibe X2 offers. In terms of specs, you get a 5" 1080p display with the Desire Eye and a slightly larger 5.2" one with the One (M8 Eye).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Desire Eye ? HTC One (M8 Eye)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to also include the obligatory superstar team of phones from China. Xiaomi, Huawei and Meizu all have their 5" 1080p powerhouses, enjoying tons of interest due to their low prices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All three rock quad-core CPUs, albeit different chipsets and apart from the Meizu MX4 with its 20.7MP camera, the Xiaomi Mi4 and Huawei Honor 6 feature 13MP cameras. Sadly, they're not widely available, so getting one may be tricky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Meizu MX4 ? Xiaomi Mi 4 ? Huawei Honor 6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite recently turning one year old, the LG Nexus 5 is still a very viable alternative to the Vibe X2. It rocks a 5" 1080p display plus an 8MP camera on the back and a snappy Snapdragon 800 chipset with a quad-core Krait 400 CPU. It runs Android 5.0 Lollipop and buying it will ensure you get the latest updates straight from Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Nexus 5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shouldn't forget LG, which offers both the year-old G2 and currently carrying the company's flag the G3. Both offer great bang for the buck, especially the G3. It's currently slightly cheaper than the Vibe X2, again in Europe that is, and trumps it in every way imaginable including processing power, the QHD display and 4K recording camera. The only drawback we can think of is that it's plastic, but at least it's very compact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG G3 ? LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, let's turn our eyes to the Windows Phone team, or the Lumia 930 to be precise. Traditionally, Windows Phone smartphones cost less than their competitors and these two are not an exception. The Lumia 930 features a Snapdragon 800, which runs Windows Phone 8.1 without breaking a sweat. At the back, there's a 20MP camera with Carl Zeiss optics, which performs admirably, as we found in our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 930</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you might have noticed, the Lenovo Vibe X2 puts it in bad company. Its pricing lets it rub shoulders with current flagships on their way to be replaced, and that comparison is not exactly in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the right pricing, we would have had no problems recommending it whole-heartedly. It has a lot going for it and it effortlessly manages to look awesome from any angle.</paragraph>
