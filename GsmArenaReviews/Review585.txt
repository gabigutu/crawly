			<paragraph>The big bro in the Prism family doesn't really need to elbow its way into the spotlight. And, by the way, the two handsets in the Prism pair are nowhere near each other's clone. Nokia 7900 Prism offers features that are nowhere else to be found. It has no intention of bringing phenomenal all-round functionality like Nokia N95 or the HTC TyTn II but the handset surely has a charm of its own. The living wallpapers and the configurable keypad backlighting color can surely get you noticed. Besides, a 16M color OLED display is not something we see every day in mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7900 is a true example of out-of-the-box thinking. It is clearly not the most feature-packed phone on the market but it brings an enviable number of innovations. The main highlight of course is the 16M color OLED display, which is the first in the whole company portfolio, hitting the shelves one month before the second one - 8800 Arte.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The configurable keypad backlighting is also worth noting as something no other phone can get you. The backlighting might not work the most accurate colors but you do not need to be perfect when you are the only one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Prism pair are style-driven handsets, along the lines of the l'Amour collection and the premium 8-series. It is quite hard to determine the key market rivals of Nokia 7900 but, as we see it, Samsung Ultra line and the more looks-centered Sony Ericsson mobiles - for example S500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If OLED screen is what you are looking for than BenQ Siemens S88 and the just released fashion high-fliers Nokia 8800 Arte and Sapphire Arte are your only options. Quite a bunch of clamshells do have of course OLED external displays, including the monstrous Nokia N93.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Within the Nokia portfolio, the 6500 Classic and Slide are another two viable alternatives. The 6500 Classic is already more affordable than the Prism and many claim it looks better, while the Slide offers an incomparably bigger feature load for the same price.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Nokia 7900 is not the most generous around but it won't leave you disappointed. All the essentials are there - a charger, a manual and a quick start guide. In addition, you will find a microUSB cable and a handsfree with remote control. The latter however doesn't have a 3.5 mm audio jack for plugging in another pair of earphones. The final item in the small box is a carrying pouch that we did find really nice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 7900 Prism 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7900 could surely stand up to many of the thin handsets around measuring only 11.3mm in thickness. Its other dimensions are 112 mm of height and 45mm of width, which do place it among the relatively compact models. Nokia 7900 Prism weighs 101 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two color versions of the 7900 Prism. You can get the handset in black with some parts shiny and some opaque. The alternative combo has a sand beige rear panel with a matching D-pad framing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The diamond-like patterns are all over this sleek handset. The neat and almost seamless sides of the body benefit the design tremendously. There are no side controls, and even the splits between panels are almost invisible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Examining the controls on Nokia 7900 Prism is one of the easiest things you can do. The phone has an extremely low number of controls, missing most of the keys and jacks we are used to seeing on other mobiles. In terms of functional elements, the layout is identical to Nokia 6500 classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece is dead center at the top of the phone. Next to it is the ambient light sensor and the 2" display is right below them. The control and navigation buttons and the alphanumeric keypad are joint in unbroken layout beneath the screen. We will pay due attention to the keypad and display a little later in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nothing to note on the sides of the phone, as no controls are located there. The bottom hosts the microphone pinhole, while at the top we find the microUSB slot and the two horseshoe-shaped LEDs. The color of those is also configurable, together with the keypad's backlighting color. They however only work in stand-by mode, serving as an indication for a missed call or received message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside on Nokia 7900 we come upon the 2 megapixel camera, the LED flash and the loudspeaker grill. No lens cover is to be found here and only a slight recess is meant to protect the lens from scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover of Nokia 7900 takes up most of the phone's back side and due to its design you can hardly guess where its borders lie. Opening it reveals the BL-6P battery and the SIM slot. With the cover removed, the phone looks identical to Nokia 6500 classic. The battery is also the same, though Nokia has quoted lower readings - 3 hours of talk time and 240 hours of stand-by, as opposed to 5 and a half hours of talk time and 300 hours of stand-by in the Classic. The OLED technology is supposed to be more energy-efficient and the difference could be attributed to the light effects of the horseshoe LEDs on top. In reality Nokia 7900 was able to last for about 4 days of light use (a few calls a day, and about 40 minutes of using the other features of the handset).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarming thing here is that the battery cover - really tight at first and quite hard to open - soon became too loose. After only a week of use it was very easy to open single-handedly and we can't help but wonder if things will continue to deteriorate to the point of the panel sliding out by itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, we are very pleased with the construction quality of Nokia 7900 - it is obvious that materials of significantly higher quality have been used in comparison to the Nokia 7500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, we are quite reserved about the way the phone feels in hand. It is rather slippery and, as we see it, overly easy to drop. The plastic surfaces do not provide the best grip, so if you are not the most careful of users your handset could be slipping off your fingers ever too often.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Nokia 7900 sure isn't the most comfortable around. The keys are utterly flat and it's generally difficult to find the borders between them by touch only. Furthermore, due to the unusual layout attempting to press the "1" and "3" keys often results in a miss and you press the hard surface next to them instead. This is probably not too hard to get used to but we would have preferred if we didn't have to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad on the other hand is praiseworthy and so are the surrounding controls. They are all large enough and easy to press. The diamond-shape D-pad is quite comfortable, as the directions are clear-cut and wrong presses are out of question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that deserves admiration is the backlighting and we don't mean the fact that it is even and strong. We mean that is color-configurable according to your taste. You can pick between 49 different colors for the keys and the light effects of the horseshoe LEDs on the top of the body. The colors are not very precisely rendered, but an option like this is something we see for the first time ever since we archived the Ericsson R600, which offered a choice of three backlighting colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Changing the keypad backlighting color</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The light effects are in the same color as the keypad backlighting</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of Nokia 7900 is surely one of its most discussed features. The OLED technology has both its positives and downsides. It involves lower production costs and better power efficiency. The screens are thinner, easier to make and offer a far greater viewing angle, brighter and more contrasty image and faster response time. The thinness and low consumption make OLED screens especially suitable for portable devices. Although, already probing the TV display territory, the OLED technology is still far from full swing and the reason is the still inferior lifetime of OLED materials. However as it seems the Organic LED technology will be replacing the LCD one in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that said, one thing is nudging us about the Nokia 7900 Prism display. How impressed you are with the picture quality largely depends on the environment, in which you're using the phone. Indoors the display has incredible image quality with true black color, which is way beyond the powers of any TFT LCD screen. When exposed to direct sunlight however, the display is totally illegible, making the phone almost impossible to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another flaw of the display is its size. For a phone in this price range we find 2" inadequate, OLED or else. Then, on a second thought, the luxurious Arte has the same screen size and - by far - a juicier price tag.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might have guessed, signal reception and call clarity have not been compromised in Nokia 7900 Prism. The calls are loud and clear on both ends and you will have no problems communicating with this phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the lack of video calls can be considered a real disappointment. With 3G on board, we can't help but wonder why Nokia missed including it. Not that video calling is that frequently used but it wouldn't hurt having it. The Nokia 6233 for example didn't have a video calls camera; however it allowed making video calls with the primary one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how Nokia 7900 ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. It is surely not the loudest phone around but still you won't miss an incoming call or message on most cases. You can find more info about our test, as well as results from other tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Series 40, 5th edition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7900 brings no surprises in terms of user interface. It employs Series 40 5th edition user interface. Navigating and controlling the phone are almost the same as with the previous UI edition and identical to the "quirky sibling" - Nokia 7500. The phone still offers a vast number of configurable options but at the cost of a little complicated menu structure and navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When in stand-by, the display as usually visualizes the pre-selected wallpaper plus signal strength, battery status and time in the top bar. Beneath the top bar are the operator logo and the date. The bottom bar is reserved for the labels of the functions assigned to the center of the navigation key and the two context keys. The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The font on the main display can be of any color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also turn on active standby if you want. It consists of several parts that can be edited or relocated according to the user's preferences. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions indicated by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very bottom are displayed events from the calendar set for the current day. A cool feature here, that even Nokia smartphones do not have, is the possibility to add a note to the active stand-by. The two soft keys' functionality can also be altered if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu in Nokia 7900 can be visualized in four different ways: a grid of icons with or without captions, a list of items, and tabs. While each of them has its pros and cons our personal choice remains the typical grid view with legends. If you prefer more icons to appear simultaneously, you can go for the grid view without text, as it displays a 4 x 3 icons grid. The icons of the main menu can be freely reordered to suit the user's taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The submenus follow no consistent pattern. Some items have captions, others do not. In certain cases, you will even be able to see the selected item described in small font, so you will not need to step further into another menu level. As usual, the menu items are intuitively accessible through keypad shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color background of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper on the display, can be easily modified by applying one of the pre-installed themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu responds quickly, without lagging or holdups. We wouldn't expect anything else from a Series 40 device anyway. Also, we didn't experience any halts or unexpected restarts for the time of our review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Personalization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having in mind that looks are among Nokia 7900 Prism's strong points, it is very important that the themes are suiting the design well. Luckily, this is just the case with all the 11 preinstalled themes on the handset. Coming in respectable count by all means, all themes are fine-looking and provide the perfect finish to the handset's appearance. Naturally, you can also download additional themes for your Nokia 7900 Prism. Nokia 7900 offers remarkable personalization trough the available light effects and color customization, along with the living wallpaper support. You can change the keypad lighting color choosing among 49 available tints, and the pulsating top lights and the startup and shutdown animations will follow suit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five predefined ringing profiles on Nokia 7900, plus a Flight mode, which turns off all transceivers on the phone. This can turn out very convenient if you decide to use your phone as an MP3 player for example. Furthermore, the flight mode can be used without a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Nokia 7900 is on a very high level offering space for up to 1000 contacts and extensive configuration options. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringtones can be assigned to each contact. Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. The picture displayed is different for incoming and outgoing calls, as it fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and only take a small part of it when you are calling one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contacts list: List-of-Names, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Picture. It can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at the same time. The phonebook font size can also be enlarged, facilitating work with the phone for people with sight problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is done by gradual typing of the name of the corresponding contact. And that's not all: contacts can also be organized in groups and these can consequently be used as call filters. Another praiseworthy application is the voice dial, which requires no pre-recording of the commands and phonebook names. It is even equipped with a training application that helps for better results when using voice commands and/or dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 7900 won't surprise anyone who has ever held a Series 40 device in their hands. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them together. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The message menu of Nokia 7900 is organized almost perfectly. Besides standard text messages, the handset is capable of receiving and sending multimedia messages, audio and flash messages via MMS, and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do in order to turn a regular SMS into an MMS is insert a picture or any other multimedia content. As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can insert through standard typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with the most recent addressees in the call register. There is even the very handy option to set a contact as favorite for messaging in case you have frequent correspondence with one and the same person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and is organized in a practical time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. It goes without saying that the phone also offers a rich T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will be divided into constantly visible. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS. MMS size limit for both send and receive is 300 KB. The best part is that the phone will automatically scale down pictures for sending via MMS. The email client is really top-notch. It automatically adjusts its settings once you enter your email address and than all you need to do is enter your username and password. No more time wasted on trying to get a long list of settings right for the client to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email boxes. When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Sent attachments are not limited in size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client downloads the headers and then offers to download the entire body of the messages you need. You can also set the messages to be automatically downloaded in full if traffic is no problem for you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is really nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is a slightly upgraded version of the one used in the Nokia 6500 classic. It has improved looks with a new theme added but otherwise is not different in terms of functionality. Besides managing all the typical functions of a music player, it also sorts songs by artist, album and genre.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player works with MP3, MIDI, AAC, AAC+, and WMA formats. The supported A2DP profile allows listening on Bluetooth wireless earphones. The player is highly customizable through a number of themes that are at your disposal. These were all quite eye pleasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the retail package you will find a wired headset. There is very little chance that you will fall in love with it but if you use your player rather rarely however, and do not expect wonders from your headset, it may just do the job. The handset features a microUSB jack for connecting the headset, so using another set of headphones may just turn out impossible, unless you manage to somehow find a suitable adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sonic experience of the player is enhanced by an equalizer and a stereo expansion function. The equalizers do deserve attention, as they perform very well and have nice graphic visualization. Nokia 7900 has only one loudspeaker located on the rear, right next to the camera. We did already mention that we weren't impressed by its performance at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, on the positive side, we have to mention that it does not get muffled at all when the phone body is placed on its back on an even surface such as a desk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no FM radio on Nokia 7900; the other Prism does have one. So if you get bored with the music player all you can do is turn the video on. The video player is compatible with the 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The possibility to remove the soft key captions to make better use of the full screen view mode is nice and generally improves video watching.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We personally aren't great fans of how the gallery looks in Series 40 models but, as it's used as a file manager at the same time, we will be lenient. For example you do need a few extra presses to get to your music files, as there is no file filtering. The Gallery relies on your putting the right type of files in the right folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is not the fastest thing around and doesn't allow a picture to be zoomed in too closely, so actually it is not much of a help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pictures can also be viewed in fullscreen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter however offers very limited options, but considering the fact that there are very few users that actually use a picture editor on their phones, this is understandable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search options. The latter is quite convenient for finding a specific file in overfed folders but we still believe that gallery on Series 40 could be improved a lot. That goes true especially in user friendliness and we do hope that sometime in the future the file manager and the gallery of these phones will be separate applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Another mediocre camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7900 is armed with a 2 megapixel camera with image resolution of up to 1600 x 1200 pixels. Typical of Series 40, camera settings are not the richest you can imagine, but with this shooter they are more than enough. They include white balance settings, three quality settings going form basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flash can be forced to on, regardless of the light conditions, and used as fill flash. Naturally, an automatic mode for the LED is also available. In terms of performance however, we weren't impressed at all with its performance. It is probably a little better than the LED flash we found on the Nokia 7500 Prism but still fails to achieve decent quality pictures on most occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera itself is not the best we have seen either. Frankly, it is not even near average level. It has no lens cover and is only a little recessed to avoid scratches. We have already mentioned that this seems not quite enough for us but we can't do anything about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of a dedicated button is another real downer when it comes to operating the camera. It is quite uncomfortable, especially when shooting in landscape mode, to use the confirm button of the D-pad for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo quality is about average for a 2 megapixel camera; in favorable weather decent images can be produced, sharp enough, with less artifacts and more precise colors. Noise levels are high in areas with no detail like the sky for example. Given the absence of autofocus, you'd rather not take a picture of a closely situated objects or text, as they will surely be blurred. If you want to have any chance of reading captured text, the photo has to be taken from a distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, a few words about the camera speed. Nokia 7900 is not nearly as slow as Nokia 5310 in that aspect but still not the snappiest around. It won't take ages to save a picture but you cannot expect that to happen in a blink of an eye either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another disappointment is the QCIF video capture resolution of the Nokia 7900's camera. Inadequate is the mildest we can call it, as video clips made in that resolution are by no means usable. The fact that the length of videos in 3GP format is only limited by the free memory available comes as little consolation. Zooming is also available but that cannot stop us from calling the video capturing a sounding failure. It is even worse than the still camera performance for that matter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: USB in focus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is another aspect of Nokia 7900 where more can be demanded. The main focus here is the USB connectivity and it is really seamless. Upon connection of the USB cable, it prompts you to select the connection mode. You can then alternate these modes by only a few keypresses. Moreover, Mass storage is available, allowing your phone's memory to be directly accessed from a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand the microUSB is not as widespread as the miniUSB, but as it seems, we'll be getting more and more of it. The Bluetooth version is 2.0 and it supports the A2DP profile, which allows stereo wireless connection. The rest of the connectivity options include the network support - luckily Nokia 7900 Prism supports 3G for faster data transfers, as well as EDGE and GPRS where 3G support is missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no infrared port on the device and no memory card slot, which can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring information.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7900 has an integrated WAP browser, which also manages HTML pages. No changes in functionality have been made and it is identical to the one used in Nokia 7500. Font size modifications are available, as usual. When set at the smallest font, the display visualizes up to 11 text lines. Direct address entering is available too. The browsing experience with this application however is nowhere near the standard set by the browsers in Nokia's smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser faces serious competition from another brilliant application - the famous Opera Mini Java application. The latter is pre-installed and is definitely our first choice for browsing the web on Nokia 7900. It is far more intuitive and fits text better than the integrated browser. The browsing experience is at a significantly better level with the Opera application. We nonetheless couldn't help wishing the screen was larger on this occasion.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer: time-proven performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of Nokia 7900 is at a very high level, which is to be expected in a S40 device. Month, week, and day views are available for the calendar. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are five types of events: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Further, each type of event has its own specific fields like start and end time, type of alert with various advance intervals, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a handy to-do manager that enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. They are easily synced with the calendar application. Text notes are available as well; their length is limited to 3000 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute length limit, stopwatch, countdown timer and a calculator. They are all easily operable and decently looking. This time however, the calculator offers two different versions - a standard easier to use one and a scientific version with far more functions available. An elaborate loan calculator is also at the user's disposal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 7900 comes with a relatively small number of preinstalled applications outside the organizer. The unit converter application has been dropped and so has been the size converter. Luckily, the Sensor application is onboard providing Bluetooth communication. It allows the user to detect other users who are in the vicinity and to exchange messages with them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other included application is the world clock, which allows checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, the applications that complete the content on Nokia 7900 are the internet-based Yahoo search and Yahoo Go, as well as Download applications. While the first greatly facilitates the access to the popular search engine, the latter connects you directly to Nokia's download center, where you can find a lot of downloadable content for you phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yahoo Go application deserves some special attention as it gives the user instant access to the most popular services offered by Yahoo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming lovers will probably appreciate the preinstalled content, as it includes four games. The first one is Golf Tour and is a decent implementation of the popular game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music Guess game tests your ability to recognize songs by listening to small parts of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final two games in line are a version of Nokia's all times favorite Snake (in this case Snake III) and a nice rendition of the popular Japanese game Sudoku. All the games have decent graphics and are comparatively easy to play. Leaving the imperfect keypad aside that is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion: when you want to be unique<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Summarizing our experience with Nokia 7900 we have to say that this attractive handset offered quite pleasing performance. It was fun to use and provided very good user experience in most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it is a complicated question whether and how worth it is to purchase. Having in mind the hefty price tag of the Prism, we cannot overlook the fact that Nokia 6500 slide would be a much more reasonable buy in terms of value for money. Though the Prism's exotic exterior and playful lights stand little comparison to the solid conservatism of the slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, if looks are what you're after Nokia 6500 classic seems a viable alternative with its seamless case of anodized aluminum. For the record, the price of the Classic is now quite lower than that of the Prism.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Nokia 7900 has a strong enough point - the unique features. It's got what it takes to stand out in a crowd, and that might be more than enough for quite a number of people.</paragraph>
