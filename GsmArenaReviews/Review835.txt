			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 is the sequel to the ultra-thin P6, the phone that proved, beyond any doubt, Huawei's ability to create visually appealing handsets. The new model builds on the original with a 5" 1080p screen, superior camera and chipset, plus a number of other improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The defining feature of the Ascend P6 was the 6.2mm thin body (touted as "the thinnest smartphone") and a faux metal back. The new Ascend P7 can claim neither of those things as it's thicker (7.1mm) and has a glass-covered back. But what a double textured finish indeed! One to fall in love with!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is metal framing, and the whole thing is sandwiched between two layers of Gorilla Glass 3 - especially welcome on the front, where the new 5" IPS screen of 1080p resolution is well worth protecting. Even without having the P6 and P7 side by side, we instantly appreciated the extra clarity afforded by the higher pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enough teasing the new specs, here are the other ups (and downs) of the Huawei Ascend P7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P7 takes photography seriously, especially selfies. The front-facing camera has an 8MP BSI sensor and features modes like face enhancement and selfie panorama. The camera on the back is sourced from Sony and is a 13MP shooter with 1080p video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has also popped in a new chipset that brings more processing power and LTE support. Another plus is that the company claims to have fixed the overheating issues thanks to a more advanced manufacturing process. The phone comes with Android 4.4.2 KitKat with the most recent Emotion UI, while its P6 predecessor is still on Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new chipset is still based on Cortex-A9, which is normally a notch below Qualcomm's Krait-based offerings, never mind the higher clock speed in the P7. Having seen the four Cortex-A7s do well enough in the Moto G though, we shouldn't be quick to judge on core architecture alone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us through the next pages where we explore the Huawei Ascend P7 in detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Huawei Ascend P7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 comes in a flat box with a 1A compact charger, a microUSB cable and a one-piece headset. We were pleasantly surprised to find two NFC tags in the box - a blue and a red one - with a quality metallic feel to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rubber case that came with the P6 is no longer supplied, but the new phone comes with a pre-applied screen protector.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 measures 139.8 x 68.8 x 6.5mm. That's 7mm taller and 3.3mm wider than its predecessor. The increase in the vertical and horizontal dimensions can be attributed to the larger screen (going from 4.7" to 5"), though the extra thickness was a bit of a disappointment - razor thin was the calling card of the Ascend P6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Predictably, weight has gone up too, but by a mere 4g to 124g. That's still fairly light for a 5" phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 could be mistaken for the P6 by untrained eyes as the design of both phones are nearly identical. The dead giveaway is the back - gone are the brushed metal looks (the material was good-quality plastic, not actual metal), replaced by Gorilla Glass 3 laying on top of plastic with a radial groove pattern, tiny dots adding extra texture. This combo looks stunning, especially under the light-reflecting glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the device are still flat, for a decisively angular look and feel, sturdy metal exposed top, left and right. The bottom is rounded and made of plastic (not our favorite type of plastic for what it's worth).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as expected, the unibody design has ruled out a user-replaceable battery. This means the microSIM and microSD slots are on the sides of the phone but, this time around, the eject pin is a separate tool, not doubling as a 3.5mm cork as in the Ascend P6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With this double-glass unibody and aluminum sides the Ascend P7, just like its predecessor, suspiciously reminds of the old generation of iPhones (4/4S). We don't mind the similarities, as the combination of materials has already proven popular and the P7 looks classy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handling of the Huawei Ascend P7 is excellent for a device this size. The Lock key and the volume rocker fit nicely under your right thumb, and while the back may be slippery, the metal sides offer enough grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It isn't the easiest smartphone to operate single-handedly, nor is it exceptionally pocket-friendly. But being lightweight and super slim, the Huawei P7 is easily among the less cumbersome of five inchers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 introduces a brand new IPS display of 1080p resolution. This works out to an excellent pixel density of 455ppi, which is among the best in the 1080p class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display offers really wide viewing angles with minimum color distortion. The colors are great, the blacks are quite deep and the contrast is excellent too. We are very pleased with Huawei's latest display and image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen glass is reflective and the sunlight legibility, while not great, is still decent and you won't have much trouble operating even under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 also offers the rare option to adjust the screen's color temperature. It's a slider that gives you control on whether the screen has a cooler or warmer (blue vs. amber) tint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei Ascend P7 uses standard RGB matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Backlight is also available - it assures the automatic brightness control doesn't do rapid jumps when adjusting the illumination level. If switched on, the Ascend P&amp; will calculate the next light transition point in a bright lighting environment and maintain a gradient brightness variation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Huawei Ascend P7 also supports Gloves Mode - once enabled you can operate the screen with gloves, but this mode will also reduce the battery life.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is what must be the highest resolution front-facing camera yet - an 8MP shooter with a Back Side Illuminated sensor, face enhancement and dedicated panorama mode. The earpiece and a couple of sensors are also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides are still flat with a nice metallic feel to them. The right side has been redesigned slightly, the power button is now round and has moved between the volume rocker and the card slots. The top slot is for microSD cards, while the bottom one accepts microSIMs. There is nothing on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another change is that the 3.5mm audio jack has moved to the top and is no longer plugged by an eject tool. That tool was quite helpful as it was needed to open both card slots and protected the audio jack from dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary microphone for noise cancellation and stereo video recording is right next to the audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Across at the bottom lie the primary microphone and the microUSB port used for charging, PC connections or USB OTG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13 megapixel camera lens is placed in the top left corner of phone's back. The single-LED flash is next to it too. The aluminum loudspeaker grille is in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch the rear camera while the screen is locked and immediately take a picture by double-clicking the volume down key. The whole process from launch to snapping a picture is done lightning fast at 1.3s. We've tried it by ourselves a few times and it is indeed quite handy, but you should point the phone right where you want to shoot and then hit the shortcut. Also we noticed sometimes the camera fails to focus because of the super-fast capturing. Hopefully Huawei will tweak this feature further before the official launch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei Ascend P7 comes with a 2,500 mAh non-removable Li-Po battery. It is officially quoted at up to 14 hours of 3G talk-time or 422 hours of 3G stand-by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional battery test and the results are in. The Ascend P7 pulled an overall rating of 53 hours. The 53-hour rating means the Ascend P7 will last two and a little over two days on a full charge with an hour each of calling, browsing and watching video daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a more detailed breakdown of the Huawei Ascend P7 battery performance check out our blogpost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface powered by Emotion UI v2.3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the software department, Huawei has equipped the Ascend P7 with Android 4.4.2 KitKat, skinned with an updated version of their home-brewed Emotion UI v2.3. The result is a very simple, flat interface with no app drawer (think iOS style).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already seen this software combo in action on the Ascend P6, although here a much smoother interface with redone icons and a boatload of extras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've shot a quick video of the user interface in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default lockscreen has been redesigned and features a nifty "sunshine" effect as you drag your finger across. You customize it to display various wallpapers, widgets, iOS-style shortcuts, and even dual clocks when roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen we find a fairly standard Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts (expandable to five), which are docked at the bottom and are visible on all homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are nine homescreen panes at most - and at least a couple of them will be populated by the preinstalled apps. In the absence of an app drawer, anything you install pops up on the homescreen, just as it would on an iPhone. While this means that you don't have to bother creating shortcuts to your apps on the homescreens, it also means that you cannot effectively hide any of your installed apps either. You can, however, group them into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch on the homescreen triggers the familiar Overview mode to let you check out and organize the homescreen panes currently in use, remove or add panes as you please. Widgets are available too - it's mostly the stock Android ones, but Huawei has thrown in some of its own as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are available as well. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system icons, system font and the sound profile. You can also adjust things like homescreen transition effects, and even change your wallpapers at random or specific time intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Simple homescreen mode that provides an enlarged, simple-to-use interface that's perfect for users who find the default menus too small or confusing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features five toggles at the top, which can be expanded to show all 15 available. You can swap around the ones you want visible on the top row, or you can disable them altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Manager feature that we first saw with Ascend's Mate phablet has been updated with the P7. It shows the time left on your battery (or how much time you need to fully charge it when plugged in), as well as three non-customizable power modes - Smart, Normal and Ultra performance. You can configure which apps are allowed to run in the background, which ones run on startup, and even your battery consumption divided by hardware and software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a Gloves mode toggle in the Settings menu, which will increase the touchscreen sensitivity of the Ascend P7 display, but may reduce your battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The P7 features a task switcher that lets you swipe away unwanted apps, and there's a "Kill all" button that also informs you how much memory you've freed up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P7 is powered by Huawei's own HiSilicon Kirin 910T chipset. The 910T utilizes four 1.8GHz Cortex-A9 cores, a Mali-450 MP GPU, 2GB of RAM, and has an integrated LTE modem. The Cortex A9 cores are already a dated piece of tech, but the quad-core setup should theoretically be quite capable of keeping Android running smoothly, even on a 1080p screen. Huawei has used a 28nm manufacturing process for the chipset and thus it runs noticeable cooler than their HiSilicon K3V2 chipset used in the Ascend P6. The Ascend P6 was notorious for easily overheating under load but this time around this has been taken care of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With thermal performance out of the way, all that is left is to see the chipset fares in terms of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with the CPU benchmarks, the Ascend P7 posted some mid-range numbers, quite expected for this processor. The single-core performance is slightly better when compared to other Cortex-A9-powered devices such as the Galaxy Note II</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P7 posted excellent results on the multi-core GeekBench 3 cross-platform benchmark. The score might not be among the best of the best, but the Ascend P7 manages to beat most of the quad-core Krait and Krait 300 performers, which is quite impressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant and AnTuTu are compound benchmarks which also take into account RAM and GPU performance. Quadrant's score is rather unimpressive, while AnTuTu's numbers are quite good, once again on par with the quad-core Krait and Krait 300 smartphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics benchmark results didn't come out that hot though. The GFXBench tests - both off-screen and on-screen variants - reflected some very poor performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing shows the Huawei Ascend P7 does OK on the JavaScript SunSpider test and very good on the compound BrowserMark benchmark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Kirin 910T chipset turned out quite capable, even exceeding our initial expectations. The Huawei Ascend P7 turned out to be not the underperformer we've been ready to meet, but a snappy and capable device. The chipset, though based on an old technology, is still performing very well in gaming, heavy workflow and web browsing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P7 phonebook is laid out across three tabs that can be navigated by swipes. An alphabetical list on the right can help you jump to a specific letter or you can just use the search function. Tapping on a contact image brings up a tabbed popup, that'll contain additional tabs if the contact has more information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As on most Android launchers, you can assign a plethora of contact information including custom ringtones and images. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is excellent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P7 held on to signal and in-call sound was just fine. The proximity sensor makes sure the screen stays off when you hold the phone to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone on its face while it's ringing would mute the call ringing. Alternatively, picking the phone to your ear while it's ringing, automatically answers the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary noise cancelling on-board microphone ensures a quieter background for your voice while in call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the call log share the same screen. The dialer offers smart dialing and it works both with names and numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Ascend P7 through our traditional loudspeaker test and unfortunately, it only managed a Below Average score, which means you'll likely have a hard time hearing it in noisy environments. Here's how it stacks up to the competition:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual with all SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads. Attaching a photo, video, audio recording or the like automatically turns your message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P7 also comes with Hangouts, which is another way to handle texts. The latest update lets Hangouts integrate your SMS and MMS messages in addition to Gtalk and Google+ conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email, the Gmail app includes the four inbox options (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates) that Google recently introduced in their online interface. The default Email app is similar to Gmail, except that it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes, which is useful for when you want to keep track of multiple accounts from one place. Huawei have incorporated more elements from the Gmail app than most manufacturers, so it's an excellent alternative if you need to keep connected several email accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P7 keyboard features some additional settings thanks to its Swype integration, including themes, split keyboard modes, and keyboard height, but sadly many of them are hidden within the input settings menu rather than as shortcuts from the keyboard like on most interfaces. Still, there is support for gestures as well as integration of Google's voice typing with their downloadable language packs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery includes a great editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P7's gallery app hasn't seen much change since the Jelly Bean version. As there is no dedicated video player, it's also used to play videos. It defaults to the standard Album view, where you see all of your media divided by albums. Video files are signified by a special icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening a single image lets you quickly delete or rotate it, as well as gives you some basic sharing options (including streaming it over DLNA).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go into a more capable editor, which is one of the most full-featured we've seen. Huawei did a great job including light and exposure adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). You can also write on images, add borders, and even adjust advanced photo manipulation settings like curves for individual color channels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it came to playing videos, the codec support was a mixed bag. On the upside you get DivX, MKV and FullHD support, as well as MOV files (a rarity for Android devices), but on the downside video files with AC3 audio refused to play, and we also had issues with WMV files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitle support was also iffy, as foreign language subtitles showed odd characters, and you couldn't choose from a selection of subtitles to play if you had more than one - it just launched the first subtitle file it came across in the same directory as the movie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, all you really get in terms of options is play/pause and a slider to scrub through the video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Dolby Mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 comes with Huawei's custom music player app we saw for the first time on the Ascend P6. It offers four default playlists dedicated to your mood, but you'll have to assign songs to the mood playlists manually. There are also All songs, Playlists, Albums, Artist and Folders views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen is pretty standard, it offers album art and lyrics, and quick shortcuts to add a particular song to one of your mood playlists. You can toggle Dolby Mobile by tapping the icon on the top right, but there are no additional equalizer presets or custom equalizer settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Playing a song results in quick controls on the lockscreen and in the notification area.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 has a built-in FM receiver. It can play through the headset or the loudspeaker, but you'll need to have the headset plugged in as it serves as an antenna. We were disappointed not to find RDS support - you'll have to name your radio stations by hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio quality, let down by stereo crosstalk<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 absolutely aced the first part of our audio quality test. It got an excellent score in every part and got decently high volume levels for a great overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, for the most part, things remain just as impressive when you plug in a pair of headphones. The frequency response is spot on, the noise level and dynamic range are great and there is no distortion to speak of. Yet there's an increase in stereo crosstalk that's too big to ignore and that prevents us from giving the Ascend P7 full marks here. Had it not been for that, the P7 would have been among the best in business, but as things stand now, it's yet another good-to-very-good music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent 13MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 has a 13MP camera for maximum image resolution of 4160 x 3120 pixels. There's a single LED flash to go with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is a standard affair - you get a still/video camera toggle, a virtual shutter and a shortcut to the gallery on the right. On the left side is an advanced menu where you can choose from different shooting modes, and adjust things like object tracking, smile shutter, touch to capture switch, geo-tagging on/off, ISO, white balance, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 camera captures really decent photos, but the camera is not without its flaws.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the sensor is able to hit an accurate exposure reading, the dynamic range is respectable with only small amounts of overblown highlights and dark shadows. Unfortunately, getting an accurate exposure in high contrast situations was hit or miss. Often we had to use touch focus on an unrelated subject in the scene to get accurate tonal characteristics and balanced exposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another point to make is that the photos have more noise than those by competing 13MP cameraphones and the noise reduction is not as mature as we've seen elsewhere (Oppo Find 7a). On a positive note, it's still relatively light and doesn't smear the fine details on uniformly colored and textured surfaces (Galaxy S4).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera module itself has a high detail resolving power and that, coupled with a noticeable tendency of overshaprening the images, delivers visually sharp photos, which we bet will make most users happy. That's especially true when sharing on social networks where photos never get posted in full resolution. But to our discerning eye, at 1:1 magnification the combination of the immature noise suppression and oversharpening adds for an unnatural look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another downside is the uneven sharpness (the soft right edge is most noticeable), which suggests an inferior lens has been used. Of course, you have got to remember this is a pre-release unit we are reviewing here, so we are ready to give it the benefit of a doubt as far as lens quality is concerned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P7 is capable of taking 360-degree panorama shots, which turn out well only moderate glitches in the stitching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei's front-facing camera snaps fixed-focus 8MP photos. It sounds like a selfie machine and even has a special Beauty shot mode (skin smoothing effect) and Instagram-like color effects too. Huawei has even incorporated a Panorama mode for the front facing camera, although it's rather impractical for group selfies. Still, we find the 5MP front camera on the recently reviewed Oppo Find 7a to produce higher quality photos than the Huawei Ascend P7 (at least in good light where we tested).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here some 8MP shots snapped with the front-facing camera.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FullHD camcorder offers standard performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is practically identical to that of the still camera. Both the rear 13MP and front-facing 8MP shooters record videos at up to 1080p@30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored as MP4 files and have a bitrate of a solid 25Mbps for 1080p resolution. There's stereo sound at 96Kbps and the 30fps mark doesn't waver at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is nothing spcecatular. In fact it looks much the same as the one of the Ascend P6, with some added oversharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the generally accurate exposure and contrast, the videos had very poor dynamic range with some very dark shadows and overblown highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The corner softness is more evident in the videos compared to the photos (look to the right edge of the frame). Other than that, the framerate is smooth and the motion is fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are is a 1080p video sample, which we've uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 comes with 2G/GPRS/EDGE and 3G network support. 3G comes with HSPA+ - for up to 42Mbps downlink and 5.7Mbps uplink. Then, there is also the latest LTE (Cat. 4, 150Mbps down / 50Mbps up) network connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA, so you can easily play media (photos, videos, music) from DLNA-enabled storage devices or push content from your phone to a DLNA TV or multimedia player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also NFC support, and the Magic Tag lets you program the two NFC tags which were included in the retail package of the Ascend P7. You can set your tags to do all sorts of actions, including adjust sound levels, activate Do Not Disturb, launch apps, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend P7 also supports USB host so you can attach USB flash drives or connect mice/keyboards.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great web browser experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most droids nowadays, the Ascend P7 comes with two browsers to handle your web surfing needs. The stock browser offers largely the same functionality as Google's bundled Chrome browser, but we found the latter to be a more capable performer. Chrome also lets you sign in with your Google account and access open tabs and history from other sessions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the highlight of Huawei's homebrewed apps is the Phone Manager. It lets you control all sorts of features from call privacy and Do Not Disturb settings, to phone optimization and app permissions, to network and battery usage. It features a one-touch optimization feature that frees up memory space and gives you settings recommendations for maximum battery performance. It's quite a slick feature that few manufacturers offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 comes with Polaris Office 4.0, which handles document editing with ease. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs (both the 2003 and 2007 versions), it also opens PDF files and it doubles as a file explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a proper file explorer too - it has two tabs that divide your content between categories and a file explorer for internal and external storage. The app also handles ZIP and supports batch operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has included some nifty camera features in the Ascend P7, some of which are accessed as individual apps. The Magnifier is especially nifty for looking at stuff up close, while the markedly female-targeted Mirror apps lets you get a quick look at yourself, with included brightness adjustments and zoom options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also the standard sound recorder, flashlight, calculator, calendar, clock, and weather apps, among others, that are a given in any self-respecting Android package nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to getting around, the Ascend P7 comes with Google Maps and Navigation. The app offers much of the same functionality as its web-based counterpart, although you will need a data connection to take full advantage of the navigation features. Street view mode with digital compass enabled is an especially cool trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of owning a smartphone is getting new apps, and when it comes to Android, Google Play Store is the best source for getting your fill. From recommendations to top apps, it features a plethora of ways you can find new apps, and installing an app usually only takes a couple of taps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It was probably the P6 that put Huawei on many people's map, but the Ascend P7 intends to make the brand a fixture in the mobile industry. Ours is of course a mostly Western perspective as Huawei is already extremely popular in its home market and Southeast Asia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 surely does at least one thing right - stand out visually in the Android crowd. Even though that comes at the expense of being called an iPhone copycat - both in terms of looks and UI logic - we are sure this would eventually work out in their favor. Here's hoping Apple doesn't go after them, after it's finished its patent wars with Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company missed a crucial component of the mix, which makes a proper flagship - a top-of-the-line chipset. This has led to relatively poor benchmark scores, but at least Huawei's own chipset finally gets along with Android 4.4.2 KitKat. Built on a 28nm manufacturing process, the new chipset does away with the overheating woes of the one, found in the Ascend P6. The HiSilicon Kirin 910T chipset also enables LTE connectivity (Cat. 4, 150Mbps down / 50Mbps up).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P7 also bumps up the screen size and resolution to put it on par with the likes of the HTC One (M8) and Galaxy S5 (within 0.1", it matches the S4). The battery gained an extra 500mAh with only small increase in thickness (and virtually no change in weight).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei already had a selfie-friendly phone with the Ascend P6 and its 5MP camera, but the Ascend P7 takes it to another level. The new selfie-shooter has an 8MP BSI sensor and dedicated software modes like face enhancement and selfie panoramas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Ascend P7 is a fine upgrade over its now-outdated P6 predecessor, but in the grand scheme of Android rivalry it didn't get the package quite right. Besides the chipset performance, the 13MP camera with 1080p video recording is not flagship material either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smartphone makers made yet another big leap in early 2014, while the Huawei Ascend P7 feels like it's only catching up with the 2013 models. Huawei's official pricing of ?450, however, points to 2014 flagship ambitions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though it's thicker than its predecessor, very few phones can match the slender body of the Ascend P7 still. The Samsung Galaxy S4 is slightly thicker than the P7 (7.9mm), but the former flagship has come down in pricing and can match the Ascend in most categories - exceeding it in some (chipset, main camera), but lagging behind in others (front camera, "only" 100Mbps LTE).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the new Galaxy S5 too - it's more expensive, but has better specs across the board (including a water-resistant body). The Galaxy Note 3 phablet is priced virtually the same as the Ascent P7 right now. Besides the roomy 5.7" screen you get other goodies too like a fast chipset, 2160p video capture and the active S Pen stylus.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you're looking at older devices, the Sony Xperia Z isn't one to miss. It doesn't have the greatest 5" 1080p screen, but even its old Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset compares well against the P7's Kirin chipset. The Xperia Z has a front and back glass design similar to the Huawei's but it is also water-resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, with the official P7 pricing in mind you can look at the Xperia Z1 too. It's thicker than its predecessor (8.5mm), but brings a Snapdragon 800 chipset and a large 20.7MP camera sensor, a whopping 3,000mAh battery too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The LG G2 packs a 5.2" screen in a body that's about the same size as the Ascend P7. Sure, it's thicker than it, but with a fast Snapdragon 800 chipset, optical image stabilization for the 13MP camera and another huge battery (3,000mAh again) the G2 is a great deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Pro 2 phablet with a 5.9" 1080p screen is an option too in this price range. It drops OIS feature from the camera but adds 2160p video capture and features a similar thin bezel design as the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here we should also mention the Nexus 5 made by LG. It's the smartphone of choice for the pure Android fans with a 5" 1080p screen, Snapdragon 800 chipset, 8MP OIS camera and an affordable price for those specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG G2 ? LG G Pro 2 ? LG Nexus 5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Star 1 launched recently with a 6.6mm thin body and a 5" 1080p screen. It's powered by a Snapdragon 400 chipset (quad-core Cortex-A7) and runs Android 4.4 Jelly Bean. It also packs LTE and a 5MP front-facing camera, in addition to the 8MP main camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other ZTE options include the Nubia Z5S - 7.6mm thick and weighing 126g. It's powered by a Snapdragon 800 chipset and captures 2160p video with the 13MP main camera. It has a 5MP front-facing camera too. Note the Z5S doesn't seem to be on sale yet, but the Nubia Z5 from late 2012 is similar, except for the Snapdragon 600 chipset and 1080p video capture. Both Nubias are on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean for now.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Having mentioned a few phablets already, we should add the Oppo Find 7a. That's the 1080p version of Oppo's 5.5" phablet armed with a 13MP camera that can do 50MP shots using a special mode and also record 2160p video. The phablet has a 5MP front-facing camera and Snapdragon 801 chipset, but won't break the bank.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Alcatel Idol X is a budget alternative that measures 6.9mm thick and has a 5" 1080p screen, though it lags behind the Huawei with a slower chipset and mostly no LTE. The Idol X+ is expected to launch this month and while it's a millimeter thicker, it does have a better chipset and battery than its predecessor. There's dual-SIM connectivity too, though still no LTE (this might not matter to you depending on your carrier and country). This one loses the microSD card slot though and both run Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Outside of the Asian market, we can't help but draw comparisons with 2013 flagships. If you've had a Huawei before or are willing to give it a chance, the P7 certainly has its charms, which it shares with some of its neighbors. Still, the midrange is where a lot of Android darlings live and the Ascend P7 might as well make itself at home - assuming Huawei quickly drops the price to more competitive levels.</paragraph>
