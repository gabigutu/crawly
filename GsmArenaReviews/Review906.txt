			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the most common questions we encounter as writers and editors for mobile tech revolves around which phone to buy. We've taken it upon ourselves to share our insight with more than just our friends, so we're starting a recurring article of phones we feel give the most bang for your hard-earned bucks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Obviously, we're not just going to recommend the flagships of the day. We're splitting up the guide by price category, starting with sub-?100 handsets and going all the way to the very best devices available in stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that we're looking at off-contract prices. On-contract devices come cheap but get you saddled with an expensive plan for a year or two, which masks the true price of the device. Besides that, carrier subsidies vary from market to market, so we can't really provide information that will be relevant to everyone if we factored them in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also omitted any phones with limited market availability, as we want to make sure that you'll actually be able to buy the phones listed here, rather than just read about them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the price categories we're looking at:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll be updating this guide regularly - as phones age they generally become cheaper, and might slide into lower price segments (and within your budget).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Under ?100<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This category used to be ruled by feature phones, but Android-powered smartphones are putting on the pressure big time. Most of the phones in this category end up being dual-SIMs, as most emerging markets they targeted have incomplete carrier coverage. But at this price point it doesn't hurt to have a second SIM slot even if you don't use it most of the time. Plus, single-SIM versions of many of these phones are either not available or not meaningfully cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>People looking for a phone under ?100 prioritize utility and cost. As such. all of these will have you chatting on social networks, using email and doing light web browsing. Dual-SIM support keeps things cheap - you need to buy just one phone and with two lines you can get a better deal on call minutes and texts than you can with a single SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Y is an old model - it came out in late 2011 - but it's cheaper than certain feature phones. It runs Gingerbread on a slow CPU with little RAM, but it's good enough to browse the web, check email, install IM clients and simple apps of your choice. The key advantage here is that the featurephone ecosystems are particularly barren, so even a simple smartphone like the Galaxy Y can be much more flexible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While finding worthwhile feature phone apps is near impossible, some phones come with a good app package out of the box. The Nokia Asha 210 Dual SIM comes with a browser, email client, WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter pre-installed, which is what most people need anyway. There are even GTalk and Yahoo chat clients.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 210 Dual SIM is for people looking to do a lot of talking and texting on the cheap. The hardware QWERTY offers a much better typing experience than you're likely to get on a sub-3.3" touchscreen. The phone has Wi-Fi, so you don't need to pay for a data plan to access social networks, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha range has touchscreen devices too, like the Asha 501 Dual Sim. This one comes with almost the same messaging skills as the Asha 210, save for the WhatsApp client. What you gain with the bigger touchscreen over the Asha 210 (3" vs. 2.4") is easier web browsing, though this comes at the cost of comfy typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Young Duos is the 2013 successor to the Galaxy Y. It has a slightly bigger screen with double the resolution and a faster chipset. The chipset is nothing spectacular, but the 768MB RAM is pretty good. The Galaxy Young Duos also runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, which is fairly recent. Plus, for a 50% price premium (around ?30 in this case) over the Galaxy Y, you get a second SIM slot and a better screen, OS and chipset.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?100 - ?200<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ?100-?200 category has plenty of affordable smartphones, some of which are surprisingly good. We won't bother mentioning 3G and Wi-Fi here as advantages as those should be standard on anything over ?100. Here we're looking for good all-rounders - good display and chipset, decent camera and modern OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While these phones are not the best in the business, some people can safely say they bought them for the features rather than the frugal price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 is nearing two years old, but the 3.8" WVGA screen, which is much sharper than the screen of its predecessor. The dual-core Cortex-A9 CPU with Mali-400 GPU is also the first taste of real processing power. Similarly, the 5MP camera gives us the first bite into HD (720p) video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It costs double the price of the Galaxy Y, but is leagues ahead in practically every aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 520 is the most popular Windows Phone handset in the world and for a good reason. It's powered by a faster chipset (dual-core Krait CPU and Adreno 305 GPU), which already puts it ahead of the Galaxy Ace 2. Design is another advantage, and the 520 matches the current trend of bold colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8 may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the user interface is simple, the OS has good functionality out of the box and a growing list of apps. While Android is not the smoothest OS on low-end devices, Windows Phone is highly optimized for the few platforms it runs on. Besides, using an alternative OS (the old iOS vs. Android tug-of-war) has a certain appeal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WP8 also has great integration with Microsoft products, including a free Office document editor. The Lumia 520 stands out of the WP8 crowd with free Nokia exclusives, including an offline SatNav app with license for one country, a data-saving web-browser and the Nokia Mix Radio streaming service. This makes it a great, affordable phone for people on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Windows Phone 8S is an alternative to the Lumia 520. It's a pretty device in its own right and comes in a wide range of colors too. Both are priced the same have practically the same hardware, except the HTC has a slightly better screen and a bigger (but non-removable) battery - 1,700mAh vs. 1,430mAh. It has 4GB built-in storage instead of 8GB, but both can be expanded with microSD card slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More crucially, the HTC 8S lacks access to Nokia's exclusive apps and services. It does have Beats Audio, which can be valuable depending on your usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has another value-for-money WP8 phone, the HTC Windows Phone 8X. It has a sharp 4.3" 720p screen, 8MP camera with 1080p video capture and a fast chipset. Those are specs that are virtually impossible to come by at this price point. The chipset is a dual-core Krait at 1.5GHz, with 1GB RAM, Adreno 225 GPU - same as the flagship Lumia 1020 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 8X is not the most compact 4.3" phone by any measure, but it has good HTC looks, a polycarbonate body and a relatively big 1,800mAh battery. It has Beats Audio too, if you're into that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We come back to Android with the Sony Xperia L. It has a 4.3" screen too, but of FWVGA resolution unlike the HTC 8X. The Snapdragon chipset is the slower dual-core 1GHz Krait / Adreno 305 version too. The Xperia L also lags behind the 8X in that its 8MP camera records 720p only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, if you want a compact, Krait-based droid with a good design, the Sony Xperia L is a serious candidate. Plus, it has 8GB of storage you can expand with microSD cards in case the limited storage of the 8X is a deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want a dual-SIM Android in this price bracket, check out the Acer Liquid E2 duo. It has a 4.5" qHD screen and a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor. It's not exactly a speed fiend, but it runs very decently and has an 8MP camera that records 1080p video. Plus there's a relatively big 2,000mAh battery, DTS sound enhancement and rear stereo speakers to sweeten the pot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?200 - ?300<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now that we're done with the budget options, we've come to the sweet spot for mass market smartphones. They have HD screens, fast chipsets, 1080p video cameras and enough features overall to satiate all but the geekiest of geeks and power users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single-SIM version of the Sony Xperia M didn't make the cut in the previous chapter, but the Xperia M dual is a capable, pretty dual-SIM Android phone. Compared to the Xperia L it has a slightly smaller screen (4" vs. 4.3"), but the emphasis here is on a compactness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has the same chipset and while the still camera is a 5MP shooter, the video camera only goes up to 720p. Keep in mind that neither the M or L have great cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This category also houses a few aging (if one-year-old counts as aging) flagships, starting with the Nokia Lumia 920. It doesn't have the monster camera of the Lumia 1020, but it's still a good 8MP / 1080p shooter with optical image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart from the camera, the specs on the Lumia 920 and 1020 are virtually identical and you'll get the same software. Yes, you do get an LCD rather than AMOLED, but it's among better LCDs we've seen. The 920 may be bulky, but at least it doesn't have the camera hump on the back. Plus, the price difference between the two is big enough to buy a real camera - the Lumia 1020 is more than twice the price of the 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R819 is another dual-SIM Android and while it's pricier than the Xperia M dual, it compensates with a better screen - a 4.7" 720p LCD. It also has a better camera - 8MP with 1080p video capture. Better still, it's features a stunningly thin 7.3mm body. Despite the slender build, the phone packs a 2,000mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaTek chipset with quad-core Cortex-A7 and PowerVR SGX544 GPU is not our favorite, but is certainly fast enough. The only complaint we have here is that the storage is fixed at 16GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned size before and it is indeed an important consideration - some people won't buy a 5" phone even if they can afford it. The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is one of the more compact smartphone offerings, as it's barely bigger than an iPhone 5s but manages to fit in a 4.3" screen. It has qHD resolution so it's not Retina-sharp, but it's a Super AMOLED, which has its share of fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon chipset with two Krait cores running at 1.7GHz with 1.5GB RAM and Adreno 305 provides plenty of processing power for the class and the phone runs a recent Android 4.2 version. The 8MP camera with 1080p video capture stacks up very well against similar cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 mini comes in LTE and dual-SIM versions too, but those are a bit pricy right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia SP balances advanced features and affordability. It has a sharp 4.6" 720p screen and it's almost the same size as a Moto X. Speaking of which, the SP uses a similar chipset to the Moto X with two Krait 200 CPU cores and an Adreno 320 GPU (much more powerful than a 305). It only has 1GB of RAM, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has an 8MP camera that records 1080p video, LTE connectivity, 8GB of expandable storage and a sealed 2,370mAh battery. And as with other Xperia phones, the SP's design is quite cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate is the cheapest worthwhile phablet - it has a big 6.1" screen of 720p resolution, a Huawei-made chipset (quad-core Cortex-A9) and runs Android 4.1, upgradeable to 4.2. The Mate has a huge battery - 4,050mAh - which performed great in our battery test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet also packs an 8MP camera with 1080p video capture and 8GB of expandable memory. Phablets are a growing segment and offer a large screen for browsing, document editing and gaming along with impressive battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sometimes smart money is on a former flagship - having been replaced, its price has dropped significantly, but it's still a premium device. The Samsung Galaxy S III is one such phone. It's fairly compact for its 4.8" Super AMOLED screen with 720p resolution and has a very good 8MP / 1080p camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Exynos chipset with four Cortex-A9 CPU cores and Mali-400 is the stuff of geeks' dreams that it used to be, but performs well for a midranger. It runs Android 4.1 and has already started receiving its 4.3 update. The 2,100mAh battery is not huge by today's standards, but you get decent endurance out of it. The 16GB of expandable storage gives you plenty of room for multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 has a stunningly thin 6.2mm body and pleasant metallic back. Design is a strong suit for this one, even if it goes too far with the iPhone obsession. It has a 4.7" 720p screen, Huawei's quad Cortex-A9 chipset and an 8MP camera with 1080p video capture. Despite the slender build, the P6 has a decent 2,000mAh Li-Po battery and even expandable storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend P6 can be a good introduction to Android for former iPhone users who want a bigger screen - it's thin, light, attractive, and made of good materials, plus the custom Emotion UI is highly customizable and iOS-like at its base. Better still, it's not a huge financial risk to try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 is not as cheap as it is Stateside, but it is still a great package for its class. It has a 4.7" WXGA screen and comes with a powerful for its class Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset. Better still, fast Android updates (to stock Android no less) are guaranteed for at least a few years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP / 1080p camera isn't the best but it's passable. The bigger problem is the limited storage - 16GB with no expansion slot. That's not great for the price range. Battery life is also less than stellar. Still, pure Android fans don't have many options at this price point.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>?300-?400<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is a relatively narrow segment with some premium devices that aren't quite flagship material. These devices are for people looking for something missing from the ?200-?300 offerings without going overboard with the spending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G is the former LG flagship and the basis for the Nexus 4. It's a little pricier, but it resolves two of the more common complaints people had with the Nexus 4 by adding 32GB of built-in storage and LTE connectivity. You also get a better 13MP / 1080p camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do, however, lose the pure Android version with timely updates. The Optimus G did recently get a 4.2 update, but don't hold out much hope for an official 4.4 build, as even 4.3 might take a long while (if it is available at all). Still, if you like the Nexus 4 package but not the storage or lack of LTE, this is one way to go. Even the battery life is better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini is the second mini we're recommending, but it's noticeably pricier than the first one. Still, it has the same lauded aluminum unibody design as the HTC One, which might appeal to those of you who hate large, plastic-y Android phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.3" screen has 720p resolution - none of that qHD nonsense we had with the Galaxy S4 mini - plus the front-facing stereo speakers are cool and there's LTE on all models. The non-expandable 16GB storage and 4MP camera without OIS might be deal-breakers, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This price segment also yields a device on the opposite end of the size spectrum. The Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3, as the name suggests, is a phablet with a 6.3" screen. It is in essence an upscaled Galaxy S4 mini. The screen does have 720p resolution, which keeps the pixel density at a decent 233ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the relatively speedy Snapdragon 400 chipset (dual-core Krait 300 @ 1.7GHz, 1.5GB RAM, Adreno 305) and LTE. The 8MP camera shoots 1080p video, there's 8GB of expandable storage and a good 3,200mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia ZR is a more compact version of the Xperia Z ? it has a 4.55" 720p screen ? but keeps the highlights of the Z. It has an attractive design, Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset, 13MP camera and, of course, water-resistant body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compact, powerful phones are rare even at this price range, but the water-resistant design of the Sony Xperia ZR opens up possibilities for summer fun that are out of reach for most other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 5 is official after tons of leaks and is a real beast in its price range. It has a 5" 1080p screen and is powered by a Snapdragon 800 chipset (the most affordable phone that offers that combo). There's also the 8MP camera with optical image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 5 also adds LTE, which is missing from the Nexus 4, an important feature for countries that are having LTE networks rolled out. It's an excellent device for pure Android fans, with flagship specs at far sub-flagship price. The 2,300mAh battery may not last long (we're guessing here), but the added wireless charging sounds nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 5, of course, runs the latest Android version (4.4 KitKat) and will get quick updates as new OS versions become available, at least for a year and a half (the 2-year old Galaxy Nexus was cut off, which might have been due its TI chipset and the chip designer's exit from the phone market).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that we're looking at the 32GB model, the 16GB one is ?50 cheaper, but we don't think it's worth it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>?400-?500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now we're officially in flagship territory, even though this isn't the top tier category. Still, you need to have a good reason to go above ?500 as these devices will fulfill almost anyone's needs with cutting-edge features from this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z came out at the beginning of this year so it's getting a bit old, but it's still an excellent phone - it has a beautiful glass-and-aluminum design and is the first water-resistant device we'd recommend. The Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset is old for a late 2013 flagship (but that is most noticeable in benchmarks) and the 13MP / 1080p camera isn't up to par. The screen has poor viewing angles, but is decent otherwise. Also, the water-proofing didn't prevent Sony from putting in a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 improves on the camera, chipset, display and even battery and water-proofing rating, but is in a different price bracket. If it's outside your budget, the Xperia Z will do nicely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 needs no introduction - Samsung has spent tons of money on ads and over 40 million people have already bought one. The plastic-based design isn't anyone's favorite, but it fits a 5" display in the footprint of last year's 4.7" flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a Snapdragon 600 chipset, which until recently was the best in Android-land (and is clocked higher than other S600s), an excellent 13MP / 1080p camera and tons of proprietary features (detecting a hovering finger, split-screen multitasking).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One important tip - the Galaxy S4 also comes in an Exynos 5 version. Samsung has tuned both to have similar performance overall, but since the Exynos one lacks LTE you might find it cheaper in some places,which make it worth it for countries without LTE coverage. On the other hand, the Snapdragon 600 version is also compatible with official pure Android releases - you don't need the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already saw its smaller sibling, but the HTC One deserves a recommendation too. It's one of the most beautiful Android phones at the moment (if not the most, depending on who you ask). It has a great 4.7" 1080p screen and a 4MP UltraPixel camera with optical image stabilization. Throw in the fast Snapdragon 600 chipset, stereo speakers on the front and a pure Android option like the Galaxy S4 and you have a strong contender.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will certainly draw people who dislike the plastic build of most of Samsung's phones along with audio buffs (the One has great audio hardware).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 Midnight is a beautiful 5" Android phone with an excellent 1080p screen. It's powered by the Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset and has a there's a 13MP camera with 1080p video recording. By the way, we picked the Midnight edition as it has 32GB of built-in storage. The regular version is ?30 cheaper but it only has 16GB storage and with no microSD card, it's a problem. Disappointingly, there's no LTE connectivity (which might not matter if your county's operators don't have it either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 is an outlier (good if you're tired of the usual suspects) and while it has its flaws, it shows promise from the company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case the Ascend Mate and Galaxy Mega 6.3 phablets weren't good enough, have a look at the LG Optimus G Pro. It comes close to current phablets with a 5.5" 1080p screen, Snapdragon 600 chipset, 13MP camera and 3,140mAh battery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>?500 and above<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Call this the "money's no object" category, where only the best of the best will do. This category consists solely of flagships that were launched in the second half of 2013 - you'd be surprised how much of a difference even half a year can make in the tech world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here we're also including phones that didn't make the cut by virtue of their money over value ratio, but rather phones that are exemplary in some category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is the revamped Xperia Z. The most impressive upgrade is the relatively big 1/2.3" sensor with 20.7MP resolution. That's point-and-shoot camera territory (including the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom) but it fits in a slender 8.5mm body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The body is once again a triumph of glass-and-aluminum design and sports the latest Snapdragon 800 chipset with an even higher water-proofing rating than the Xperia Z. Then there's the big 3,000mAh battery and expandable storage - difficult to pull off on a thin, water-resistant phone but Sony did it. It's a bit large for a 5" phone though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera produces impressive shots - check out our 6-way camera shootout - and has some interesting proprietary camera features (how about streaming video to Facebook live?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 could have made the cut earlier, but we left it for this category because of LG's Apple-like pricing strategy - the 16GB version is too limited by storage, but the 32GB costs ?100 more. We wouldn't recommend 16GB storage as those HD videos (especially 1080p @ 60fps) and advanced 3D games will devour it in no time. And if not for the video or games, the beautiful screen, powerful chipset and 13MP OIS camera will go to waste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the LG G2 does have an amazing 5.2" screen with 1080p resolution that fits in the footprint of the Galaxy S4 and HTC One. It also packs a Snapdragon 800, which trumps the S4 (at least until the S4 LTE comes out), a 13MP camera with optical image stabilization and a lasting 3,000mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design might not be to everyone's tastes, and the volume rocker on the back is especially unusual (the tap to wake option has its detractors too). It's also plastic, which isn't up to par with the HTC One or Xperia Z1. Make no mistake though, the LG G2 is one of the best Android smartphones available at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1020 is the true successor of the Nokia 808 PureView and has the most amazing camera ever found on a mobile phone. A huge 1/1.5" sensor with a whopping 41MP resolution creates amazing shots and with supersampling to 5MP, sharing is easy. Nokia is creating a ton of proprietary camera features like lossless digital zoom, manual controls and the Refocus app. Oh, and the 1020 is the only phone with a powerful xenon flash. The audio recording for videos is top notch too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do have to deal with the protruding camera hump on a phone that's not slender to begin with, and Windows Phone 8 could be a plus or a minus, depending on your preferences. It has a decent 4.5" WXGA AMOLED screen and dual-core Krait chipset, but Androids are wholly unimpressed. The 2,000mAh sealed battery is also not great, but you can get the grip accessory for an extra 1,020mAh and a more comfortable hold on the phone (albeit with added bulk).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This phone is all about the camera as it takes pictures like no other phone. Point-and-shoot cameras have a tough time competing, too. But if not for the camera, we can't justify more than double the price over the Lumia 920.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the third iteration of the highly successful phablet series with an S Pen stylus. It has a beautiful 5.7" 1080p Super AMOLED screen and is powered by a Snapdragon 800 chipset, both of which make the split screen multitasking a real treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Pen also enables other multitasking options - it makes note taking and searching that much easier, and packs even more proprietary features than the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera did okay for stills and is absolutely amazing for video - it can record stunning 2160p video and excellent 1080p @ 60fps clips (better than the LG G2). For video, it has digital zoom that rivals the Lumia 1020s optical zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 breaks away from Samsung's traditional plastic design - it's still plastic, but the faux-leather back is very convincing and really classes up the place. By the way, the device's size hasn't changed since the Note 2, despite the increase in screen diagonal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is targeted at business people (who will appreciate KNOX enterprise security) and power users who will love the huge mountain of features. If we had to go over them all, we'd have to copy and paste the review here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just make sure you're getting the N9005 version with Snapdragon 800 CPU - the N9000 with Exynos 5 lacks LTE and 2160p video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to the Apple iPhone 5s. Don't get us wrong, it's an amazing smartphone but the pricing gets harder to swallow each passing year, especially when you can have good Androids and WP8 phones at half the cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a gorgeous device no doubt, with a thin and light aluminum body and people really seem to enjoy the new gold color option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera shows improvements over the 5s, but we can't shake the feeling that that it falls behind the curve. The new Apple A7 chipset is a modest beast (don't be fooled by core count and clock speed, it's a new architecture) and iOS 7 brought some much needed improvements. The TouchID fingerprint sensor is not a novel feature, but it's the best implementation on a smartphone yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, as is usually the case with iPhone's, we come back to the problem of storage - 16GB just isn't enough these days (unless you don't store multimedia or play a lot of games) and the 32GB version costs as much as two Nexus 5 units with the same amount of storage.</paragraph>
