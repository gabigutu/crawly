			<paragraph>XpressMusic is back on Symbian turf. Last time we checked the musical talent was playing second fiddle to smartphone skill but maybe it's time for the tables to turn. Nokia have ditched the swivel and are playing it rather low key on the 5320 exterior. Fair enough, less express in XpressMusic but no complaints elsewhere: FP2, HSDPA. Well geared up in terms of connectivity and running on the latest Symbian, Nokia 5320 will hardly count solely on the XpressMusic branding. What it can sure count on is our careful scrutiny. Let's play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bar-shaped Symbian-powered Nokia 5320 has a distinctive youthful appeal and is obviously targeted at the younger audience. The middling feature load and moderate price also come to confirm that. Let's have a look at some of the alternatives that are currently on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6120 classic can pass as a budget version of the 5320 for those with no ear for music. It has half the RAM, no RDS and doesn't sport the Feature Pack 2 but as far as the rest of the specs sheet is considered the two devices are identical. The 6120 classic however is a good 40 US dollars cheaper, which might be a good enough reason to go for it instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5700 was the last XpressMusic-on-Symbian edition. Larger and heavier than the 5320, it has a bigger screen and better keypad. Its swivel design may as well be another selling point as you don't see many of those recently. However, the 5700 can't match the Feature Pack 2 and 128MB of RAM in 5320. With the prices of the two handsets so close it is completely a matter of user priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i450 sure doesn't go unnoticed in this class. It has the same price tag as Nokia 5320 and sports a much larger 2.4" display and the rare dual-slide design. The unique Touch-wheel key scores another point. On the negative side, the i450 has worse screen quality and is notably heavier than Nokia 5320.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you find Nokia 5320 just short of having everything you need you may wish to consider Samsung i550w. It tops the Nokia in terms of WLAN and screen, if you're willing to dish out 25% more. We personally find WLAN and the larger display utterly worth the extra dime even if Feature Pack 2 is missing. And the audio quality kicks butt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we're not totally clueless about the whole mid-range music phone shebang, we're set to go. Join us after the jump for more on Nokia 5320.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 5320 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5320 measures 108 x 46 x 15 mm and has a volume of 67 cc. This is compact enough for a smartphone though we've seen them get even tinier. The phone is pocketable and with a weight of 90 grams it won't make those baggy jeans any flabbier.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of the Nokia 5320 is obviously trying to catch on with the younger audience. The handset has an all-plastic construction and, although we didn't fall in love with it in an instant, we find it quite nice to look at. The dimpled surface at the back and sides might not blend perfectly but they do provide a really nice grip and make the 5320 really hard to slip off your hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video-call camera and a key called "My own" are symmetrically placed on both sides of the earpiece at the top of the front. My own key is a customizable shortcut to any function of the phone but its location makes it somewhat uncomfortable to use. It's way out of reach when holding the phone normally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the front panel is taken by the 2" display and the keypad, which will receive their due attention in a little while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Nokia 5320 features the dedicated camera key and the volume rocker. They are both large enough but slightly embedded and thus not so easy to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three dedicated music controls on the left are way handier. They are nice and tactile, and after a short while can be used without even being looked at. The card slot on the same side however is not so nicely worked out. The problem is the etched bit where you are supposed to stick you finger to remove the cap is completely covered by the rear panel. This means you either have to remove the battery cover or use a pointed object to open the card slot cap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of Nokia 5320 features the power key, which is also used for alternating the active profile and locking the keypad. We would've preferred it a bit larger but it is still usable enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom are the microUSB slot (under a plastic lid), the 3.5mm standard audio jack and the charger plug. The lanyard eyelet is also here but attaching a strap involves opening the battery cover too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the Nokia 5320 hosts the 2 megapixel camera and its dual LED flash. The camera performance will be discussed towards the end of our review in more detail. As for now, the only thing to mention is the lack of any lens protection whatsoever that renders it vulnerable to scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover lays the 890 mAh Li-Ion BL-5B battery. It is quoted at 250 hours of stand-by, 3 and a half hours of talk-time and 24h of music time. The numbers aren't mind-blowing by any means and performance turned out even worse. We had to charge the Nokia 5320 every other day even though we didn't use it all that much. We guess with a little tweaking (reducing the light timeout, turning off 3G or switching the screen-saver off) things can improve but miracles are really unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, the construction quality of Nokia 5320 is decent. There were no creaks or other disturbing noises when handling the phone. All plastic though it may be, the handset feels sturdy enough and wear and tear is not likely to kick in too quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5320 has just the right size for holding in hand. It's no problem operating either single or two- handedly and, even with the strangely placed My own key, we're more than happy with ergonomics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A small display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5320 is fitted with a 2" 16M-color TFT LCD display of QVGA resolution. It is obvious we won't sing praises of screen size. After all, 2-inch displays belong below and seeing one in what's not exactly a budget handset is a bit upsetting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture quality makes up some for the small size with vibrant colors and good brightness. Good sunlight legibility is well taken for granted in a Nokia.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Keypad OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad on Nokia 5320 fares decently with large and solid to press keys. Touch orientation isn't the best we've seen and this somewhat hurts the typing experience. Once you get used to the phone and the particular keypad pattern you'll sure be fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selection keys, as well as the call and end keys, are much to our liking, with ample size and proper placement. The D-pad is very comfortable, causing little trouble even to people with very large hands. The menu and the clear keys are just a tad small and may need some time getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting is solid and strong enough, no issues with Nokia 5320 in the dark.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Considering its midrange standing, Nokia 5320 has a very decent retail package. The medium-sized box has most of the things you are going to need when using the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 1GB microSD card starts the list in our case but in some regions a smaller 512MB card will be shipped instead. A DC charger goes without saying, and so do the bunch of papers and the PC sync software CD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star of the retail box is the smart XpressMusic handsfree, that comes in two parts. You've got the essential 3.5mm standard audio jack and the remote pad, and you can replace the actual headphones if you like. The remote is also equipped with a lapel clip. Finally we found a microUSB cable to be used for connecting your phone to a computer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Nokia 5320 signal reception is great. The phone has commendable speaker quality and the sound during calls is clear and free of any interferences. Vibration is also strong enough to make sure you never miss an incoming call or message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results from our loudspeaker test are at your disposal - Nokia 5320 XpressMusic turned out to be a very good performer in this respect. Check out the table showing how it stacks along some of the handsets we've put to the same test. In case you want to find out more about the test itself or a complete list of tested devices, hit the link.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S60 3.2 UI is the best a Symbian smartphone can offer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5320 runs on the Symbian 9.3 OS with Series60 3rd Edition user interface. Being among the first devices to have the Feature Pack 2, Nokia 5320 brings both visual and performance upgrades.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing to notice is the standby screen, which now offers four different modes, allowing to arrange the shortcuts as you please. There is a horizontal and vertical layout where you get to pick the shortcuts in the first tab and a new layout we're seeing for the first time. It has shortcuts to the music player, search application, the web browser and the gallery of your Nokia 5320. Finally you can disable the active stand-by and assign shortcuts to the four directions of the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5320 also has a My own key which has nice functionality. It allows you to assign any function you like to it and access it from anywhere around the user interface. The two soft keys' functions can also be varied according to the user preferences but they only work when you are on the stand-by screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the S60 UI Feature Pack 2 brings some graphic improvements as well. Animations are now available when browsing the menus. The task manager has also received a face-lift and is now appearing on every pop-up menu. It's actually placed on top of every list, which may seem somewhat irritating at times. In addition, you can still use the well-known shortcut by pressing and holding the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 128MB of RAM is an important factor to OS performance. In Symbian terms 128MB is virtually impossible to deplete even with several applications running in the background. As a whole, you shouldn't expect any Memory full warnings on you Nokia 5320.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 369 MHz ARM 11 CPU is also doing a pretty good job and there is no lagging or hold-ups when working with the Nokia 5320. Navigating the menus is fast with instant response to user commands. The blue circle next to the icon of a running application is a well known Symbian indication reminding users to quit unwanted applications that are still running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5320 built-in memory is 125MB, which is a good amount by most standards. The included 512MB or 1GB microSD memory card comes in very handy for extending it but you can go for an even higher capacity card if you like. Our test showed that Nokia 5320 had no problem handling an 8GB microSD memory card, but if you fill it up with too many small files it does slow down a bit. In all other cases, accessing applications or any other files from the memory card is quick and you probably won't notice a big difference from accessing content on the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any Symbian phone, there is a built-in voice recognition system. It's doing a good job, being fully speaker-independent and recognizing a high percentage of user commands. Its performance still falls short of what the Nokia N95 and N95 8GB were capable of, but not by a great margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customizations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5320 main menu offers four different view modes. Two of them are the well known 4 x 3 grid and a simple list. However there is no option for making the icons animated, as in the Nseries handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two available modes are the 3D V-shape and Horseshoe views. Visually appealing though they might be, those are not really as usable as the oldies. Font sizes are also configurable depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, you can change the currently active theme. There are five preinstalled themes on Nokia 5320, the rest being left to the imagination of the user, as many other themes are available online.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Symbian handsets have an excellent phonebook with virtually unlimited capabilities. There is storage space for practically unlimited number of contacts and fields, with all the available memory potentially usable for the purpose. Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one. We personally find it quite a challenge to think of something Nokia has missed here. Personal ringtones and videos are also available for assigning. If you prefer you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization is also nice and easy although you do need the Nokia PC suite for the things to go so smooth. Sending and receiving contacts via SMS or Bluetooth is also a piece of cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log application is another Nokia 5320 strength. It holds up to 20 call records in each of the tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls. These are all accessed by pressing the Call key on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you enter the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers. The period can be shortened to save some space but you are quite unlikely to do that, as even with a huge number of calls the log only takes a few miserly kilobytes of memory space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging comes right<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Texting with Nokia 5320 is spot on. With a decent keypad and great software support your correspondence is as good as it gets on this kind of devices. After all, targeting the young sure puts messaging in focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5320 supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. The SMS and MMS share an editor. It is the well known intuitive application from previous Symbian S60 smartphones. It has a counter of characters left to the limit of 160. There is also an indicator in brackets showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes without saying that a delivery report can be activated. The reports pop up on the standby screen and are subsequently saved in a separate folder in the messaging sub-menu. When you are exiting the message editor without having sent the message, the editor prompts saving it to the Drafts folder or discarding it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All it takes to convert a common SMS into an MMS is insert some multimedia content. A nice feature allows resizing pictures automatically for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5320 also features the dedicated audio message editor. Even if technically a type of MMS, the audio messages have their own separate editor. You can either record the message on the spot or use a previously recorded sound clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is also very similar to what previous Symbian powered phones have offered. If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your email address and password to start sending and receiving emails. Nokia 5320 takes care of downloading all the relevant settings to get you going in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. There is also support for attachments, signatures and basically most of the things you can think of, so Nokia 5320 can meet almost any requirement regarding the user emailing needs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>XpressMusic player is not spectacular<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XpressMusic branding raises the bar high for the Nokia 5320 music player. Good it is but by no means exceptional: just on par with other recent Symbian devices. It has a huge number of supported audio formats, including MP3, AAC, eAAC+ and WMA but little things to top the business-minded Nokia E71 for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the dedicated music keys on the side and the new active standby layout, where the music player is one click away, are things that enhance the sonic experience. Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case a tab appears on the stand-by screen indicating the currently running track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sorting your songs by artist, album, genre and composer is automatic and searching tracks by gradual typing of the desired name is also available. Tracks are transferred to Nokia 5320 via Bluetooth, USB or by simple download. You can also use a card reader for that purpose and transfer them directly to your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon completing a USB transfer, or inserting a card, the phone automatically prompts scanning for new music tracks and, if allowed to do so, adds the new ones to the music library. The player comes with five equalizer presets and, should they seem insufficient, you can edit them or create new ones in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5320 XpressMusic also features an innovative feature called Say and Play. By using the phone's built-in speaker independent voice recognition, it allows you to play any stored track by simply saying its title or artist. A longer press on the My Own key activates this feature and it works much like voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Say and Play feature currently supports English and the pre-installed UI languages. However it should be able to pick up titles in any languages if they are pronounced in English manner or with UI language pronunciation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To search the tracks, the Say and Play features uses the metadata embedded into the tracks. If no metadata is stored, the handset will create ones based on the filename.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However due to some unknown and probably unit-specific) problem we couldn't get it running on our sample unit, although it was a final retail handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Nokia 5320 also comes complete with A2DP support. This means you can enjoy your music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is good, but not great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We certainly hoped audio quality will at last give XpressMusic more edge. The results turned out good but by far not the best in business. Still, the 5320 does stand out among most other Nokia handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our audio quality test showed that 5320 struggles to keep distortion levels under control. The stereo crosstalk is also far from the best we've seen but the rest of the readings seem just fine. Dynamic range and noise levels were by far the most impressive among them, with Nokia 5320 getting some of the best numbers there. So, with the 3.5mm standard audio jack and the memory card slot, Nokia 5320 seems ready to serve music to go.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5320 features Real player for playing your video clips. The video player can be displayed in both normal and fullscreen modes. When in full screen, the softkey functions are hidden so that they don't spoil the viewing experience and only pop up when a key is pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the smallish screen in mind however, you shouldn't be too demanding.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia 5320 has a nice simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. Unlike most other Nokia handsets out there, RDS support is included and the Visual radio is also on-board. If internet connection is available, the Visual radio application can download all the local stations and save them to the handset with their names.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of the Nokia 5320 isn't nearly as good as the one on the Nseries devices that sport Feature Pack 2 but still does the job. It has neither the fancy 3D view mode nor the convenient shortcuts that allow you to send or print the selected picture without opening the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opting between portrait and landscape mode has also been dropped, so now all the pictures appear in landscape. They can be zoomed up to 8x (if you happen to need that kind of magnification). Overall, picture browsing and zooming is really fast with almost no hanging even with larger photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery offers a slide show but it is not nearly as nice or customizable as on Nokia N78 for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the gallery file-management functionality (which even includes sending multiple files at a time) is insufficient you can use the file manager. It allows you to do almost anything you can think of with your files. Copying, moving, creating new folders - you name it and you bet Nokia 5320 can do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an application manager to take care of the installed applications on Nokia 5320. Not much to talk about here, as it is identical to the one in any other Symbian device. Its functionality boils down to providing details about installed applications, removing them and keeping a log of movements in either direction.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Below par camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5320 is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels, no auto-focus, nor lens protection. The LED flash comes as little consolation and can hardly convince us that imaging was taken seriously in the 5320.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the camera user interface does come right out of the blue. It is the same as the one on Nokia 6210 Navigator and we did happen to like it. It doesn't offer too many features but with a snapper like that it's quite understandable. Still the sequence and scene modes are all there and there is a really nice panorama mode where the handset can easily make panos with excellent stitching. However this panorama mode produces photos of too low resolution, which are only suitable for viewing on the phone screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality of Nokia 5320 is unimpressive. The phone is having a hard time keeping noise under control and the colors are rarely spot-on. In most cases, the photos look washed out (low contrast) and really lacking vibrancy (low colors). We didn't expect any better anyway - 2 megapixel is nothing serious nowadays, even for a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at the sample photos made with the camera of Nokia 5320 so you can judge for yourselves:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for video recording, the 5320 disappoints with QVGA resolution at 15 fps. The quality is not that impressive. Like the still camera the camcorder of the 5320 has trimmed down settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, you shouldn't even consider the Nokia 5320 if a good camera is what you are after. If this is not the case, join us on the more redeeming next page.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connecting people<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfer options are a decent count on Nokia 5320. Every common network data transfer medium is supported and so are USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP. HSDPA support just makes it all the sweetest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a card slot so if you have a card reader lying around you can transfer the data directly to your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The huge letdown about the Nokia 5320 connectivity is the absence of Wi-Fi. We got used to finding WLAN on our recent smartphones and we miss it in the 5320.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing would've been better on a larger screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the internet with Nokia 5320, like with all Nokia smartphones, is a nice experience. Even the most elaborate pages are rendered well and finding your way around them is a piece of cake The virtual mouse cursor earns the browser another point. It is easy to control and generally works great. A mini-map can be activated to help finding your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required. The zoom level is also easily adjustable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large amount of RAM is surely one of the best things that could happen to the browser, as it is one of the most RAM-demanding applications indeed. Now, even if you load very heavy web pages and have a few applications running in the background, you are extremely unlikely to run out of RAM. The web browser also has full support for flash and java content so you can bet that you can see all the content around the internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problem is the smallish display. Only 2 inches means the smallest fonts aren't always readable and you have to go for larger ones. This in turn limits the amount of text fitting on screen and forces the user to scroll even more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The time-management skills of Nokia 5320, like most other Symbian handsets, are really good. Just name the application and you can count on it that the handset has it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We start exploring the rich application package with the calendar. It has three different types of view - monthly, weekly and daily, and four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Every event has its own unique fields, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word and Excel and PDF files seamlessly. Editing documents is not supported, but hey, we're not talking Eseries here. If you would like editing enabled you will have to purchase the complete application at the Nokia Download center. The final ingredient here is the included ZIP manager, which allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other included PIM applications are a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. We are not going to get into detail with them, as their functionality and performance are familiar enough. The ActiveNotes application is also on board allowing multimedia content to be added to your notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The useful "Search" application is also aboard the Nokia 5320. Its reserved line in the active standby menu no longer comes as a surprise. After all, an application this useful deserves to be conveniently placed. The application itself finds almost every item in your Nokia containing a given keyword. From messages to settings, every bit of data is checked and then all results are shown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Nokia 5320 features a dictionary with a rather rich database. English comes pre-installed but you can also download dozens of other languages for free from the Nokia website.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games galore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming lovers will have no reason to frown at the Nokia 5320 preloaded content. There are 4 preinstalled games on our unit, and a shortcut to N-gage downloads. Unfortunately, N-gage support for Nokia 5320 is still in the works with no exact release date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of that, there are plenty of third-party games out there, so Nokia 5320 users can easily download both native and java titles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're talking XpressMusic, so we just have to say it: the 5320 makes a notable step up in audio quality. Still not the best in business, but it's way to go. The distinct youthful appeal is both a blessing and a curse, as it may put off those who favor smartphone power over music skill. There's some questionable design decisions too. They got rid of the swivel and, however subjective, possibly lost some of the charisma. Plus, the 5320 is definitely low key even compared to the way more modest 5310.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 15-months-old 5700 was well due for an upgrade, so a youthful music-centered Symbian phone has its reasons to hope for a success. The improved sound quality, FP2, the doubled RAM and the more compact size sound right but the 5700 has stereo speakers, and a better display and keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of Wi-Fi however is still a downer and so is the smallish display. We do agree that there aren't many Symbians in this price range to feature Wi-Fi but that doesn't make the 5320 any less exposed to pressure.</paragraph>
