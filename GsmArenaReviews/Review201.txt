			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tiny, yet remarkably solid, like a pebble tumbled smooth by the waves, there's something about Nokia 6600 slide that's really hard to resist. By the way, minimalist, extra smooth and exclusive stand equally well for any of the 6600 pair. While flip for gals and slide for lads may not exactly be set in concrete, gender-free demand is more likely for the black 6600 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of the same build and pricing, both the yesterday's 6600 flip and the today's 6600 fold are a treat to look at and handle. The differences in gear are minor, boiling down to a fair try to fine-tune the supply. The OLED screen and electromagnetic push-to-open in the flip are swapped for a 3-megapixel shooter and USB-on-the-go. Little secrets won't stay in the closet but there's enough disarming charm to go around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sleek and smooth Nokia 6600 slide is taking the soft almost seamless contours of its flip sibling another step up. While the hinge of the 6600 fold is an inevitable abrupt cut, the polished rounded edges of the tiny slider are kept intact. Unfortunately its great strength is also its greatest weaknesses - the ease, with which Nokia 6600 slide catches fingerprints, is terrifying. To make things worse, smudges are not that easy to clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Signature feature of the 6600 pair, tap commands are adding to the pleasure of handling the 6600 slide. Arguably, tap-for-time seems to make a lot more sense in the flip for adding an element of surprise with the hidden outer OLED screen, but we get it in the 6600 slide too anyway. Tap-to-mute is the second available command, which undoubtedly is a nice little perk to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, it's more than obvious the 6600 slide stakes quite a lot on exterior, so let's see if it repays. We're back after the jump with handling, looks and feel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6600 slide unboxed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Nokia 6600 slide is quite standard. The regular charger (not the mini variety), data cable, and a set of stereo headphones on a detachable remote are the things to find in the retail box. The 1000 mAh battery is here as well, and a quick start guide and a manual complete the tally. The only bonus inside is the 512MB microSD card that ships with the handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6600 slide 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 slide measures 93 x 45 x 14 mm and 52 cc. Those numbers yell compact and the phone is a joy to handle and will feel at home in the tightest pockets. The weight of 110 g, which gives the 6600 slide its pleasingly solid feel in hand, is mostly attributed to the metal body.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The notch of an earpiece is centrally placed right above the Nokia logo up front. The 3G-enabled handset sports a video-call camera in the top right corner, right next to an ambient light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.2" screen follows, which enjoys most of the slider estate. The glossy front surface is only broken through by the slightly projecting controls on the navigation deck below the display. When the screen is off, the display blends almost seamlessly with the body of the handset creating a nice monolithic effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although technically not an OLED unit, the 6600 slide display was among the finest we've seen by Nokia - in both contrast and color reproduction. It also had one of the widest viewing angles we've seen in a Nokia handset. We deal with a lot of phones in our line of work and it's been a while since we last saw a display that impressed us that much. Unfortunately, it's got one serious drawback - due to its bulging shape, it easily gets scratched when you put the handset face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600 slide screen supports QVGA resolution and up to 16M colors on a 2.2" diagonal. A Nokia trademark, sunlight legibility is great. TFT may be the garden variety screens but the slide beats the flip on that count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beneath the display rocker-styled knobs on both sides of the D-pad accommodate the soft keys and the Call and End button. The navigation frame of the D-pad is nicely projecting over an ample confirm key. All controls are comfortable to use and accidental mispresses are completely ruled out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display backlighting is relatively strong and even. Our only concern is the styling of the D-pad - the metallic finish looks coarse and unsightly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding up unveils the alphanumeric keypad, which takes the entire lower deck of the phone. The plastic keys with pleasant metallic finish are amply sized, well defined and solid to press. Mistypes are quite unlikely, and we are very happy with the build quality and the comfort of use. Even the long-standing slider issue of insufficient headroom for the top row of keys is partly dealt with by the oval contour of the sliding bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The blue backlighting is very strong and even to make the handset a pleasure to use in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top side of Nokia 6600 slide you'll find the data/headset port under a neat plastic cap and the battery cover latch. The lanyard eyelet is on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right and left side of the handset are pretty bare, featuring only the tiny charger plug al the way up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the 6600 slide is completely clear too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our shape-and-looks tour with the rear. The steel battery cover features a dual LED flash right under the 3-megapixel camera lens. Dead center at the bottom is the loudspeaker grill, aligned to an etched Nokia logo. One complaint we have here is that sound does get muffled when the phone is lying on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing the battery cover, which is easier said that done, reveals the powerful Li-Ion 1000 mAh (BL-4U) battery and the SIM compartment. The SIM card compartment is caged under a metal bracket, which was a bit rigid at first too. But the biggest disappointment is the memory cad slot, which rules out hot-swap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is a nice little perk - the phone stuck out for a good 5 days on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tiny slider is a real treat to use. The elegant rounded lines and subdued gloss do make the compact handset a rare gem. The sliding action is smooth and solid, with a surprisingly short run. The only concern regarding looks is the fingerprint mess the glossy surface ends up after a surprisingly short while.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 employs the Series 40 5th edition user interface, FP 1. Except for the newly included Maps application, the interface has undergone no notable changes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen of Nokia 6600 slide features the pre-selected wallpaper with the usual status readings, such as signal strength, battery status, ringing profile icon and time in the top bar. The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The font on the main display can be of any color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode is available. It consists of four tabs that can be edited or relocated as users see fit. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions denoted by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player, radio and calendar. At the very bottom the "Note" bar appears, but it can also be changed to let's say "Search Web". Quite naturally, the two soft keys behavior can also be customized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons themselves haven't been changed a jot, keeping the well known design with animation of the selected icon. They can also be freely reordered within the grid, should the user find their original order inconvenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Submenus appear as lists. As usual, alphanumeric keyboard shortcuts to menu items are enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is quick and responsive. There were freezes or unexpected restarts for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside of the S40 user interface seems to be the lack of multi-tasking support - something that Sony Ericsson have implemented on their feature phones long ago. With S40 you can't just minimize a Java application (such as the Opera browser for example) and go read a new message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Sony Ericsson phones you can even switch between two running Java applications - (Skype and Google maps are some nice examples here). Nokia isn't there yet with S40, so we guess that puts us on the waiting list for the 6th edition of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six predefined ringing profiles on Nokia 6600 slide. These should be enough to cover virtually any scenario. Flight mode is at hand too, turning off all transceivers and rendering the phone usable without a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The background color of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper, can also be easily modified by changing the active theme. There are four themes preinstalled on the Nokia 6600 but downloading new ones is only a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A superb phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Nokia 6600 slide stores up to 2000 contacts and that sounds more than enough. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 6, including a video-call number. First names are separated from last names eliminating problems, which may occur with synchronization. Ringtones can be assigned to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. Caller image is different for incoming and outgoing calls. It fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and appears much smaller when you are calling one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contact list: Normal Name List, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Image. It can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at the same time. Contacts can be ordered by either first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook font size can also be modified, should this be necessary, and it's an option that will surely be widely appreciated. And lastly, the well-known grouping is also present. This means that contacts can also be organized in groups and these can subsequently be used as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application to mention here is the voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary. There is also a Voice aid application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice extra is the Find-on-Map option which locates the contact's address on the new Nokia Maps for S40 application if it is entered correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 6600 slide is the well-known S40 application. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them in bulk. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception and in-call sound are no concerns with Nokia 6600 slide. The handset is pitched for the so-called Background Noise Cancellation. One thing Nokia forgot to say though is that almost all current S40 midrange phones also feature this feature called Voice Clarity. Anyway, sound is loud and clear on both ends and you will have zero trouble with your calls. Vibration strength in the 6600 slide is very good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's about time though Nokia introduced some sort of smart dialing in their feature phones, as most competing manufacturers have already done. It's quite convenient and might save the extra clicks to get to the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out Nokia 6600 slide is bellow-average performer. You can't count on getting just everything in noisier environments, and calm and subdued ringtones surely won't do. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite up to the task. Nokia 6600 slide is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email, as well as flash and audio messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do to turn a regular SMS into MMS is insert some kind of multimedia content. As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can fill by simple typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with the most recent addressees in the call register. There is even the very handy option to define a favorite message contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and organized in a practical time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. The T9 dictionary and the handy delivery reports go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will break down into displayed on the screen. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type. A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio messages have a separate editor, which can either record the message on the fly or use a previously recorded sound clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is doing pretty well to meet most user needs. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Sent attachments are not limited in size. Either message headers only or entire messages can be downloaded by default, depending on your choice.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Traditional music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Without doubt, the music player is among the nice applications of Nokia 6600 slide. It has decent looks and all-round functionality, including album art and a good number of formats supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is controlled with the D-pad. Besides all the typical functions, the music player of Nokia 6600 slide also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, MP4, WMA, AMR-NB, Mobile XMF, SP-MIDI, MIDI Tones (64-tone poly) and True tones. Naturally A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Customization options for the player are surprisingly diverse. There are 5 extra themes on top of the default. The other ones are called Blue Moon, Cubes, Dot matrix, Sound waves and Black. They differ not only in font and colors but graphics as well, and we welcome the improved visual customization of the S40 music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sonic experience gets enhanced by equalizer presets and stereo widening. There are 5 equalizer presets on Nokia 6600 but you can easily create new ones thanks to the two user defined slots available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quaity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of Nokia 6600 slide is decent, save for the really high IMD+noise reading. The phone now has commendable noise and dynamic range levels and the frequency response has also been improved from what we have seen in previous Nokia handsets. Here go the results so you can see for yourselves if Nokia 6600 slide is good enough for you.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative for the preloaded content on Nokia 6600 slide is the FM radio. It uses the audio player interface and covers all basic functions. Much like the music player, the FM radio also has five different themes to pick from. RDS support is available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of Nokia 6600 slide is compatible with 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The option to hide soft key captions to make better use of the full screen mode also improves the viewing experience. Of course, much like the FM radio and audio player, the player works in the background appearing on the active standby tab. Another nice thing is that all six skins of the music player are available for the video player too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is not impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have been keeping track, you'd know that we aren't really in love with the looks of the S40 gallery. The fact that it is an inherent part of the file manager is probably the main cause of disappointment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is not the fastest (especially for larger pictures) and the most capable around, so it is practically of little use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures can also be viewed full screen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter offers a very limited number of options (as a contrast to almost every Samsung phone with a bunch of editing features), so Nokia 6600 slide users are highly unlikely to take up photo editing on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search option, which is quite convenient for finding a specific file in overfed folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole we aren't really pleased with the S40 gallery and we do hope that it will be one of the first things to improve in the future versions of the UI.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent 3.2 megapixel camera with autofocus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 slide is armed with a 3.2 megapixel camera with image resolution of up to 2048 x 1536 pixels. Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited but - after all - reasonable given the mid-range shooter. The available settings include white balance, three quality levels going form basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED flash is rather inadequate, usable with close range objects only. Another drawback is the lack of a dedicated camera key, the D-pad is in charge of focusing and capturing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6600 slide camera is hardly among the top 3.2 megapixel shooters. Image quality is about average; in favorable weather decent images can be produced, a bit oversharpend, but with good color rendering. Noise levels still remain high in areas of uniform coloring. The lack of detail in images is another weakness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera speed isn't remarkable and saving files is on average too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Due to technical reasons we are unable to show you sample photos from Nokia 6600 slide camera at the moment. We will try our best to rectify this as soon as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, Nokia 6600 slide manages VGA resolution at 15 fps. The 3GP video clips length is only limited by the memory available. Although video quality is far from stunning, the VGA resolution is still rare enough across the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a Nokia 6600 slide sample video shot at VGA resolution (15 fps).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has its pro and cons<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6600 slide connectivity options are more than decent. Wired connectivity is upgraded to USB On-The-Go. In a standard USB connection to a PC the mobile phone is a peripheral, while the PC acts as a host.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB OTG upgrade however allows portable devices such as the Nokia 6600 slide to also act as a host and have peripherals of its own. We guess, card readers or USB flash devices are the most likely peripherals for a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This kind of host capability is rather limited unlike the one of the PC. Since the portable device provides a limited current for powering up the potential peripherals, so you should stake on only approved (or known-to-work) peripherals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To connect any peripheral however, you will need a compatible adapter cable. Unless you get hold of one of those, the wired connectivity options are limited to standard USB. Since we didn't have one so we couldn't test the feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity options include the network support - EDGE and GPRS are both the best there is at Class 32 while there is also a dual-band UMTS support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way if you are interested where you can find UMTS 2100Mhz or you are not sure whether it's supported in your country, you should definitely check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the memory card slot, which can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring data, is also present here but again, the lack of hot-swap questions its usability.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 slide has an integrated HTML web browser. No significant changes in functionality have been made to the S40 browser since the previous edition of the user interface. Therefore you shouldn't be surprised that it is lacking a lot of the skills of the more advanced alternatives. It still offers decent page rendering and font size customization. When set at the smallest font, up to 11 text lines get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the phone is also equipped with an alternative web browser. The Opera Mini is located in the application section and is really the better browsing choice on the 6600 slide. It is far more intuitive and fits text better than the integrated browser. The overall browsing capabilities of Nokia 6600 can hardly be compared to the best on the market but it's still a decent offering.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of Nokia 6600 slide is truly elaborate, offering a large number of time management applications with nice features and user-friendly interface. The calendar offers month, week, and day modes and five types of events available for setting up. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. The event types are: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Further, each type of event has its own specific fields and some of them even allow an alarm to be set up as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next-in-line is the handy To Do manager that enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. Those can also be easily synchronized with the calendar application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are available as well - their length is limited to 3000 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia 6600 slide calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition a loan calculator is also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6600 slide comes with a good number of preinstalled applications outside the organizer too. The consistently useful unit convertor is first in the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Download! application follows, which directly connects to the Nokia download center, where you can find a lot of downloadable content for you phone, most of it free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application is a built-in Yahoo! Search piece of software. After setting the country or region you can conduct web search for images and other information. The 20 most relevant search results are returned to your phone upon request. Find out more about the Search at nokia.com</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia WidSets are mini applications, which bring favorite web content to your mobile phone. The Java based service is offered by Widsets.com and it can work on every regular Java phone as well. Among the most popular widgets are the mobile versions of YouTube, Flickr, Ebay, Wikipedia, IMDb, and various weather forecast and news services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final featured application is World clock for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps for S40<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps has finally arrived on select S40 devices and the Nokia 6600 slide is one of the handsets to feature it. Among the things you can do without a GPS receiver is browse maps, look up addresses and locations, and plan routes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Map Loader application for PC you can download map data to a compatible computer, and transfer it to your device to save on data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps offers straightforward route planning. Having entered a start point and a destination, the application will plan your route with easy-to-follow directions to where you're heading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you pair the phone with a Bluetooth GPS unit, it turns into a full-fledged navigation decice. Furthermore, turn-by-turn visual and voice guidance are available upon purchasing a navigation license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting down some Landmarks while you're on the go, or saving locations in the Favorites section is another available option. Favorites contents can also be exported/sent via MMS, which is a nice extra too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Classic board game fans will be glad to find Backgammon II on the Nokia 6600 slide. It is a nice Java interpretation of the popular game. Snake is essential to Nokia phones, its presence in Nokia 6600 slide is barely a surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next two games in line are the sport simulation Golf Tour and the Java version of the popular Japanese game Sudoku. All the games have decent graphics and are comparatively easy to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Highroller Casino, Rally 3D and Soccer 3D are the other three titles Nokia 6600 slide offers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To wrap it up, Nokia 6600 slide rounds off a nice little family get-together. It's a neat cross-section of the Nokia midrange from the basic comfort of the 3600 slide through the exquisite elegance of the 6600 flip. With some 6500 slide and classic in the distant background, Nokia 6600 slide is put right in the middle of a rich tale of family ties and heritage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, 6600 slide tops the 3600 slide right where it counts: screen estate, 3G and looks. So, we guess, it's a point won for the 6600 slide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compact and suave slider is a good match for the outlandish charm of the 6600 fold. The 6600 pair does well to achieve cohesion and distinct identity but we can't help the thought that the specific targeting of the girly flip makes it a little bit more focused. Not to mention that it's a lot easier for the 6600 fold to get away with being overpriced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we end up exactly where we were with the 6500 classic / 6500 slide duo. One is outspokenly driven by looks, the other tries to bring an extra dimension of skill but ends up harder to define and exposed to a lot more pressure.</paragraph>
