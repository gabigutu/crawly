		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can't make a phone that everyone loves and Apple is not even trying. Much like any other iPhone so far, the iPhone 4 is a phone that everybody loves AND hates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple?s latest is always the greatest ? you have to give them that. Sometimes it seems they put less effort into making it than in letting people know they did. But with the Apple iPhone 4, they were obviously hard at work. The 4th generation iPhone has an all new look, new feel and plenty of new skill. We already caught a glimpse of the iOS4. But there?s much more: a 1GHz chip, two cameras, HD video and of course the Retina display ? the highest-res screen we?ve seen so far on a GSM phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely there are still enough blank spots on the feature list but that?s Apple and its iPhone. Compromises are being made in every phone out there anyway. But the simple fact is Number 4 is the best iPhone to-date. Let?s see how good that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, most of the main disadvantages are simply passed from one generation to the next but - whatever iPhone you?re coming from - the Number 4 will tick most of your boxes. Upgraders will be used to the shortcomings, and unbiased observers will have less points to complain against.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It just seems some features will be forever missing. The iPhone?s memory isn?t expandable and you can?t use the thing as an external drive (this also means that files are only transferred via iTunes, again). Bluetooth has been upgraded to cover not only for music and calls but a compatible wireless keyboard too. File transfers however are a no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of Flash support in the Safari browser is no surprise given the Apple-Adobe feud. Luckily there?s the good old YouTube app to partly make up for that but Flash games are still out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is now a secondary video-call cam but the ?reinvented? FaceTime video calls feature only works over Wi-Fi (for now) and between two iPhone 4?s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the multitasking, this is the closest the iPhone has ever gotten but there is no true multitasking, and certainly not for all apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've probably also heard of the user reports of reception issues and you're wondering how much of that is true. Well, we've checked that in detail, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that (and a bit more) aside, the new goodies seem to merit at least some of the iPhone 4 hype. The Retina display is gorgeous. The 3.5? capacitive TFT touchscreen has four times the resolution of the older iPhones. At 640 x 960 pixels, it?s the best we?ve seen ? statistically. But perhaps the most impressive too, for its actual performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a generational leap in imaging too. The first two iPhones had a single 2MP fixed focus camera on board. Last year?s 3GS tried to make some sense with a 3-megapixel autofocus snapper. With the iPhone 4, Apple are finally beginning to look good. The primary 5-megapixel autofocus camera not only takes impressive images but shoots 720p videos too. Oh, and it has a LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let?s see what else is in that tiny white retail box and check out those shiny glass panels. Let the iPhone 4 unboxing begin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Apple iPhone 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new iPhone comes in a tiny white box with not much in it. Underneath the phone itself, we found the usual set of accessories: a charger, a USB cable and the same set of earphones with a 3.5mm audio jack as the one of the 3GS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Amidst the booklets (an iPhone 4 brochure and product guide) we came upon the SIM eject tool and a couple of stickers with an apple on them. That?s that. No free bumper case, no polishing cloth, no dock. You?re buying a 600 euro phone SIM-free ? and you?re supposed to be able to afford some extra accessories.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 4 bumper case<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We finally got out hands on the iPhone 4 original Bumper case. It turned out pretty much what we expected it to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bumper case is made of high quality rubber with external buttons for the volume and lock keys, duplicating the iPhone 4 ones. They are made of the same metallic material as the iPhone's own keys and leave the impression you are actually using the real keys instead of external replacements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only exception is that the top side of the Bumper case had the nasty habit of pressing the Sleep/Wake button on the iPhone 4 no matter where you touched it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Bumper case tightly sticks to the metallic iPhone frame. Thanks to it the iPhone 4 has now much better grip and feels secure when held in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the most important question - the iPhone 4 bumper case solves all antenna issues you may be having. It successfully prevents the attenuation and you will be safe from dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4 bumper case is definitely a looker, but it conceals all metallic elements on the iPhone 4 (the frame) thus toning down the looks of the phone. The black variety that comes free from the Apple bumper case program is no match for the iPhone 4 stylish personality. A brightly colored case would have been much better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 4 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Three generations and an iPad later, the iPhone finally looks different. Better. At 115.2 x 58.6 x 9.3 mm the iPhone 4 is impressively slim and obviously less curvy. The weight has stayed almost the same at 137 g, an emphatic statement of the newly found poise and presence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metallic frame around the body actually consists of two separate parts and both are individual antennas. You probably have heard by now, that this design is reportedly causing some reception issues. Well, we're about to test that further down in the Telephony section of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new materials used on the iPhone 4 account for much of the weight. A stainless steel band frames the handset top to bottom, scratch-resistant glass covering both the front and rear. The trademark curved back is now gone and it?s not the phone?s loss but the user?s. The iPhone 4 looks great but just isn?t as comfortable ? and secure ? to handle. It just feels way more slippery to hold in hand than the previous two generations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>OK, a new look for the iPhone does sound risky. After all, they didn?t bother to change the design for three generations and still sold ship loads of the thing. The Number 4 is here to open a brand new page in the iPhone history but a complete departure from the original styling could?ve been way too adventurous.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest, Apple simply nailed it. Some will tell you the Number 4 has just about nothing in common with its predecessors. They may be right. We wouldn?t call it a complete overhaul though. You know, one of the things that made iPhone what it is, was the belief that no design is the best design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When all you have is touchscreen and an interface that sets the standards for user-friendliness, you don?t need to put the focus elsewhere by getting too fancy with the finish. The iPhone is one of the most minimalist phone designs out there and Number 4 knows better than to try anything stupid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Apple had no design to start with, made very little changes to it and ended up with a brilliant new design. What do you call it? Here?s one ? magic. The iPhone 4 is thinner, sharper, more advanced, refined. The one thing to note probably is that it somehow feels more delicate than the older versions. This has nothing to do with the build and finish ? we wouldn?t call the iPhone 4 fragile (despite glass being inherently quite easy to shatter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you put a 3GS and an iPhone 4 side by side on the table, you may have a hard time noticing a profound difference. That?s when the screens are off though. Once that gorgeous Retina Display powers up, you will want to turn off the 3GS and put it hastily away to save it the embarrassment. Hard to believe it was considered one of the better phone screens out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the rear, the new styling is way more prominent. Instead of plastic there?s glossy glass surface that is said to be scratch-resistant and quite more sturdy than plastic. But as it turned out, if you want to get it scratched or broken, you?ll succeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The oleophobic coating ? both front and rear ? is supposed to reduce fingerprints but there isn?t much you can do to keep the high-gloss surface clean. The special coating at least makes sure smudges are easily removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up front, the newly added secondary camera is located right next to the earpiece, on the left. Above the display we also find the proximity and the ambient light sensors. The round Home button is all there is at the bottom.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Retina display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4 Retina display is the highest resolution screen we?ve seen in a mobile phone. Retina is just a marketing name made up by Apple to differentiate it. But it doesn?t need the extra differentiation cause it?s among the best screens we?ve seen too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new display has the same size as those on the previous iPhones (3.5 inches) but the the resolution has been bumped up four times. From 320 x 480 pixels on the previous generations, the new iPhone 4 screen has the amazing 640 x 960 pixel resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the increased pixel density (reaching 326 pixels per inch) images now appear way sharper (or smoother, if you like) than before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Based on an IPS panel, just like high-end desktop displays, the new iPhone?s LCD screen has LED backlighting and resulting contrast ratio of 800:1, which is 4 times the previous ones, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality things look as impressive as on paper. The 16M-color capacitive iPhone 4 display delivers great image quality. Colors are vibrant, blacks are deep and the sunlight legibility is remarkable. The viewing angles are excellent as well, comparable to the results of Samsung?s Super AMOLED displays. As for touch sensitivity, it?s excellent, too. Of course, multi-touch support is here again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the iPhone 4 display stacks up against the competition:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Going around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Apple iPhone 4 features the Ring/Silent switch and the volume controls - two separate round knobs instead of the rocker button in previous versions. Those are prominent enough and surprisingly solid to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side the microSIM card slot is all there is. To remove the SIM card you need to use the enclosed SIM eject tool or a paper clip ? or even a pinboard pin would do. Again, there is no hardware camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the traditional Sleep/Wake button as well as the standard 3.5mm audio jack. Next to the audio jack is the the extra mic for the active noise cancelation during phone calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is reminiscent of the previous iPhone generations. It has the proprietary Apple USB cable/charger/dock connector, as well as the tiny loudspeaker grill and mouthpiece on either side of the connectivity port.The iPhone 4 surely would have made a good use of a pair of stereo speakers. As it turned out in our dedicated loudspeaker performance test the single loudspeaker is not that good. But more on that further on in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flat glossy rear features the lens of the 5-megapixel autofocus camera. The LED flash next to it is another iPhone novelty. As usual, the battery is not user replaceable and there is no memory expansion slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 4 is powered by a 1420 mAh Li-Po battery, which is quoted at up to 300 hours of stand-by, up to 14 hours of talk-time and up to 40 hours of non-stop music playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 09 July: We just concluded our dedicated iPhone 4 battery life test and we are pretty pleased with it. The iPhone 4 managed almost three days on a single charge under some normal usage (or at least what we consider normal) including the following:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's better than what we hoped for and certainly much better than the iPhone 3GS. We were even pleasantly surprised by the dedicated video playback test - the iPhone 4 played our test video for 9 hours and 40 minutes before the battery went down. Downright impressive!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Come to think of it, Apple were too kind to original iPhone owners. They used pretty much the same design over three generations and the iPhone 2G users didn?t feel their device outdated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Number 4 turns it all upside down. All the functionality upgrades aside, rarely have we seen an upgrade that makes the previous one feel so old, if not obsolete? The Apple iPhone 4 has an extra premium feel that few contemporary flagship phones can match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The finish is impressive ? the level of refinement and sophistication is all the more remarkable considering the altogether minimalist design. The iPhone 4 is nothing short of beautiful. Handling will perhaps be less comfortable at first, if you?re coming from any of the older iPhones. The Number 4 just doesn?t allow as secure a grip.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>iOS 4.0: at full throttle<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 4 is can be installed on any iPhone 3GS and ? technically ? 3G. We see no point porting it on a 3G though ? the whole thing gets dismally slow and some of the new features are not supported anyway. What matters now is how the OS performs on the iPhone 4. There's a quick video you may have already watched in our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to its gorgeous new screen, better still camera and vastly improved camcorder, gyro sensor and video-call camera, the iPhone 4 is the device on which users can genuinely appreciate the potential of iOS 4. iPhone 3GS can run it almost without any compromises but you?ll get the fastest and most seamless performance on the iPhone 4 and its 1GHz Apple A4 platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On an iPhone 3G you will get neither homescreen wallpapers nor multi-tasking. The rest of the stuff is there, but the performance drop is too much to bear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let?s be positive here ? we have an iPhone 4 and a 3GS to enjoy, which is more than enough. You might have already been through our iOS 4 review ? you'll find it's got a lot of common with the follwoing part of the iPhone 4 review. You will find identical wording, don?t you worry, we?ve made sure all the details are updated with iPhone 4 specifics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s start with the changelog:</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>And the stuff iOS 4 failed to deliver<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>General user interface and key features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The traditional flat interface should be all too well familiar by now. Tap an icon to open an application; press the hardware Home key to close the application and return to the Home screen. That's all there is to it. Only the Settings section goes several levels deep. Basically that?s all you need to control your iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can group up to twelve apps into a single folder. Check out the video below to see how it?s done:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s easy, isn?t it? Folder names are automatically generated depending on the selection of items you?re grouping together. But you can rename folders anytime. The folder icon is also created automatically ? it simply displays the icons of the apps inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The folder animations on 4 and 3GS are fast and fluid, while on 3G you can notice a slight lag. Still we are happy Apple didn?t cut them out of the iOS 4 for 3G users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new iPhone 4 does pack a serious punch under the hood. The previous iPhone 3GS is a responsive device by all means, but the capable hardware in the Number 4 makes quite a difference. The iPhone 4 is faster in all aspects - general interface response, programs, menu scrolling, web browser, app loading, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it?s time for multitasking. Just to be clear here, Apple gave due warning it wouldn?t be the multitasking that hardcore users expect. It?s more of a quick app switching than actual multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To start the task switcher you double click the hardware home button below screen (there goes our Favorite contacts shortcut). At the bottom of the screen, a side-scrollable row of icons will display, showing the running apps. You can kill apps by tapping and holding on an icon ? you then hit the red corner switch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple?s idea of multitasking is not to let apps run in the background, but instead pause them at their current state for later access. There are exceptions for certain apps ? such as the iPod or Pandora ? they can actually play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the paused apps are not actually working in the background and that way you can have more than 30 different apps readily accessible in the task switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The positive side is the ability to quickly resume any of these apps exactly where you left them even games ? with no new loading times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only one drawback is you can?t leave MOST regular apps do their thing in the background and return to them later. If they are not among the lucky few enabled to properly run in the background (such as Pandora), they would simply pause instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a quick demo video of how managing apps works on the iOS 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that not all apps are multitasking enabled. If you minimize a game that?s not yet compatible, later when you get to it again, it will start from the beginning instead of it resuming where you left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, the task switcher is a scrollable list of icons ? but if you swipe to the right you?ll get quick iPod controls and shortcuts, along with the accelerometer lock switch. The latter will enable or disable portrait orientation lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite iPhone 4 and 3GS finally have multitasking support, the push background notifications service is also onboard. The service can inform you of new events in applications that support it (such as some IM client) by changing the app icon (via an icon badge), by invoking a pop-up reminder or via sound alerts. In the same time the applications can simulate that you are constantly online.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Homescreen wallpaper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple at last has the one thing that should have been there from the very beginning. Yes, we knew it would be there, we?ve seen it on jailbroken devices, but it?s still kinda cool to finally have it official.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 27 pre-installed wallpapers which you can set on both the lockscreen and homescreen. At least half of them are really nice and colorful too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen scrolling is fluid and the animation looks good, as it should. You can also set a custom picture ? move and scale options are available too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Enhanced Spotlight search<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The system-wide search engine Spotlight has been updated too ? it now has shortcuts for search in your default internet search engine (Google/Yahoo/Bing) or Wikipedia. You can type your search directly in Spotlight and tap on Wikipedia or Google. Safari will open automatically and will run that search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Spell checker reports for duty</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another major addition is the spell checking service. It works in the relevant places such as Messages, Email, Safari, Notes, etc. Every unknown word gets underlined in red and a tap on it reveals the suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The automatic correction is still available and works as well as in the previous iOS versions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All earlier features are there of course<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just as a quick reminder, cut, copy, paste, undo and redo are available since the previous OS version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 4 has the two features that debuted on the iPhone 3GS: Voice control and the magnetic compass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice Control app supports lots of commands: call a phone name/number, play music by song/album/artist name, shuffle music and Genius support for playing more similar songs. The iPhone 4 comes with an expnded list of supported voide commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice Control app can be launched with a longer press of the Home key. The interface is quite simple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compass works in both Google maps and third party maps, but also has its own application, which displays your exact GPS coordinates and lets you choose between true North and magnetic North.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated application seems quite inaccurate at times and quite often reported interference. In Google Maps however, the map compass orientation is quite accurate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New settings and security options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s see what?s new in Settings. The guys over at Apple aren?t the kind to let you meddle deep inside your phone but still there are a few new tweaks inside among the usual connectivity, display, sound, messaging and security options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems the Cellular Data on/off switch is now available on every iPhone, regardless of your carrier or country. It?s nothing new, but it now works properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a new security option for locking your phone too ? you can now choose between a simple (4-digit) and a long alphanumeric lock code. We guess this makes some of you feel much safer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 4 now offers dedicated options for the location services. You can now enable or disable the access of apps to location-based services from one central location.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Changeable search engine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned in the Spotlight chapter, you can set your preferred search engine in the Safari browser. The available options are Google, Yahoo and Bing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bluetooth keyboard support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The last piece of new stuff is in Keyboards. You can now choose your preferred keyboard layout: QWERTY or QWERTZ, for example. What?s more, you can set the layout of the Bluetooth keyboard you?re pairing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also limited dictionary functionality. It becomes available when you choose a specific secondary keyboard ? we?ve so far confirmed only Chinese Simplified. Then under the keyboard settings you?ll get a new option for a custom dictionary ? a place where you can enter custom words that are off the standard punctuation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than all that, iOS4 looks just like the previous releases except for a few updated icons here and there. By the way, the new Calculator icon ? it?s a complete WinMo 6.5 rip-off.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slightly improved contact management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS phonebook hasn?t changed one bit, you?d think upon a casual look. It?s the same as Apple had it back on the first iPhone. OK, almost. There is one thing they did fix after all ? the Edit Contact interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All those annoying buttons for adding new phone/email/address/etc. are now replaced with text fields. You will never again be redirected to a new entry page, all contact?s details are filled directly on the main screen. Yes, it was about time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we really miss in the iPhone?s Contacts app is the social integration. Most of the Androids, and even some feature phones, out there have already taken full advantage of enabling Facebook and Twitter right in their Contact lists, complete with profile and status updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really hope Apple decides to implement this in the upcoming iOS 4 updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact search box and the dialer for that matter still don't support Smart dialing (though Spotlight is perhaps a good enough substitute). The phonebook also lacks an interface for deleting contacts en masse or at least the slide-to-delete option that is widely available in mail, notes and other third party software and can be easily used for deleting contacts without opening their details.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What do you know, Apple invented video-calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>?People have been dreaming about video calling for decades. iPhone 4 makes it a reality.? Says Apple on their website. Alright, each of these two statements is true on its own. It?s what they?re trying to imply that is absolutely incredible. The correct wording should?ve been: Ever since the first iPhone, people hoped that maybe ? just maybe ? video-calling will at some point be enabled? erm sorry, invented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>FaceTime is perhaps a valid premise for Apple to claim (re)inventing video-calling. Well, they did. Apple?s video-calls only work via Wi-Fi and only with another iPhone 4. You can start a FaceTime call right from your phonebook or switch to FaceTime mode during a voice call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They may tell you it?s good that you don?t get charged for any data involved, but it seems they?re doing carriers a favor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to loudspeaker performance, there?s nothing new about the new iPhone. It struggled to make the Below Average mark and that makes it the worst of all iPhones we?ve tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other letdown concerning the iPhone 4 telephony is its proximity sensor. In theory this sensor should lock the display when you hold it next to your face during a call so you won't press any buttons with your cheek by accident.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the new proximity sensor fails to do its job very well, allowing the screen to turn on when there IS an object nearby. You can learn more about it in our blog, where we also published a video demonstrating the problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Our take on the iPhone 4 reception woes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You know ? this year iPhone invented video-calling, we hope trouble-free signal reception is coming up next year. Now, seriously, we know you?re all eager to hear about the ?awesome? new external antenna and the unfortunate reception issues. All the ?you?re holding it wrong? stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s what we experienced with the iPhone 4. Signal bars do drop ? and rather fast too ? when your palm and fingers fold around the bottom left side of the handset. Contact with skin most certainly interferes with the antenna and the phone is effectively losing signal. But ? and it?s a big BUT - we had no dropped calls because of this, nor any voice quality issues in areas of full strength signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In areas of spotty coverage, where the iPhone 4 reported only a single bar or two, things got messy. Even touching the surface of the phone, caused the voice quality to worsen and touching the bottom left corner consistently dropped the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can also confirm that any type of a bumper case will eliminate the issue ? we tested with an improvised rubber strip along the edge and signal remained steady.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We went ahead and did the same test with an iPhone 3G and it definitely looks that the bottom-left-corner-issue aside, the iPhone 4 has noticeably better reception than the 3G. It held on to signal more steadily and caught on signal much quicker when exiting a no-signal area such as a tunnel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So as a conclusion, if the coverage in your area is good enough (full bars), touching the two antenna parts on the side and bottom of the handset simultaneously, may compromise the quality of reception a bit, but it won?t cause any dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, dropped calls are quite easy to recreate persistently in areas of relatively low signal, however a bumper case, or anything that will protect the handset from contact with human skin, will sort those problems just as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A boost to messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging app has been greatly improved since the iPhone OS 3.0 ? better thread management with (mass) delete and forward options, turning on/off message reminders and previews, plus the full MMS integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Via MMS you can receive vCards, audio files and location data. On the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 you can even send video over MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing an MMS is as easy as it gets. You can attach an existing photo or you can take one with camera just before sending. One image can be captured or selected at a time. To take another, you have to press the camera icon again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sending multiple photos, GPS coordinates or clips is initiated outside the messaging department via the respective Share function of each app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 4 brings lots of message improvements too. Steve Jobs mentioned nothing at the unveiling, but this doesn?t mean the messaging app hasn?t got any new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is the SMS character counter, which honestly just took too long. It?s there finally, but to use it you?d need to activate it in the messaging settings first, because it?s disabled by default. Strange, isn?t it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second upgrade brings SMS search. The search bar is placed above all your conversations and works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 4 packs some major modifications in the Email department ? an aggregated inbox, thread support and email archive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aggregated inbox (called All Inboxes) brings all messages from all your email accounts in one place. Some may find this feature useless, or at least messy ? there?re no account labels. It has its uses anyway and we are happy to see it in iOS 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email threading is also enabled and works just like the conversations in the Messages app. All emails you exchange with a given contact are grouped into a single thread. A numeric indicator on the Email main screen shows the number of emails stored in every thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, comes the Archive option. It?s only available when you sync with Gmail. You can choose between Archive or Delete as the default action in the Email options. If you select Archive you?ll never lose an email. It will be archived instead and available for later access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple thought about users who have installed additional office applications. If you want to open an email attachment with another app instead of Quick Look, you just need to tap and hold on it. A menu with the available options will appear. Obviously not all third-party apps are compatible with the feature ? we got only one showing up in this context menu ? Apple?s iBooks app. It appears when the attached file is in PDF format.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery displays Albums, Events, Faces and Places<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone?s gallery is rather simple and easy to work with. It hosts all you pictures organized in different albums or tabs. When you open a specific album you can scroll through the images with swipe gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one interesting thing though. The iOS 4?s gallery opens every image slightly zoomed in so fits the whole screen without leaving black bars. If you want to view the full picture, you?d need to pinch or double-tap to zoom out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you use iPhoto software on any of the Apple computers, you are now able to sync your Events, Places and Faces image holders. In iPhone?s gallery you will notice the respective four tabs available at the bottom ? Albums, Events, Faces and Places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Albums holds all of your synced, downloaded and captured images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Events and Faces folders on your iPhone 4 can only be filled with content from the iPhoto photo organizer on your Mac. You can?t populate them with photos from your iPhone?s camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All geotagged photos (saved from web or shot with the iPhone) appear in Places where they show up as pins on a map. Tapping a pin shows a small thumb with basic information about the image.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The better iPod<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 3.0 OS enabled local search in the iPod player, as well media scrubber, shake-to-shuffle, third-party app access to your library and stereo Bluetooth headset/speaker support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 4 treats the iPod player to a single, but important upgrade. You are now able to create, edit or delete playlists straight on your mobile (as opposed to only getting them from iTunes).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After you?ve created a playlist, you can add or remove tracks from it anytime you want directly on your iPhone. There is no need to sync with iTunes. Yes, we know it?s an option available on almost every other phone, but we are happy to see Apple finally respond to users. The iPhone maternal dependency on iTunes for uploading any content is perhaps the single greates limitation of Apple?s iOS and it?s the cause for a host of silly discomforts such as poor performance of iTunes under Windows (much improved in the recent year) and the limitation of syncing multimedia content to the iPhone from a single computer only. Syncing to iTunes on another computer will delete all the content of the same type uploaded to your iPhone before that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality impresses<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's hardly a secret that all the previous iPhones had perfectly clean audio output with relatively low volume being their only problem. However Apple have obviously done the right thing and fixed that here, making the iPhone 4 one of the best music player among the mobile phones that we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact the iPhone 4 is identical to the iPad tablet as far as audio output is concerned (volume levels included), which makes us suspect that Apple have somehow managed to squeeze similar hardware inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's cut the small talk and give you the results so you can see for yourselves what a great music player the iPhone 4 is. It might be about time that you retired that old iPod of yours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Apple iPhone 4 frequency response is simply perfect</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about the test itself and the meaning of the different numbers in the table here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Very simple video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s the iPod app of course ? and it makes no sense that in there you can access all your downloaded clips but not the videos you captured with the phone?s camcorder. The video playing interface is very simple, with nothing more than the usual player controls and a scrubber for precise skipping back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Supported video formats are not really varied and as you probably already know, DivX and XviD videos are out of the quiestion without a conversion. The nice thing about the iPhone 4 is that it can easily play 720p HD videos. Unfortunately, FullHD 1080p video is not supported - they can't even sync to the iPhone via iTunes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Updated 9 July: The nicest thing about watching video on the iPhone 4 is its efficient battery. We just concluded a dedicated video playback test for battery life. The results are surprising - the iPhone 4 kept playing our test video for good 9 hours and 40 minutes making it the best perfomer in this area that we've seen so far.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 4 has a 5 megapixel camera capable of taking photos at up to 2592 x 1936 pixels. There is a LED flash too, which may even make some difference given the back-illuminated camera sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has both autofocus and touch AF, which are fast and quite accurate. The latter even tracks moving subjects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera user interface is neat and simple ? the only controls are a shutter/rec key, flash settings and a small thumbnail in the corner that shows the last photo taken. Oh, and there is a switch to toggle between the main and the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is the best the iPhones have pulled off. Color rendering is quite nice though oversaturated and in broad daylight there?s plenty of resolved detail. So overall you get sharp and vibrant images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grainy effect of the high noise levels we saw back the 3GS photos is still visible on the iPhone 4 samples too but only when you preview the shots at 100% magnifications.There?s no sign of chroma noise, it just seems that Apple R&amp;D prefers that untouched grainy look that is more sparing on the fine detail. Otherwise they could have wiped it clean with some noise suppression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We never though we'd say that for, but resolution-wise, the iPhone 4 camera is among the best performing 5 megapixel cameraphones out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also noticed the field-of-view is bit narrower than we would have liked. We estimated it at being somewhere around 38mm in regular 35mm equivalent. Now that?s a lot, especially when there are already phones with 28mm wide angle lenses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back illuminated sensors such as the one on the iPhone 4 usually deal better with noise in darker scenes so we were curious to see the high ISO performance. For this test we used Samsung Galaxy S for comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the iPhone 4 samples get quite noisy and the slightly oversaturated colors suffer the most. Again, the reason for that is Apple?s laid-back approach in noise suppression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung R&amp;D has applied a more conventional technique ? the higher the ISO, the higher the noise-suppression. As a consequence, the Samsung Galaxy S looks a lot smoother at ISO400 but it lacks some of the fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point we can?t really see a tangible advantage of the back-illuminated sensor of the iPhone 4, but we also can?t call the Galaxy S photos that good. Both processing techniques make compromises, it?s just that you?d have to pick which compromise bothers you less.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Apple iPhone 4 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. You can see how the Apple iPhone 4 image quality compares to that of some of the other handsets we have reviewed. Clicking any of the following three images will take you to our dedicated page for some pixel-peeping pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recorder in HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4 records video in 720p resolution at 30 fps. That?s quite something as an upgrade to the 3GS. Clips are stored in .MOV format. The big letdown is the lack of a video resolution setting. We?re not even gonna mention SloMo or Time Lapse videos. We?re talking about giving the user the simple choice between HD and VGA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the actual video quality is quite good though. The framerate is very consistent. Perhaps the iPhone 4 could use some sort of digital image stabilization to keep handshake under control, but we suppose it?s too much to ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video clips are only accessible from the gallery. They can be sent over email, MMS or directly uploaded on YouTube. Here is an untouched 720p video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two 720p video samples uploaded to YouTube:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recorded clips can also be trimmed straight on the phone. It?s as basic as it gets: a thumbable filmstrip for you to set the start and end of the trim. You can quickly preview the part of the clip you?re about to trim. But the best thing is you can overwrite your current clip or save it as a new one (the iPhone OS 3 didn?t give you a choice).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can edit movies with iMovie too, but it?s a paid app exclusively available for the iPhone 4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the promising features of the iPhone 3.0 OS was enabling third-party developers to create apps that communicate with accessories or peripherals over a USB or Bluetooth connection. We didn?t see many results from that but might just get a boost from the new iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4 is Bluetooth v2.1 enabled with A2DP for streaming music to a compatible stereo Bluetooth headset or speakers. Bluetooth file transfers are not available. Peer-to-peer connections over Wi-Fi, and even Bluetooth, are a way around this but they only work between iPhones. Bluetooth connectivity also includes support for Bluetooth keyboards much like on the Apple iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest iPhone 4 supports Wi-Fi b/g/n standards. Though we didn?t have a Wireless N router for testing, we can happily confirm that the Wi-Fi connection is much faster than that of the iPhone 3G over a G connection. What?s more, if you press your palm against the iPhone 4 Wi-Fi antenna ? the metal strip on the upper left hand side of the phone ? you even get a signal boost. That?s exactly the opposite to the issue we?re having with the cell signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tethering over USB or Bluetooth is also enabled. Just hit the on switch and choose connection type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, there?s no sign of the rumored USB file transfer feature that was supposed to be available in desktop iTunes dubbed as File Sharing. We first heard of it a month ago based on a beta version of the iOS 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4 has quad-band GSM and HSPA support, with download speed of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload of up to 5.76 Mbps.The iPhone 3GS didn?t have HSUPA support, so uploading content with the iPhone 4 over the cellular network should be times faster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Faster Safari with Google suggestions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 4?s Safari browser has been updated too. Of course it inherits all the previous upgrades from the iPhone OS 3.0: auto-fill and password manager, Copy Link and Open in New Page options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two new additions are Google Suggestions and bookmark suggestions in the address bar. Google Suggestions is self-explanatory: it?s the same as on any desktop browser. The regular address bar suggestions now covers not only your browser history, but also bookmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Safari web browser is very fast on the iPhone 4, with fluid scrolling and pinch-zooming, and excellent loading speeds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The few default apps aren?t enough to make the iPhone the ultimate organizer, but they will do well to get you started ? the AppStore will take care of the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS calendar looks much like its average competitors ? you can create and sync different calendars (Google and Outlook for example). Then you can add various events with alerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we still miss in the Calendar is landscape view and week view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The typical Notes, Calculator, Voice Recorder, Stock and Weather apps are onboard too. By the way, the new Calculator icon ? it?s a total WinMo 6.5 rip-off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Clock app you also get World Clock, Alarm, Stopwatch and Timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The free Apple?s iBooks app is not pre-installed, but you can get it for free from the AppStore. This e-reading app comes with one complimentary book ? Winnie The Pooh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iBooks offers various font and color settings, but on screen this size, it?s just not the best e-reading experience. Pages are side-scrollable only and on a mobile phone that doesn?t quite make sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iBooks is also a PDF viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally there is the mobile YouTube app to make up for the missing Flash video support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS: Google maps and a compass<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s Google Maps again and this means the iPhone 4 doesn?t offer proper SatNav out of the box. You know what we?re gonna say next then ? AppStore. At least Google Maps have the benefit of a fully integrated magnetometer (digital compass).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year many full-featured sat-nav applications made their way to the App Store ? iGO, TomTom, Navigon, etc. Every one of them will satisfy the average Joe. A SatNav capable iPhone with a proper car kit is a good enough replacement of any standalone navigation solution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>#1 AppStore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The AppStore is the place to browse, buy and download all available third-party applications available for the iPhone platform. There are both free and paid apps with detailed descriptions and screenshots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User ratings will help you decide which ones are worth it or which not. There are also numerous web sites that do app reviewing with videos and everything, so you can get pretty much all the information on any of the available apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pick and download apps via iTunes and next time you sync your iPhone, you get all the applications on board. Since iTunes 9 you can also rearrange your homescreens using the desktop software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If for some reason you need to reset your iPhone, the licenses for the paid applications are not lost, and you can freely download and install them again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AppStore has an effective app update system to push all new goodies available for your currently installed software. If an app has been updated you will be notified with a red badge on the AppStore icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple introduced in April a new advertising service for the AppStore called iAd. It launches today (1 July) and offers inline multimedia advertisements for AppStore applications. We?re not quite sure how bugging the new iAd system will be in everyday use, but at least it holds a promise for getting us some interesting, but free ad-supported apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple AppStore is currently the largest official repository of mobile phone apps with more than 200 000 titles available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We would be lying if we told you we don?t like iPhone 4. Quite the opposite, the iPhone 4 has a way to impress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4 is not the perfect smartphone but you?ll be inclined to believe it?s the perfect product. It can?t be just how they market it, or can it? Apple is great at giving people what they want, but even better at telling them what they get is the best for them. The iPhone still has very important features missing, some software and multimedia limitations and an annoying iTunes dependency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But come a new iPhone launch, and you?ll still see people putting up tents at Apple Stores to be the first to get one. Even if they hear about easily breakable glass panels and some bizarre reception issues, they?ll still want to get one and learn to hold it right (or buy some Bumper cases).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 4 will probably outsell the older generations and there are good reasons for that. It?s just gotten sexier, flaunts a killer screen, incomparably better imaging and a blazing fast CPU. Apple offers great support for their products and usually takes good care everything runs smoothly on every iPhone. It?s also got one of the richest application markets out there. The AppStore turns Apple handhelds into unsurpassed entertainment centers ? games, social networking, video and imaging, silly pranks or whatever ? the heaps of available apps fighting for your dollar are changing how we use mobile phones in our daily lives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do understand the millions of people out there who are less than impressed with the iPhone concept. Apple-imposed software limitations are stupid, even unfair at times, and their phones lack the flexibility you may be used to on other devices. The iPhone 4 is ridiculously expensive too ? 630 euro for the 16GB iPhone and 740 euro for the 32GB version. No matter how you look at it, it?s the most expensive GSM smartphone on the market right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For this kind of money, you can get whatever high-end handset you lay your eyes on. And competition is probably at its fiercest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The newly released Samsung I9000 Galaxy S is the first device to go head-to-head with the new iPhone. Samsung?s Super AMOLED screen, similar hardware and camera plus the great Android OS v2.1 inside are just the start of the Galaxy S feature list. It?s exactly the phone for those who don?t like being told what they can or cannot do with their devices. Yes, its plastic case makes it feel cheaper, but there?s no denying that the Galaxy S IS less expensive than the iPhone 4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9000 Galaxy S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are interested in more high-end Droids, you should definitely check out the HTC Desire and Google Nexus One. The Desire enjoys the great HTC Sense UI, while the Nexus One has already been updated to Android v2.2 Froyo for a performance boost and native Flash support. HTC Desire should also get a bump to 720p video recording via a software upgrade before the end of the year. Stateside, a monster of a phone is about to make Android even more compelling. The lethal Motorola DROID X boasts a massive 4.3&#x2033; high-res screen at and a top-of-the-line imaging package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Desire ? Google Nexus One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N8 should be released this quarter and, given the reported iPhone 4 market shortages, it might just land in time for the big show. It brings the revamped Symbian^3, a nice capacitive AMOLED screen and the hottest feature of all ? 12 megapixel camera with Carl-Zeiss-certified optics and Xenon flash. Oh, there is 720p video recording too. Nokia N8 is an excellent package and it will be offered at the very tempting price of 370 euro (before taxes). That?s almost half the iPhone 4 price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N8</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there?s the iPhone 3GS, which some of you may consider if your local iPhone carrier can give you a good deal. Buying last year?s Apple tech is a good enough way of getting the iPhone experience. Software-wise, the iPhone 3GS is nearly the same as the iPhone 4. Here's a rundown of the advantages the iPhone 4 has over the 3G - they're all hardware-related.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iPhone 4 advantages over iPhone 3GS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, to wrap it all up ? we admit we enjoyed the company of Apple?s latest toy and we would like to keep it around. We wouldn?t mind a Samsung Galaxy S either to watch some movies or a Nokia N8 to take some cool pictures and videos. And we wouldn?t say no to a Moto DROID X that gets along with European networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No, there isn?t a perfect smartphone out there. There?s always something for anyone to love or hate. What makes the iPhone so special is that it takes love and hate with the loftiness of a royalty.</paragraph>
