			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A trimmed-down version of the Bond phone or a remake of the Xperia Arc, the Sony Xperia J knows looks are important to reasonable spenders, too, and doesn't get carried away with the level of equipment. What it offers over a very similarly equipped Sony Xperia miro is a bigger and higher-res screen, which sure sounds like the right thing to get users interested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of that, the Xperia J has borrowed design cues from the current flagship and an old-time favorite, the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc. So, although Sony has pretty good coverage of the low-to-midrange market, the Xperia J is easily an attention-grabber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may have lost count of all the Xperia droids released over the past year - less than a year actually, which is quite impressive - but the Xperia J isn't likely to slip under your radar if you're on the market for an affordable smartphone. The J is a sensible package with an important advantage over similarly equipped and similarly priced competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No deals are perfect in this price range, which on the other hand is brimming with offerings, so the Xperia J will have to consistently show the right attitude. Sony gave the screen and design probably its best shot within the budget but there's more to a smartphone than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, that's what we are going to explore today. We'll start with the design and build as usual, before we move on to Ice Cream Sandwich and what kind of performance and features you can expect of the Xperia J.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Xperia J<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia J is trying to stick to a budget, so you shouldn't expect any special treats in the retail package. All the basics are covered though. The phone comes with the usual A/C adapter, a USB cable that's used for both charging and data connections, and a single-piece headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia J 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is the place to get the best view of the Xperia J and enjoy the subtle inward curve that is the defining design element of no other but Sony's current flagship, the Xperia T. The Xperia J is clearly smaller than the Bond phone, which is hardly a surprise considering the difference in screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of size, the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc is a much better reference. The two phones have a nearly identical footprint and weigh the same. However, the Xperia J fails to match the Arc's super slim waistline. It bets instead on practicality, with a plain but comfortable fingerprint-proof finish.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The plain-looking, angular front is in tune with Sony's current design language and you may struggle to tell the Xperia J apart from some of its siblings by simply comparing photos. One telling difference - which will be felt in daily use too - is the location of the capacitive controls. They're almost at the very bottom of the phone's front and thus a little less comfortable to reach without compromising the secure grip on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad thing is the low position of the capacitive keys hasn't minimized the bezel. As most Sony smartphones, the Xperia J doesn't make the best use of the available space. The device looks taller than the screen size requires, and isn't impressively thin either. We didn't expect anything super slim for the asking price anyway, and we're perfectly happy with the looks and feel of the Xperia J. The fingerprint prone front is par for the course with smartphones these days anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curved body is certainly one of Xperia J key features, in that it makes a neat, all-plastic phone get a bit of personality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the earpiece, the front VGA camera and a tiny status LED next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are the capacitive Back, Home and Menu keys, which light up briefly as you unlock the screen but the backlighting is otherwise off until you tap on one of them. There's no setting to change that behavior and the lack of an ambient light sensor means they wonâ??t illuminate automatically. The keys are haptic enabled, producing short sharp vibrations upon a tap. The mic pinhole is just below the Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side of the Xperia J we find the Lock/Power key, the slim volume rocker and a slit to lift up and release the battery cover. The power/lock button is tiny and has very poor press feedback. The thin volume rocker on the other hand is comfortably curved for touch orientation and reasonably solid to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side features the microUSB port only, serving both for charging and computer connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Xperia J has only the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is completely bare, save for a hidden LED right where the chrome frame meets the slanting bottom edge of the front. It glows for a few seconds each time you unlock your Xperia J, matching the currently selected color theme and will also activate on some social events â?? the tiny status LED next to the earpiece is in charge of all the other notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Xperia J looks neat and practical, and we think the soft rubbery finish is way better than the glossy back of the Xperia arc, not only in terms of looks but hand feel too. The 5MP camera lens and the LED flash are in the top left corner, with the Xperia logo centrally placed in the top half and the loudspeaker grille at the very bottom. There is a lanyard eyelet in the bottom right corner too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the battery cover you'll spot the 1750 mAh battery, the microSD slot and the SIM compartment. The memory card slot might look hot-swappable, but the battery stands in the way and won't let you insert or eject a card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia J fared impressively well in our dedicated battery test, scoring an endurance rating of 50h. This means that you'll only need to charge the smartphone every other day if you use it for an hour of talk-time, an hour of web browsing and an hour of video-watching per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good display but no Bravia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia J features a 4-inch LCD of FWVGA resolution (854 x 480 pixels), and pixel density of 245ppi. It's not a Reality display though, which means that it comes without the Mobile BRAVIA Engine. That may be a software tweak but it has its impact on photo browsing and video watching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto brightness is not available either, meaning you will have to work harder to get the best out of a screen that otherwise offers more resolution than usual for the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen images are reasonably crisp, with lively colors and quite impressive contrast. Viewing angles are quite poor though: the colors get washed out rather quickly and contrast is drastically deteriorating. The latter will be certainly appreciated by people who care about their privacy, but might make sharing your screen slightly harder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the Sony Xperia J did in our dedicated display tests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling the Xperia J<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia J is neither impressively slim, nor does it boast some exceptional finish, but we found it to be quite comfortable to handle and the curved design is a statement on its own in the budget class. What we're not so happy about is the fingerprint-prone front and the low position of the capacitive keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The absence of a camera key is, sadly, becoming the norm, even for way more expensive smartphones. The non-hot-swappable memory card is an inconvenience as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia J runs Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich out of the box and, as usual, it's covered head to toe by the custom skin that Sony uses. The smartphone is one of the lucky ones to get the Jelly Bean promotion next year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, we've shot the user interface on video for your viewing pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia J has the usual five-pane homescreen configuration, but there is no option to add or remove panes. There are four docked shortcuts (two on either side of the launcher shortcut). These are visible on all five homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The folders show thumbnails of the first four items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen does a neat trick called Overview mode. Pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition. All active widgets gather there for easy viewing and selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia J has some custom-made Sony widgets in addition to the standard set. Those include the Timescape widget (there's a dedicated app too) and a Mediascape-like widget for photos and videos (the actual app isn't there anymore, the standard gallery is back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool new addition to the lockscreen, missing from the Xperia phones of old, is the music player widget, which lets you control music playback without unlocking the phone. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area and task switcher are of course present and accounted for - no custom touches to them. For some reason the notification area isn't accessible from the lockscreen as it usually is on ICS (and on other ICS-running Xperia phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is very familiar and hasn't changed much through the years. Here are a few snapshots.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia J is powered by a Qualcomm MSM7227A chipset, which packs a 1GHz ARM Cortex-A5 processor, 512MB of RAM and Adreno 200 GPU. That's one of the lowest-powered still available Qualcomm chipset on the market, but it's quite common within the low-end class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CPU performance is quite poor. That also results in a rather choppy UI navigation, which is probably the worst thing about the Xperia J. The Xperia J CPU does better than lower-clocked Cortex-A5 designs, if that's any consolation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BenchmarkPi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu and Quadrant gives the smartphone an all-round grade for processing (calculative and graphic, memory speed, SD card writing, etc).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 200 GPU is an old design and FWVGA resolution seems to push it a bit too hard. Still, with a NenaMark 2 result of about 20fps, the Xperia J should do okay in casual 3D games, but don't expect the top-shelf titles to work. We actually tried the free game Dead Trigger and it ran well, so the Xperia J will still do the job in most of the games currently available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing performance seems to be the problem in the Xperia J though, you can improve it if you use Chrome instead of the stock Android browser (which crashes occasionally when the RAM goes full).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected, the Xperia J is hardly a benchmark champion. Its chipset is not even enough to provide a smooth ride through the interface and results in the occasional hiccup. It does okay for non-demanding tasks and things might get better when Jelly Bean comes, however.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The visually customized phonebook of the Xperia J is virtually the same as the Xperia sola's and can store extensive information for an unlimited number of contacts. A tabbed interface allows you to access contact details, recent calls and info from social networking services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (you can fine-sift specific groups from an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields assigned (and repeat fields of the same type), there's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia J was trouble-free. Its phone app features smart dialing - it searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. There's voice dialing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Xperia J automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad on the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list. You can hide the keypad the make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard threaded layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that as well. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia J offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable - the screen is big enough to house decently sized keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It works the same as Swype. Even if you've never used Swype input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Album is your gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia J comes with the new Sony gallery, called Album, which is now available on most Ice Cream Sandwich Xperia smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a whole new interface where images are arranged into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can also opt to show all of your albums in one place. There are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab - you can use pinch gestures to make the thumbnails bigger or smaller. Map reminds us of the iOS gallery, where all pictures with a Geo-tag are shown on a map of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab uses pictures from the connected online services - Google Picasa, Facebook, etc. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos much like you did with the previous Xperia Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images in both galleries can be cropped or rotated. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has added a new video player as well. It's dubbed Movies and it too has a completely redesigned interface. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies you have preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Codec support is almost non-existent - you can play MP4 and 3GP files. DivX and XviD videos were a no go and so were AVI files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download a video player off the Google Play Store with support for more video codecs but chances of getting a high-res video to play smoothly are pretty slim.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Coming to complete the trio of redesigned Sony apps is the new Walkman music player. It retains all the functionality of the older music players but adds a little bit extra here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is divided into Playing and My music panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by type - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook buddies' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, the only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Walkman player offers support for customizable equalizer settings, giving die-hard audiophiles the chance to fiddle around with the individual EQ bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the rest of the music player is the same as what we saw on Sony Ericsson handsets, this one adds music controls to the lockscreen. They replace the clock, which might be annoying if you just want to check the time. Still, the clock slides out of view, so you have about a second to see what time it is (or just look at the small clock in the upper right corner).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia J is equipped with an FM radio, which has a neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places "notches" on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service is also available and works within the radio app. You can even like a song on Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier the Xperia miro got only average scores, and imperfect frequency response. All this combined with the poor volume adds up to a mediocre overall performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is there's little degradation when headphones come into play. Stereo crosstalk rises only a little, but remains quite good. Remarkably, the distortion actually goes down and is better than many other smartphones we have seen. A pretty good performance for this case, and it would have been excellent if it wasn't for the very low volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see them for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The 5MP camera does OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia J has a 5 megapixel auto-focus snapper and coupled with a single LED flash. It's capable of producing stills with a resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface features two taskbars on either side of the viewfinder. On the left you get four shortcuts to various settings, while the still camera/camcorder toggle, the virtual shutter and a thumbnail of the last photo taken are on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu key brings up two pages of extra settings - scenes, resolution, smile detection, geotagging, image stabilization and focus mode among others. You can customize three of the shortcuts on the left (the shooting mode shortcut is fixed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five capture modes to choose from: Normal, Scene recognition and Sweep Panorama. In Normal, you pick the Scene settings manually or you can enable Scene recognition and let the Xperia J take a guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sweep Panorama is business as usual - you press the shutter key and pan the phone across the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is decent. There is plenty details and lively colors on the close-ups, but our unit had some kind of issue which prevented it from focusing properly on anything more than a few meters away. Even switching the focus mode to infinity didn't help, but we are hopping this is some kind of unit-specific issue and not something that every Xperia J user should worry about. You'd do well to check your unit before you buy it, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Image quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard test shots from the Xperia J are in our Photo Compare Tool database. The tool's page will tell you how to work it and what to look for.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia J captures VGA video at around 27 fps, which is all we can expect from an Android smartphone with such specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder has the same interface as the still camera and some of the same settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 files with a bit rate of 2 Mbps and stereo AAC sound (133Kbps, 48kHz). The resolved detail is quite decent and the videos are smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download this untouched sample VGA@27fps, taken straight off the device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia J has quad-band 2G and dual-band 3G. Mobile data speeds are boosted by 7.2Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP on hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dedicated app, Media Remote, will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. It has a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Remote app is available for free download at the Play Store so other Android smartphones can use it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The J also comes with Sony's LiveWare manager, which can be set to launch an app each time you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock ICS browser does a decent job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia J comes with the stock Android ICS browser out of the box is the updated web browser. This browser has a streamlined interface, incognito browsing and other cool features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately if you use it to browse more than half an hour in one session, it will crash due to insufficient RAM. That's the price you pay for the dated hardware. You can always switch to Google's Chrome though, which seemed to be more stable on our Xperia J unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser is quite minimalistic; all you get is the URL bar with a tabs shortcut. Hitting the Menu key you get more options - Refresh, Forward, Save to bookmarks, Share page, Find on page, full settings and a couple of more - Request desktop site (no more hunting for that "Desktop" option buried at the bottom of the site) and Save for offline reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search engine to Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser borrows several features from its desktop counterpart. For example, when searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result, it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster if you do click it. You can set this feature to work over Wi-Fi only to preserve data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other trick is Incognito mode - there's no global setting, but you can open Incognito tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, the tab switching interface looks exactly like the Recent apps list. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls (available from the Labs settings) reveal five controls (New tab, Tabs, URL, Bookmarks, More) when you slide your finger in from the side. Those really improve the browser experience. Another cool feature from Labs is Full screen, which squeezes out a little more screen real estate by hiding the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adobe already dropped the Flash support for Android and Sony isn't one of the companies to still maintain it running on its phones. So unless you find the apk from a third party store, you are out of Flash support. But even if you do, it will run terribly on the Xperia J hardware.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia J comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). The Pro version (a $15 update) can also edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable and panning is blazing fast. There's built-in file browser and cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and SugarSync).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries but you can't edit them on the phone, they are read-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit. You can expand advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Alarms app can also work as a desk clock - you have a big toggle for the brightness, as well as weather info and shortcuts to gallery slideshow and the music player. There's no world clock, stopwatch or timer though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Sony Power Saver app lets you automate certain power saving functions for your device, such as whether to dim the display or disable certain connectivity features when the battery falls below a certain level.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>You are in good hands with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia J comes with a GPS receiver, which took about two minutes to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will do if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline from the menu" and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to fit New York and some surrounding area before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play offers lots of possibilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia J runs ICS, so it has access to most of the latest apps. The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There are usually several screenshots of the app in action, and oftentimes a demo video as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Google Play Store and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.), so if you wish you could do something more with your phone, odds are it's in the app store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The styling of the company's flagship smartphone and a screen with more pixels than most people expect for the price give the Sony Xperia J a headstart over the competition. On the other hand, Sony had to make a lot of hard decisions to stay within budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's beyond doubt that many users will be drawn by the resolution and the price. And to be honest, the Xperia J isn't the kind of phone people would research at length. The typical Xperia J user is more likely coming from a feature phone, or an entry-level droid at best. A 4" FWVGA screen and excellent build will make enough difference to them. They'll be right on the upgrade highway. That's two compromises they no longer have to make to meet their budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, there we go, a point on the Xperia J's score sheet. But as we said, it has to tick as many boxes as it can to be successful in a highly competitive segment of the smartphone market. Let's see how the rivals are going about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've had a similar experience with the LG Optimus L7 and the HTC Desire V - both great-looking smartphones but a bit underpowered. They are is based on the same chipset, comes with a similar display - WVGA (480 x 800) on a 4.3" or 4" diagonal. They even costs about the same.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The only other way to get a 4" WVGA screen on a recent midrange droid (former flagships and last season's upper midrangers don't count) is the Samsung Galaxy Ace 2. And that still is technically less resolution than the Xperia J's. The Ace 2 costs notably more than the Xperia J though and while it does offer better performance and HD video, it's still waiting for a post-Gingerbread update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Ace 2 I8160</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while the Xperia J might be able to withstand the attacks of those listed above, we can't help but notice that this it's not offering the best-bang for buck within its own family. The Xperia U costs the same as the J, matches its resolution and offers more than twice the processing power. The catch here is that it has a smaller screen and only has 6GB of non-expandable storage. Solving that final issue might require you to reach just a little bit deeper in your pocket and get the Xperia sola - we find the price premium on that one to be more than worth it on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia U ? Sony Xperia sola</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So while the high-res screen helps the Xperia J stand-out among rivals in its price bracket, the compromises involved are a bit hard to swallow. Sure, not everyone is a power user and needs multi-core CPUs or HD video recording, but we'd prefer to spend a few bucks more than live with the lag any day of the week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not so much criticism to the Xperia J itself, as for the whole class of devices in its price range currently. Those find themselves way too close to the NovaThor dual-cores to be worth the savings they incur. You are better off either going even lower and saving some significant cash (even if you will be making even more compromises) or reaching for the shelf just above this one and get a properly powered smartphone.</paragraph>
