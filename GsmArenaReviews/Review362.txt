			<paragraph>Nokia 6300 is the new Nokia star in the Series 40 3rd Edition line. It attacks with conservative design, miniUSB, and a slim body with steel plates.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>  &nbsp;      Nokia 6300  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The famous Finnish mobile manufacturer has been long expected to launch a new high-end, classic-look phone with state-of-the-art functional menu to substitute the enormously successful couple Nokia 6230 and Nokia 6230i. The first try in this sense came a year and a few months ago with the presentation of Nokia 6233. However, its rounded body was accepted rather coldly by common users. Until today, when we meet Nokia 6300, the model many proclaim to be the real successor of Nokia 6230/6230i. Reasons are numerous. Nokia 6300 has a modern slim look, not spoilt by unnecessary decorative elements, a highly functional menu, and brilliant keypad and display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;      The 6300 held in hand ? size comparison to a key and a credit card  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia has also gone on a diet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Slim phones are fashionable these days. Quite understandable, isn?t it? Who would prefer to carry a device that fills up their pocket with an unpleasant bulge? Obviously, Nokia has also had to go on a diet as this new model is 6 mm thinner than Nokia 6233. Here are all its parameters: 106 x 44 x 12 mm. Nokia 6300 weighs merely 91g, which, given its steel plates, is another admirable achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6300 comes in a decent black &amp; silver combination. Everything that is silver is made of steel. Black areas are made of glossy plastic material. The display and the functional part of the keypad are located inside a black frame that stands out over the surrounding surface a little. As a result of this, Nokia 6300 notably resembles Nokia 3230.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 3230 ? similar, indeed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone construction benefits a lot from the significant amount of metal material used on it as these make it extremely solid. Nokia 6300 did not give out a single creak, not even under strong pressure. The battery cover fit in perfectly too. Yet, glossy materials have also been applied, which brings along inevitable drawbacks: fingerprints remain visible on almost the entire phone surface. And then if your hands tend to sweat excessively, you may not even manage to ever clean your mobile. Fingerprints are clearly seen on the keypad, the display, and all plates. &nbsp;</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Illumination alerts of all important events<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Due to Nokia 6300?s slimness, its sides lack many control elements. The left side, in particular, is absolutely bare. On the right you will find a dual volume control button, only functional if pressed strongly or moved by one?s nail. The camera control button is not situated here, because the rear plate of the phone covers the sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       All-side view at Nokia 6300  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>On both sides, where the rear plate finishes and the dark bottom surface begins, are located two oblong info LEDs covered by white plastic material. They alert you about missed calls or received messages by blinking in expressed blue. If necessary, the LEDs can be deactivated from the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;     A LED on each side of the body  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top of the body you will see a switch-off button, which can also be used for fast switch between ringing profiles. And here comes the main surprise hidden in the bottom: a standard miniUSB connector instead of Pop-port (used by Nokia in almost all previous models). The advantages are more than obvious: any cable, even a digital camera one will be enough to establish a connection between Nokia 6300 and a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      The bottom side of the phone with its USB connector ? with a stubborn protecting cap ? switch-off button  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The miniUSB connector is protected by a solid cap that fits so perfectly and holds so firmly, that at the beginning of the tests it took us some time to find out how to open it. Opening the cap is a rather problematic process and it could really create difficulties during the first few weeks of usage of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;      Simultaneous connection of both earphones and charger ? earphones of average quality  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the miniUSB connector, in the bottom you will also find two round slots. The smaller one serves the charger, while the wider one is a 2.5mm audio jack used for connecting the headset. It is a pity that Nokia did not elaborate a connector by a millimeter wider so that any type of earphones could be plugged in. The other two oblong slots are made for a microphone and a wrist band (the latter gets hooked onto a projection beneath the rear cover).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Your name on the rear plate<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The rear plate offers little interesting. Its top part is made of black plastics, in which the glass of a 2 megapixel camera is mounted. The camera lens is framed in white and slightly embedded for protection. We recommend that the lens is polished and fingerprints are cleaned before every use of the camera. A Nokia logo is located above the camera, while on its right there are 9 round holes that let the sound of the loudspeaker out. Unlike Nokia 6233, Nokia 6300 has no stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;       Camera lens is not protected ? next by it is the loudspeaker grill  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the rear plate consists of solid steel battery cover, on which anything ? from a phrase to a graphic logo- can be engraved. For example, our tester phone is decorated with MobilMania?s website. For the moment, however, it is not clear what the cost of this service will be. We have been told that it would be offered free to the first 50 customers by key mobile retailers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     You can have any kind of text or logo engraved on the rear plate of the phone  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear plate is easy to remove even though it sets in pretty firmly. Hidden under it is a BL-4C type Li-Ion battery with a capacity of 860 mAh. According to Nokia official website it is able to provide power for 210 minutes of calling time or 348 hours of stand-by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, our guess is that no matter how little you use the phone, you will need to charge it every second or third day. The SIM card lies (not too firmly) in a bed under the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      The rear cover removed ? memory card slot beneath the rear plate  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6300 has a memory card slot located under the rear plate, on the left ? a happy solution allowing memory card changing without switching off the device. The slot is for microSD cards; one such of 128 MB capacity is directly available with the purchase of the phone, whose internal memory is otherwise rather limited (approximately 7.5 MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Palatine keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad in Nokia 6300 is divided into two parts located in two levels. The functional keys are situated about 2 millimeters higher than the numerical ones, which, however, has no negative impact on control comfort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     Numerical keys could have been expressed better in order to facilitate touch orientation  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric part of the keypad consists of one block of keys without spaces. The keys alone are big enough, respond surely to pressing, accompanied by a quiet click. Typing becomes comfortable once you get used to the vague touch feedback. The keys are made of silver plastic material; however, their footing to the base could have been better. When you pass your finger across the keypad, keys wobble a bit. Keys legends are well and evenly illuminated in blue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Functional keys are pretty small ? numerical keys do not stand out of the surrounding surface  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6300?s main control element is a four-way navigation key with a confirming center. The latter is spacey and easy to press; it is surrounded by a silver, a little bit elevated frame, which activates each of the four ways. Even though the frame is not much wide, its uplift makes usage seamless. The navigation key features no backlighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     Superb even backlighting  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the navigation key are situated four well known buttons: two for initiating and terminating calls and two context ones. They are rather small, but the space around them is large enough so errors are rather rare. All four buttons have identical size; their differentiating element is the color of the tiny rectangle located inside each key.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Enchanting display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia has equipped the 6300 model with a truly spectacular TFT display capable of visualizing the incredible 16.7 millions of colors. It offers a QVGA resolution of 240 x 320 pixels on a surface of 31 x 41 mm, which results in superbly fine images; individual pixels are not visible to the human eye. Add especially deep and true colors and high-quality backlighting and you will manage to imagine what satisfactory experience any look at the display is. Pictures look gorgeous. The display is perfectly legible under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;     Display is large enough  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neither backlighting, nor contrast is user-configurable. In the menu you can only set up what should happen, if the phone is left inactive. An animated screen-saver can be set up to appear on the display and consequently convert into a screen-saver with a digital clock, the corresponding date, and with icons indicating missed events if any. All these details are perfectly legible in any light condition. In the menu you will also find a sleeping mode option, when the display goes out completely. Not even with a dark display, however, will you miss a single event as the informative LEDs on the sides alert you of all those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Superb image and visualization quality  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface and control: quality proven plenty of times<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are no surprises here. Nokia 6300, alike plenty other Nokia siblings, is built on Series S40 3rd Edition user interface. In other words, neither the menu, nor the control of the phone differs in any way from those in other Nokia models based on the same platform. You will be pleasantly surprised by the broad user-configurable options of the phone; the drawback is that these make the menu structure somewhat complicated and hard to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Various views at the stand-by display ? active stand-by mode is available too  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When on stand-by, the display visualizes not only the pre-selected wallpaper, but in the top bar you can also monitor signal strength, battery state, time, and the icons of any other currently activated functions. Beneath the top bar are the operator name and the date. The bottom bar is reserved for the descriptions of the functions assigned to the center of the navigation key and to the two context keys. The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The left key is pre-set to serve the Go to menu, where you can insert all your favorite or most used items. The font on the main display can be of any color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>User-configuration options do not end here, though. Each way of the navigation key can also start any function. Besides, the functions assigned to them can be displayed in the form of a cross with icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;       All four visualization modes of the main menu  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is hard to imagine a Nokia phone without an active stand-by mode nowadays. The one implemented in Nokia 6300 consists of several parts that can be edited or relocated in various ways. In the standard case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions indicated by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player and the built-in radio. In the very bottom are displayed events from the calendar corresponding to the current day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu in Nokia 6300 can be visualized in four ways: a matrix with icons with or without legends, a list of items, and strips. According to our opinion, the best of them all is the matrix without legends, because it is the only visualization form that allows for all 11 icons to be displayed simultaneously. The legend of the active icon is displayed in the top left corner. The icons are designed with style; the active icon is animated. Icons can be freely re-ordered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Lower menu level  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other menu levels are miscellaneous. Some legends are accompanied by an icon, others are not. In certain cases you will be able to see selected item described in small font so you will not need to step further into another menu level. As usual, the menu items are accessible through keyboard shortcuts. The color background of the entire menu as well as the wallpaper on the display can be easily modified by applying one of the 5 pre-installed profiles. More profiles can be downloaded from WAP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu responds promptly, without delays. It offers a highly practical, intelligent voice control, which does not require pre-recording of one?s own voice labels and, at the same time, can be used for the activation of numerous functions. The firmware of the phone can be user-updated straight from the corresponding GSM network. New versions are downloaded Over-The-Air and immediately installed, so you need no PC for this purpose.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera makes a huge step backwards<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6300 has a 2 megapixel camera considered a standard in all mobiles of this price category. The highest image resolution is 1200 x 1600 pixels. Whatsoever, the camera is rather disappointing: it has neither autofocus, nor flash or lens cap. The glass protecting the lens is only slightly embedded, but even so it could hardly be scratched. What it will suffer from, however, will be your fingerprints, and so make sure you polish it before every use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;     Camera view-finder and its menu ? video camera view-finder  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When photographing, you should hold Nokia 6300 in a vertical position; pictures are oriented vertically too, both characteristics being rather uncomfortable. Since the phone lacks a side release button, this is substituted by the center of the navigation key. The view-finder uses the entire display; resulting images are not cropped. Photo quality is average; when the weather is favorable, images come out pretty well, sharp enough, with less deep colors. The noise levels are high in areas with no detail like the sky for example. Given the absence of autofocus, you?d rather not take picture of closely situated objects of text, as they will surely be blurred. Text is only legible if captured from distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sample photos taken with the built-in camera: </paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;     &nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;      8x digital zoom reduces image size to 240 x 320 pixels  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Night mode is handy  </paragraph>
			<paragraph> Demonstration of color effects: </paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera options are standard. There is an 8x zoom, which, if used, shrinks photos to a resolution of 320 x 240 pixels. Further on in the menu you can set up the white balance and general image quality, activate the self-release function, burst mode, or night mode. There are five color effects, as well. Where you will save your ready photos - in the phone memory or on the memory card ? is up to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the phone, pictures can be viewed in fullscreen mode, they can be cropped or you can add various designs, frames, and text to them. They can also be easily sent out to another device via Bluetooth or printed out via PictBridge. Inside the Gallery application the address structure of the internal phone memory is fully separated from the one of the memory card. Nonetheless, you should have no difficulties to move files or organize them into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       The gallery serves as a file manager ? two preview modes ? viewing images in fullscreen mode  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest disappointment for us was the miserable video resolution of mere 176 x 144 pixels. We expected Nokia 6300 to manage video records in VGA resolution, just as its colleague Nokia 6233, but it does not, unfortunately. The length of videos in 3GP format is only limited by the free memory available. Zoom can be applied during the recording process.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: no need of video calls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the main differences between Nokia 6300 and Nokia 6233 is the absence of 3G network support in the first. Nokia 6300 only operates in GSM networks at 900/1800/1900 MHz (850/1900/1800 MHz in the version for the Americas). The quality level of the other telephonic functions is traditionally high. Everything is just like in any other phone built on Series 40 3rd edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook offers space for 1000 names as well as various configuration options. Each contact can be assigned plenty of fields; for example, 5 phone numbers, email address, website, and street address; birth date, company, working position, and nickname. First names are separated from last names eliminating problems when the phone is synchronized with Outlook. Contacts can be differentiated using various ringtones as well as accompanied by a special image and video during incoming calls. Sound is good. A loud speaker and a voice recorder are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Two view modes within the phonebook ? contact details and its editing  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can show only the contacts saved in the phone memory or only those stored on the SIM card, or both list simultaneously. Searching any of them is made by gradual typing of the name of the corresponding contact. The phonebook can be displayed as a simple list of names, as a list of names with numbers, or as a list of names with their assigned images. Users with sight problems will surely appreciate the option for font enlargement. And that?s not all: contacts can also be organized in groups and these can consequently be used as call filters. Another application worth our complements is voice dial; no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Phonebook menu ? call groups ? editing a ringing profile  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing profiles offer extensive user-configuration options. Nokia 6300 offers 7 profiles, each of which allows you to set up ringtones, Push-to-talk sounds, vibrations, message alert tones, and key tones. The profiles also help you to filter incoming calls. What?s more, each profile can be activated temporarily, with a pre-set expiry time. One of the profiles is called Airplane; its activation cuts off all network functions of the phone. The rest of the functions remain active. Identical situation is created when Nokia 6300 is switched on without a SIM card. The phone rings in 64-voice polyphony or using files in MP3, AAC, WMA, and AMR formats.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The message menu has not undergone any modifications, either. It is organized almost perfectly. Besides standard text messages, Nokia 6300 receives and sends multimedia messages, sound messages via MMS, instant messages straight to display, and emails. Message type is selected before their creation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Message menu ? received messages list ? reading a SMS displayed in the smallest and the largest font  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As soon as you activate the SMS editor, it will offer you a space for the number of the recipient, which you can insert through standard typing, selecting it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with last recipients in the call register. Everything is practical and saves time. Once you have inserted the necessary number, a single press is enough to switch you to the space for text and you can start typing. The phone offers a T9 dictionary with rich vocabulary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu offers three font sizes to choose from. 10 lines in the smallest available font fit onto the display at a time when messages are typed. If you use the largest font, then you will see 6 lines. Messages are read on 12 and 7 lines according to the applied font, respectively. A message can be a maximum 1000 characters long. Both the number of typed characters and the number of sub-messages are constantly visible. All messages use shared memory, independently on their type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Message type selection ? creating SMS using the largest font  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite surprisingly, the phone is equipped not with one, but with two MMS editors. One is standard, identical to the editors in other recently launched Nokia models. The other one creates the so called ?multimedia messages plus?, in which any kind of file, even one in a non-compatible format, can be inserted. A photo in full resolution, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS too. MMS size limit in both editors is 300 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Two MMS editors  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is a built-in Java application, which explains its slower speed. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols. When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Automatic message download is not user-configurable. There is a simple spam filter for unsolicited mail. Sent attachments are not limited in size. Both entire messages and message headers can be downloaded as long as these, together with the attachments are no bigger than 300 KB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Time organizer: exquisite calendar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer hasn?t undergone any modifications, either, as it is brilliant. The calendar offers month, week, and day views. Calendar week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. There are five types of events: appointment, call, birth date, note, and reminder. Further, each type of event has its own specific fields like starting and end time, type of alert with various advance intervals, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly repetition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Organizing functions menu ? alarm clock ? task manager ? task editing  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of as well as marked off once accomplished. They are easily moved into the calendar application. Text notes can be written down as well; their length limit is 3000 characters. The alarm clock is repeated; it can be set up to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. If you prefer, Nokia 6300 will even wake you up with your favorite radio station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Month, week, and day views at the calendar ? event editing  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some other organizing functions available in the phone: voice recorder of 60 minute length limit, stopwatch, countdown timer, and calculator. The latter is very detailed and offers rather complicated mathematic functions, like sin and cos; nonetheless, it is still not familiar with mathematic operations priority. The folder containing Java applications located on the memory card also features an application for text communication via Bluetooth called Sensor, a state-of-the-art unit converter, and an application for remote control of PC presentations called Presenter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;       Stopwatch with mean times ? text note ? very good calculator ? time countdown  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Voice recorder ? unit converter  </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A music player from XpressMusic for all tastes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is identical to the one used in the music phone Nokia 5300. It is a brilliantly elaborated player with extensive setup options. Besides managing all functions common for a music player it also sorts songs by artist, album, genre, and composer. The player works with MP3, MID, AAC, AAC+, and WMA formats; what?s more, it supports A2DP profile and thus can play into Bluetooth wireless earphones. A more detailed description of the music player can be found in the Nokia 5300 review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;     Music player ? music library ? songs list  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Together with the phone, in the retail package you will find a Nokia HS-47 headset. The earphones quality may satisfy you as long as you do not have big expectations and you tend to use the music player rather occasionally. The earphones feature a 2.5 mm jack, so any substitution for another set of earphones is impossible without a corresponding adapter. Music features are tuned through an equalizer or by using the stereo expansion function. Nokia 6300 has only one loudspeaker located on its rear cover; its plays quite well, though. Besides, it does not get silenced when the phone body is placed on an even surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;      Integrated radio ? video player ? key legends interfere with the full-screen mode  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with MP3 files, turn on the stereo FM radio. Stations are searched automatically or by direct typing of a specific frequency. The phone can store up to 20 station names. The radio can also be listened through the loudspeaker; just make sure you have your earphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna. There is also a function called Visual Radio, but it is inapplicable in most countries; regrettably there is no RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is compatible with 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode as well as forwarded or rewinded. Yet, key legends (impossible to remove) interfere with the fullscreen mode and obstruct video playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  &nbsp;     Three pre-installed games  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Java games like all other applications are stored in an external memory card delivered with Nokia 6300. In the phone alone there are three pre-installed games: a 3G snake, a 3-dimensional, hard-to-play football game, and a Sudoku in Flash format (Nokia 6300 supports both Java MIDP2.0 and Flash). According to the results of the jBenchmark test Java interface is not of the fastest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> jBenchmark results: </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data with Opera Mini<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned earlier, Nokia 6300 does not support 3G networks. The only data technologies left in the phone are EDGE, GPRS (both of Class 10), and the archaic HSCSD. There is no Infrared port, but in these days hardly any mobile user would be troubled by its absence. The Infrared port is successfully substituted by Bluetooth and the miniUSB connector. The original retail package does not contain a data cable, but you could get yourself one without a problem due to the miniUSB connector. Once you connect the phone to a computer you will be offered three modes to choose of. Along with a synchronizing mode there is an image print mode in PictBridge standard and a USB Mass Storage for data transfers, where the memory card appears in the computer as a new hard disc. Nokia 6300 is not charged when connected through this cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;     Opera Mini also available ? WAP browser and its menu  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6300 has an integrated WAP browser, which, along with WAP 2.0, also manages HTML pages. Font size modifications are available, as usual. When set at the smallest font, the display visualizes up to 11 text lines. Strips and direct address insertion are available too. The browser is in a competition with another brilliant application ? the famous Java application Opera Mini. The latter is pre-installed and located on the memory card. Further in the retail package you will find a CD containing a brief presentation of Nokia 6300, PC Suite programs ready for installation, Adobe Photoshop Album for photo editing, and Nokia Wireless Presenter for presentation management via Bluetooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Satisfactory functions in a combination with attractive looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6300 is a good phone. Along with slim design of steel plates it also offers an especially rich functional menu, similar to the functional equipment of all other phones based on the Series 40 3rd Edition platform. It brings along broad personalization options and a great amount of working and multimedia functions. However, it is not only the design of Nokia 6300 that is worth compliments. Its 16 million color display as well as its miniUSB connector are brilliant too. Users may not like the fingerprints or the low video record resolution.</paragraph>
