			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tired of handling your smartphone with care? Want to have a flagship with all the bells and whistles but you're not good at keeping an expensive piece of equipment out of trouble? Motorola to the rescue. The Moto X Force is a shock and water-proof flagship, with high-performance hardware, an impressive camera and a clean Android experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force is the true heavyweight in the Moto X lineup. It has a 5.4" Quad HD AMOLED screen, a Snapdragon 810 chipset with 3GB of RAM, a 21MP camera with PD-AF, a massive 3,760mAh battery, and stock Android Marshmallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has always tried to meet two popular market demands: a clean Android OS with on-time updates and protection against the elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of waterproof phones on offer and this isn't the path Motorola chose for the X Force. Instead, it's covered against different, but equally likely, accidents such as cracking the screen or putting a dent in the case. In addition to the shatter-proof screen, the Moto X Force's internals feature a water-repellent nano-coating, which means it is more likely to survive accidental dips than an average handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's explore the Moto X Force in details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X Force omits the fingerprint scanner, which has been steadily making its way into the midrange, but is a feature most people can probably live without in a rugged phone. The battery sounds beefy enough even for that QHD screen, so the fact you can't swap it is at least somewhat mitigated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The important thing about the Moto X Force is it doesn't need to be handled with care and that probably lets it get away with more things than most phones would. That said, most phones are not the Moto X Force's target anyway. This one will need every bit of shatter-proofing it's got because it's really going against the flagships. What are its chances? We begin to find out right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Moto X Force<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force is packed in a rather big and fancy box, but don't be fooled by its size and looks. The TurboPower fast charger is the only thing you get other than the Moto X Force itself. And that is if you are lucky, as there are markets where the box contains nothing but the phone. There are no bundled earphones or a microUSB cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola Moto X Force 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 5.4" Moto X Force is far from compact. It measures 149.8 x 78 x 9.2mm and weighs in at a solid 170g. It's as tall as the 5.3" LG G5, but half a centimeter wider and 1.5mm thicker. It's a big and stocky bloke compared to some elegantly slim smartphones, but not unpleasantly so.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force is built to last and you can tell by the hand-feel and the solid impression the very first time you unwrap the smartphone. The matte metal frame with chamfered edges holds everything together, not without a sense of premium style. The front is quite restrained but the back is where things get interesting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard (read non-customized) model of the Moto X Force comes with a back made of the so-called ballistic nylon. It's incredibly grippy, with an excess of industrial look and feel to it, yet quite controversial in terms of a flagship-grade finish. It feels extra strong, reliable and durable but, frankly, kind of cheap. The funny part is it probably isn't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ballistic nylon won't scratch or break, as it's very durable and does a great job at absorbing shock from falls. If we are to zoom in close on this thing, we'll actually find real threads and tiny knots of it, as opposed to the faux-leather looks of what's actually plastic. You can tell this thing is far from a cheap knock-off and should work as advertised.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only real concern about the ballistic nylon is that it's prone to gathering dust and other tiny particles, which are quite tough to remove once stuck between the knots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the back is covered by a rather durable and grippy piece of ballistic nylon. The sides are made from metal. What about the front?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has shielded the entire front with a shatter-proof piece of glass and gives it a 4-year warranty. Yes, that's right - even though the standard warranty stretches only over 1 or 2 years, your front glass comes with a full 4 years worth of warranty and will be replaced if broken by an accidental drop or similar. Scratches on the glass or damage to the handset itself are not covered by the warranty, nor is the phone covered against intentional or unreasonable amounts of pressure exerted on the glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force features a water-repellent nano-coating that protects its internals from moderate exposure to water such as light rain, accidental spills or splashes. It will most probably survive a quick dip in water too, but the phone is not water-proof and Motorola clearly states that in its brochure and warranty conditions. This means no water pictures as the Moto X Force will be damaged and you won't get a new one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, Motorola protected the Moto X Force against the accidents which may occur in daily usage, but it isn't an adventurer's smartphone. It's just tough enough to survive four years, and you don't need to handle it with care as you would do with other, glass-covered competing flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking about handling, the Moto X Force offers a secure grip thanks to its ballistic nylon back and matte frame. It's solidly built, but quite chubby so single-handed operation is mostly a no-go. It slips easily in most pockets but the weight of a 5.4-incher will certainly be felt.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is nothing out of the ordinary as far as the Moto X Force controls are concerned. Above the display is the earpiece flanked by the front LED flash and the 5MP selfie snapper, while the bottom has the rather large microphone and loudspeaker grilles. We noticed that the three speaker grilles tend to collect dust and grime easily so this may become an issue in time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two infra-red sensors around the bottom grilles, very well hidden beneath the glass. Those are used to detect your hand when you reach out for your phone, so they could turn the Moto Display on, if you turned the feature on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the phone houses the audio jack and the SIM/microSD cards tray. The bottom has the lonely microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing on the left while the right is pretty busy - the power/lock key is placed above the volume rocker. This is a rather odd sequence and it took us a while to get used to clicking the power key instead of volume up/down. The good news is the lock key has a nice texture on its surface, which helps with tactility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the metal plate on the back highlights the 21MP camera lens, the dual-tone flash, and the signature M logo. As usual, the logo is indented so your index finger rests perfectly there during calls. Just don't expect to find a fingerprint scanner or a key at this place if you are coming from a Huawei or an LG phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The secondary mic hole is just above the camera, drilled in the ballistic nylon. It's camouflaged very well, but at times, it can fool your eyes it's a manufacturing imperfection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto X Force comes with a 1440p display with the unusual 5.4 inches in diagonal and visually, it's about as good as it gets. The matrix is an AMOLED one based on the Diamond PenTile pattern while the AMOLED itself guarantees sharp and punchy colors and deep blacks. With a pixel density of 540 ppi, it is very sharp too and offers great clarity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shatter-proof glass above the display is the key feature, of course, and it comes with a 4-year warranty. This means if your display glass shatters or cracks, Motorola will replace it for free. There are some limitations of course - Motorola doesn't cover scratches, or damages on the phone itself. Nor will it replace your glass if you broke it intentionally (by experimenting).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have come to associate AMOLED panels with absolute blacks and infinite levels of contrast and that fits with the nature of the technology itself. Still, with the Moto X Force, we didn't actually manage to get an absolute black reading - our colorimeter kept picking up some light. Perhaps it is some intentional software trick or a controller bug, but the blackest of blacks still clocked 0.04nits of brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, you would need to be in a pitch dark room to even get a chance of noticing this sort of light levels, but it does mean that the contrast is not infinite as on other AMOLED phones, but it rather works out to about 9432:1. As you can see, it's still times better than LCD displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panel on the Moto X Force has an expected maximum brightness level of 349nits at full blast (manual control). It can go up to 486nits though, when exposed to bright light, courtesy of the auto-brightness algorithm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola did a good job of calibrating the screen on the Moto X Force. We measured an average deltaE of 4.8, which is close to the iPhone 6s and a rather good result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the red channel to be rather off with a DeltaE of 13.2 while all other colors are well below DeltaE of 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>People use their phones more than they are willing to admit, even in the black of night. This is why the minimum brightness is important too so that you can use the phone without squinting. The Moto X Force managed to do 5.4nits at full white, which is rather low and should do OK for most people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility, definitely does not disappoint but is far from impressive. The Moto X Force remains usable even under direct sunlight though we've seen better. Its glass is a bit more reflective than we'd prefer and that's the reason for the average result for this AMOLED panel.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola has been very generous in terms of battery capacity. The Moto X Force packs up to 3,760 mAh worth of juice, but the battery itself is not user-replaceable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone supports the company's TurboPower fast charging, and most markets will get the charger within the retail package. In case you aren't among the lucky ones, you may want to buy it separately for $35/?25. Note that the Moto X Force coming without the charger in those regions will be sold at a lower price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 810 isn't exactly power-sipping, so we didn't expect chart-topping results but we still like what we got.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is good for 23.5 hours of 3G voice calls - an excellent result. In our video playback test, the Moto X Force died after a hair more than 15 hours - another excellent mark, but the Wi-Fi web browsing longevity is 'just' very good at 9 and a half hours. All that works out to a proprietary endurance rating of 78 hours. It could have been better, but the standby endurance turned out just average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you opt for the Moto Display, you'll lose 6 hours from the total endurance rating down to 72 hours. In this mode the screen doesn't stay constantly on, but the two infra-red sensors do, and, we guess, that's what's depleting the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X Force has a wide range of connectivity options. It supports quad-band 2G, penta-band 3G and a host of 4G frequencies. Cat. 6 LTE is supported for theoretical speeds of 300Mbps down and 50Mbps up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force has Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz spectrums and hotspot support. There is a GPS receiver, Bluetooth is of the 4.1 iteration, and NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB on-the-go to let you attach peripherals. A standard 3.5mm jack completes the wired connectivity package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no FM radio.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Barebone Android Marshmallow<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola Moto X Force may come with Android 5.1.1 Lollipop pre-installed out of the box, but a firmware update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow is already seeding worldwide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto phones have been famous for the Nexus-like features - free of bloatware Android OS with the original skin, and on-time firmware upgrades for at least 2 years. The lack of any customizations is the sole reason for the fast updates. Still, there are some proprietary features offered on the phone - all found within the Moto app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of those features is Moto Display. It shows notifications on a black lockscreen, which you can handle with swipes in different directions. You can't control the content that shows there. There's no "hide sensitive content" option either. You can, however, block entire apps from posting notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Display isn't an Always-On display like the ones on the Galaxy S7 or LG G5. It can be configured to light up upon hand reach or once you get it out of your pocket. There is a shortcut for unlocking the screen if needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen itself is very familiar - a clock, notifications and a couple of shortcuts (voice assistant and camera, instead of the usual phone and camera). Swiping down shows the quick toggles and the brightness slider. The camera, however, can be also triggered by double pressing the power button while the phone is asleep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing we wish stock Android would bring from the skinned implementations is the Auto brightness toggle. You would have to dig in the settings menu for that as the toggle is not available on the quick toggle dropdown. Other than that, you can pick the large-size toggles, the ones you'll use most often (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth by default). Long-pressing a toggle or hitting its down arrow brings out additional details, e.g. Wi-Fi settings and detected Wi-Fi networks respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force doesn't have a fingerprint scanner, so you'll have to rely on a PIN or a password. Luckily, Google has developed a number of ways to reduce the hassle of unlocking the device. Secure locks can be disabled in trusted situations. This can be anything from a trusted place, through a trusted device (e.g. your smartwatch) to three biometric options: your face (susceptible to doppelgangers), your voice and even your body (unlock the device once and it stays unlocked while it's on your person).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is not much going on the homescreen - the Moto X Force has one of the leanest app packages we've seen. At first, it has just a single homescreen pane and most of it is empty. Even the list of all apps fits on one screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even so, there's not as much free space as you would imagine. We have the 32GB version, the other option being 64GB, and there's only 19GB of storage left over for the user partition. About 3GB of that is taken up by the installed default applications (such as Play Store, Gmail, Maps, Play Services, among others). This leaves us to believe the core Android OS is taking some good 8GB of storage, which is quite surprising.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking is done through the app switcher, a 3D rolodex menu. You can swipe apps to dismiss them. You can also check how much RAM was used by any app in the last few hours so memory hogs are immediately visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple users are supported, you get an Owner and a Guest account to start you off. You can add more users, each with their own apps, their own wallpaper and so on. Some settings (like Wi-Fi or app updates) affect all accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Native app permissions finally landed on Android. Each app - even the pre-installed ones - will ask permission before accessing your data. Once you hit "Allow", they won't ask again (you can revoke the permission from the settings). To save you from spammy apps, the Deny option comes with a handy checkbox to make the denial permanent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Moto app, in addition to the Moto Display options, offers a bunch of other goodies. You can enable various motion gestures, which trigger different actions - shake twice for torch, keep the screen on while you are looking at it, wrist twist for quick camera capture, and lift the phone up to engage the Moto Voice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto Voice is the actual personal assistant and perhaps the coolest part about it is that you can setup a custom launch phrase like "Yo, dawg!" instead of being limited to just "Hey, Moto X!". It can do lots of important stuff such as calling, texting, checking things out for you, post to Facebook, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, the stock Android is perfectly smooth, and the fast octa-core processor with 3GB RAM is surely helped by the Marshmallow optimizations.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force packs a hefty punch with the Snapdragon 810 v2.1 chipset. The Adreno 430 pairs very nicely with the latter for a smooth UI experience. Sure, there is the newer and cooler Snapdragon 820 chip, but let's not forget that the Moto X Force originally launched late last year when the 810 was still Qualcomm's greatest mass-production SoC around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Moto X Force offers an octa-core processor with 4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.5GHz and 4x Cortex-A57 @ 2.0GHz. There are also 3 gigs of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 single-core score put the Moto X Force around the bottom of the chart as it tests a single Cortex-A53 core, which is quite outdated.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-core performance is on par with the last year's Exynos chips, but behind the S820 phones (Mi 5, G5, HTC 10). The custom Kryo cores inside those are paying off (remember, there are only four of those in a Snapdragon 820, while the Snapdragon 810 is an eight-core main processor).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compound AnTuTu benchmark puts the X Force on par with the Nexus 6P, which runs on the same chipset. The latest crop of flagships does noticeably better though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We see the same results in the compound BaseMark OS II 2.0 test. The Moto X Force is around the bottom, on par with the S810-powered G Flex2 and Galaxy S6's Exynos. The latest flagships are faster by a significant margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a newer generation of Adreno GPU already, which is better equipped to handle Quad HD resolution. Still the S810's Adreno 430 model is quite a powerful and snappy GPU and will handle the graphic-demanding tasks with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The offscreen test reveals the 30% raw power gap between the Adreno 530 (Mi 5, HTC 10, G5) and the Moto X Force's Adreno 430.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to onscreen Quad HD resolution, the Adreno 430 is actually very close to what the G5 and HTC 10 score with the newer Adreno 530. The Mi 5 is on top because it runs on 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BaseMark X puts the X Force on par with the HTC 10 and the Galaxy S6 edge+, which is odd, but proves the GPU is very capable. BaseMark ES 3.1 GPU test also shows a better result than the Nexus 6P, and not far behind the Mi 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark ES 3.1 / Metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the Motorola Moto X Force and its Snapdragon 810 provide a flagship-grade performance even though it's not chart topping. There isn't a single task the Force can't handle, and all available games to date will run hassle-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android Marshmallow runs butter-smooth, too, so there is nothing to worry about either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 810 chip was plagued by overheating issues, and while it is now in its second (improved) revision, those are still possible. Luckily, the Moto X Force handles thermal distribution very well and there is no throttling even when the phone gets hot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the bad news is, the Moto X Force indeed gets hot when under pressure. Its metal frame and ballistic nylon rear cover get uncomfortably warm. But that's it - there is no overheating or performance throttling.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force held on to a signal and voice quality was good. The phonebook, the dialer, and your favorites share a single app with tabbed interface. Smart dialing is available, as well as noise cancelling. Finally, if your carrier supports Wi-Fi calling - you can do that as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single loudspeaker on the front proved rather quiet, but has a deep sound with good tones. You can squeeze a few more decibels with the built-in equalizer, but nothing to escape the average loudness of the Moto X Force loudspeaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's a Gallery app on board, which is the stock AOSP gallery, modified by Motorola. You're greeted with a grid view of your albums, and you can easily create a new one. Inside the album the images are displayed two-a-row, and no pinch gesture is going to change that. The gallery supports highlights - automatically created small clips of your images and videos from a certain event.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor is quite powerful. It offers the obvious cropping, rotation and mirroring, color filters and picture frames, but also more serious editing like curves adjustment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's Photos app is also on board; in case you lie it better. It supports pinch zooming for thumb resizing, picture sync with your Google+ account, shared albums, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated video player, the task is handled from within the gallery. It doesn't do a terribly good job and refuses to play DivX, WMV and MOV files. MP4 and XviD videos player fine, but you'd be needing a third-party app, if you do any video watching on the Moto X Force. AC-3 audio is no go, in case you wanted to know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Play Music is the default player for your tunes on the Moto X Force. The app has been treated to the new material design, though it functionality remains unchanged - it can play your local files, as well as stream music from the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola provides you with customizable equalizers for both the loudspeaker and the headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Chrome is the default web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Chrome has been integrated into Android to the point where it feels like a native part of the OS. By default, each tab goes into the app switcher as if it was an actual app, but you can disable that and opt for the built-in tab manager. The browser has several options that can make sites feel more like native apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome also encroached on Opera's turf by enabling website data compression. It helps sites load faster on spotty connections, but also uses less of your data cap too. For privacy reasons, SSL sites and Private tabs do not go through Google's servers and are handled normally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like with apps, sites can use the functionality of your phone (say, location or microphone), but only if you give them permission first. This way you have access to location-aware services and voice input, even if you don't install an app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is loud, mostly clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X Force delivered perfectly clean output in the first part of our audio test. The smartphone also had impressively high volume levels to round up one of the best performances in this testing scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stereo crosstalk rose quite a bit when we hooked up our standard headphones, but at least none of the other readings were affected. The volume remained just as high as in the first test so it?s another solid showing by the Moto X Force.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now here go the results so you can do your comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Flagship-grade 21MP sharpshooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force comes with the same camera setup as the top-end Moto X Play and Moto X Style. A 21MP Sony IMX230 sensor sits behind an f/2.0 lens, and there's phase detection autofocus. There's a dual-tone flash, which should supposedly adjust the color of the flash light to produce more natural results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch the camera with a natural twisting movement from your wrist. It works while the device is locked, but can also fire up the camera from the homescreen or when you're inside other apps - basically a universal camera shortcut. A second double twist now switches between rear and front camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app is a decidedly minimalist affair with nothing but a video capture button and a rear/front camera toggle. There's no shutter button, you tap anywhere on the screen to take a shot. Dragging upwards zooms in (digitally, of course), dragging down zooms out, simple as that. Long pressing on the other hand activates the burst mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is, after all, a settings menu, evoked with a swipe in from the left. This pulls a wheel with commonly used settings like HDR and flash mode, stills and video resolution, panorama, the lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of these settings lets you have control on focusing point and exposure and once you get used to it, you figure out how ingenious it is. You get a circle, which indicates where you want to focus and you can touch and drag it around the frame. You don't tap though, tapping is reserved for actually taking the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the focus selector you get an exposure compensation ring where you can adjust exposure continuously, though neither the range, nor current setting is displayed in number of stops. It vibes well with the overall simplistic design of the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we find the Motorola app somewhat unpleasant to use, which is a rare thing these days. It lacks most manual options, and the tap anywhere to shoot can be aggravating at times. Even when the focus ring is enabled, you have to drag it around to lock focus and exposure and can't just tap, which can be frustrating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that disappointment with the camera ends with the interface as the picture quality is superb. Detail levels are high on pixel level, and everything is nice and sharp. There is some corner softness, but nothing serious to worry about. You can see noise in areas of uniform color, but it's handled with care and produces a nice grain, instead of ugly-looking artefacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola's processing algorithm is almost on point in this generation of devices. Motorola seems to have found a good balance between noise reduction, sharpening and keeping the natural details. Colors are great too, not over the top, but not dull either. Daylight images come out looking exceptionally clear and naturally sharp. You can trust the auto exposure too, it gets it right every time and doesn't produce different images in consecutive shots, one thing we're seeing all too often on other phones. Dynamic range is above average, highlights are well preserved, but on the shadow end, images come out just that one bit darker than perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just don't expect on par night shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hybrid phase detection autofocus works remarkably well in daylight but gets noticeably slow in low light and can occasionally miss focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode pulls some more detail from out of there. It works conservatively, and resulting images can pass for a regular shot if you don't have the actual one for immediate comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Moto X Force doesn't do a good job shooting panoramas. The images are very low in resolution - less than 1,000px tall, and there's very little detail. The fact that exposure is even across the frame doesn't make the panoramas any more usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera is a 5MP unit, shooting images up to 5MP in 4:3 or 3.7MP in 16.9. Just like the Moto X Style, the Moto X Force comes with a front flash. There are no fancy beautification features, not that they will be missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera offers rather uninspiring image quality, but its FoV is wide, so you could easily fit at least three people inside the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, we shot our test posters with the Motorola Moto X Force. It does great in all three setups. Our tool allows you to compare it against any other smartphone that we've shot with.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>4K capture at your disposal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto X Force can capture 2160p videos. Naturally, 1080p video recording at 30fps is also available, but capturing at 60fps is not possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is exactly the same as the still camera one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos captured by the new Moto X Force are excellent. All samples came out with great amount of detail, smooth frame rate, good colors, and high dynamic range. The image quality is nearly as impressive as the still pictures, equally sharp and we couldn't wish for more - no matter the resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download the untouched 2160p video (8s, 50MB) and the 1080p video (9s, 20MB) samples if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also 720p video recording at 120fps, which outs 30fps videos after processing. Unfortunately, its resolution seems upscaled from 360p, but the effect is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can check out our video comparison tool to see how the 2160p and 1080p videos differ in resolution, color rendition and more. You can also compare the Motorola to any of the numerous phones and tablets we've tested. The Moto X Force does great in good light conditions, but disappoints in the low-light scenes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Motorola Moto X key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Excellent build quality and handling - the design may be a bit chubby, but the metal frame and ballistic nylon offer great grip and durability while the shatter-proof glass and water-repellent coating will seal the deal for many. The industrial looks work very well for the Moto X Force.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AMOLED display is very good, with great contrast, but average brightness and sunlight legibility. It can't do pitch blacks as other AMOLEDs, which is odd. The color reproduction is very good overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is very good at 78 hours, and the Moto X Force did well across all tests but didn't impress us with its standby endurance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clean Android Marshmallow with on-time updates is a powerful combo and a big selling point. Motorola offsets a few proprietary features and gestures such as the Moto Display to enhance the default Android experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second revision of the Snapdragon 810 chipset still offers stellar CPU and GPU performance even though it was already succeeded by the 820 today. The older chipset can warm the phone a little bit more than we'd prefer, but it's nothing major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clear and loud audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best daylight photos on the market - the high-resolution pictures offer an amazingly high amount of resolved details, accurate colors, great contrast and high dynamic range. The AF is fast, too. The low-light samples are disappointing, though, as are panoramic images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP selfies are OK, but nothing impressive with average detail. The front LED flash is appreciated, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the 4K and 1080p videos are great, with similar notable qualities as the still images - great detail and contrast, high bitrate and steady frame rate. The low-light clips are disappointing. There is no 60fps video recording while the 720p slow-mo videos look like they have been upscaled from 360p.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force isn't exactly a brand new model - it was announced back in October as the Droid Turbo 2 for Verizon and was later released as the X Force for the global markets. But availability back then was limited to certain markets. The fact that Moto is owned by Lenovo now is proving beneficial to the brand as Lenovo's supply chain can bring Moto phones to a wider range of markets. The wider availability is one of the reasons why we turned our attention to Moto's current flagship now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today, half a year later, the Moto X Force is what you'd call a pricey flagship on its way to retirement. It's still a flagship device by all measures - with a great display and camera, even if with a controversial, yet sufficiently powerful chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is great, as is the battery life. The camera samples are one of the best we've seen, though image quality in the low-light scenes was disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There hardly was anything to ruin our overall positive experience with the phone except perhaps the overeager pricing level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force was built to last longer than most modern flagships, so it may be one to keep. The question stands, though, is it targeting users who are likely to keep their smartphone for four years? Is any big maker interested in this kind of users anyway?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're not implying that the 4-year guarantee is a gimmick - especially considering Motorola had to sacrifice stuff like a fingerprint scanner to achieve the level of protection advertised. That said, the Moto X Force isn't officially certified for being shockproof or water-tight - yet users are promised that the screen is covered for at least four years and will be replaced or repaired for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 810 phones are aging and getting cheaper, so when coming up with potential alternatives to the Moto X Force, we'd like to start with a bunch of those. The LG G Flex2 is available at half the price of a Moto X Force and stands out no less with its curved chassis and self-healing rear coating. The OnePlus 2 with its sandstone back is a viable and more affordable alternative as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z5 is water-proof and has a great screen and camera. The S808-powered LG G4 and its leather case is a real bargain, plus it matches the screen resolution and offers a very capable camera itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 is water-proof, with one of the best AMOLEDs on the market and probably the fastest and yet most power-efficient hardware to date. The camera is great, the battery life too, while the TouchWiz has become a lot better with plenty of bloatware cleaned up. The S7 edge with its bigger and curved screen is almost like a piece of jewelry next to the rugged Moto X Force but looks way too fragile. And it costs a lot more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Nexus 6P is what you get for the complete Nexus experience. It has a similar screen, the same chipset, though the main camera is hardly a match for the X Force. The Nexus 6P costs as much as the Moto X Force, but won't give you the same level of protection or still image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Meizu Pro 5 is still one of the best alternatives from China. It has a very good 5.7" AMOLED screen, equally powerful hardware, a similar camera, and an all-metal body. Thanks to its power-efficient chipset it also scores excellent marks in the battery tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, there're plenty of worthy contenders to take the attention away from the Motorola Moto X Force. Some of them brand new flagships too while the X Force has been around in some markets for a good six months already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, clearly, the Moto X Force isn't going to try and impress users who go for the next big thing every season. It was built to last and then went on to tick most of the big hardware checkboxes: screen resolution, chipset, camera, and battery. The result is a solid performer that gives its owner a peace of mind and doesn't stop when the going gets tough. Brand new, exquisite flagships with everything and the kitchen sink will always be in higher demand we guess, but the right people who need smartphone performance in rough conditions have a solid option to consider in the face of the Moto X Force.</paragraph>
