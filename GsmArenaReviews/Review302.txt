			<paragraph>It's been a while since our last cameraphone shootout and you know how much we love them. With all those 5 megapixel cameraphones around, our hands were just itching to make a grand 5 megapixel face-off with as many of the current 5 megapixel cameraphones as possible. The stars in this episode of our Shootout series are the Nokia N95 8GB, Sony Ericsson K850, Samsung G600, and LG KU990 Viewty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are all final retail versions, so odds are they will put their best effort to all make a run for the gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N95 8GB is the revamped edition of the extremely popular Nokia smartphone. It features the same 5 megapixel camera and it also has the same image processing that we saw with the latest firmware version of the Nokia N95 classic - that means a little bit less sharpening and a lot more speed. The camera lens no longer has a cover, so always take good care of cleaning your lens. With the N95 you can count on good-quality VGA video recoded at 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson K850 is the descendant of a much-admired line of highly successful cameraphones. Among the winning hardware features of this baby are the top-of-the-line xenon flash, the fast user interface and the integrated accelerometer allowing image auto-rotation. Video is not among its strong sides and probably that handed N95 the win in the last 5 megapixel shootout that we held - it was a close call however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung G600 is another really popular 5 megapixel cameraphone. It's compact, it's stylish, and it's cheaper than the rest of the pack. It's also the single one of our contenders that doesn't have 3G support. The Samsung G600 however features the latest and most mature Samsung interface to-date. It also offers enough of the other essential goodies to be your money's worth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last in line is LG KU990 Viewty - a cameraphone with an oblique name that has several unique features. It sports a fully touch-based Flash user interface and features a fashionable Prada-esque looks. The 3-inch widescreen display serves as a viewfinder of a camera that allows manual focusing, flaunts sensitivity of up to ISO 800 and in the same time - a camcorder that can capture video at up to 120 fps (that's great slow motion clips for you).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So while we're working on this shootout we decided to give you the opportunity to play a bigger part in this edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a brand-free test where you vote for the best image results without knowing which cameraphone produced it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images taken with the cameraphones are marked as A, B, C, and D. There's no connection whatsoever between the letters and the contenders (the order of the letters doesn't match the order of our presentation up so far). The only thing you can be sure of is that the A pictures are all made with one and the same cameraphone - the same holds true for the rest of the letters.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Spoiler alert!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contenders finally revealed. You can find their real identities on page 2 of this article. There you can also see how other users voted. However if you want to give your judgement a test, steer clear of page 2 until you've assessed the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough small talk, let's get on to it. Browse the images, and have your say about how those letters should be ranked in terms of image quality. We will be rolling the results along with the whole nine yards of a shootout within a week or two.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We gathered a lot of opinions on the image quality of this improvised test. It turned out that in general the users' opinions are the same as ours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As our grand 5-megapixel shootout gets closer to roll out date, we decided to hand you over the real identities of the contenders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Featured as A is the Samsung G600.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Featured as B is the LG KU990 Viewty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Featured as C is the Nokia N95 8GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Featured as D is the Sony Ericsson K850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the final results from our improvised poll. Seems like most of you rated Nokia N95 8G at first place, the Samsung G600 at second place, the LG Viewty at third place and finally, the Sony Ericsson K850 at fourth place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that the user rating is based solely on the image quality of the samples provided by us. All samples have been produced by final retail units. Those results are produced by a blind test taken by 500 or some visitors of GSMArena.com.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You may notice that the total number of votes may not be the same in all columns, since many users abstained from suggesting a full ranking and instead preferred to give their vote for the first and last place only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should also know however that this ranking is not necessarily the opinion of our team. It should be pointed out that image quality is just one parameter of our cameraphone shootouts. Some of the other things that we like to take into consideration are camera speed, camera interface, video capturing capabilities, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to see all those covered when judging our contenders, stay tuned. We will be publishing our grand 5 megapixel camera shootout as soon as possible.</paragraph>
