			<paragraph>The LG booth is definitely a must-see at this year's Mobile World Congress. The crowd it gathers is hardly a surprise, considering the number of hot devices LG have announced. The main star at the booth is our namesake - the LG KM900 Arena. Running on the brand new S class interface, the handset really promises unprecedented user experience and loads of eye candy throughout the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also announced quite a large pack of handsets at the start of the Mobile World Congress. While none of them manages to outdo the LG KM900 Arena, which was officially unveiled last week, there certainly are some interesting names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As part of a demo at the LG press conference, LG CEO Scott Ahn videocalled Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer on his LG GD910 wristwatch phone. The answer of what the Microsoft CEO might want in exchange for this favor came a while later - LG promised to release no less than 50 phones running the Microsoft OS until 2012.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first step to fulfilling that promise is the announcement of LG GM730 - a slim WinMo-running handset. The fully touch-operated GM730 comes with a 3" WQVGA screen, A-GPS, Wi-Fi and a 5 megapixel camera. USB and Bluetooth connectivity are also on board and the device still manages to keep its girth within 11.9mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG GD900 Crystal is definitely the most curious handset of the bunch, offering an unprecedented see-through keypad. The manufacturer is refusing to reveal most of its specs, which suggests it's still a very early prototype. The fact that it was only displayed behind glass at the LG booth also kinda confirms that. We were quite disappointed since we were eager as you are to check what a transparent phone feels like (or at least what it's like to have a look through one). Well, we guess we will have to wait a little longer for that. The phone should be released in May so it shouldn't be too much of a wait.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another disappointment for us was the pretty limited information about the 8 megapixel LG GC900. The handset was there for everyone to see alright, but was only displayed behind a window and only a small portion of its specifications was officially confirmed. Obviously LG are now focusing the whole attention on the S class UI and the KM900 Arena while the other exciting announcements will be kept for later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slider LG KT770 runs on Symbian S60 3rd edition UI and comes with FP2 preinstalled. It offers a 5 megapixel camera, a 2.8" WQVGA screen, and 3G with HSDPA connectivity. The internal memory will be 1 or 2 GB and is expandable via the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also announced their eco-friendly phone (still unnamed) that has a solar panel at the back for charging its battery. It is yet another handset kept in a glass cage at their MWC 2009 booth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, LG announced a bunch of low and lower-mid-range phones, designed to address the emerging markets and users on a tight budget. You can check out their specifications here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So completing the list of official announcements we move on to exploring the handsets first-hand. The LG KM900 Arena was quite naturally topping our priority list so once we set foot in the booth we started looking for a sample good enough for a brief hands-on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily such units weren't too hard to find and here we are bringing you our first MWC 2009 LG hands-on. You will find our first impressions of the LG KM900 Arena and a load of live photos of the UI on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG KM900 Arena hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>First things first - the LG KM900 Arena was the handset that deserved the most attention so once we got to the booth we went straight off to exploring its secrets. And boy, were we impressed with how the device performed. Even at those pre-release stages the interface was really fluid and snappy, with eye-candy all over at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frankly, we haven't been this impressed with a touchscqreen UI since Apple had their iPhone, but this time we're talking serious firepower. The 3" WVGA capacitive touchscreen is amazingly sensitive and the hardware graphics acceleration does make a difference. There was no lagging or holdups browsing the menus and all the animations and transition effects ran smooth as silk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the photos of the LG KM900 Arena that we managed to snap at the booth. The phone is pretty attractive, the resemblance to Samsung i900 Omnia not as distinct as one can expect judging by the official photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apparently there are several ways of finding your way around the phone's menu. You can either drag your finger across the screen to rotate a small cube or select one of it sides to maximize and rotate it full size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly, both of those navigation methods bear some resemblance to the early HTC TouchFLO UI but look a whole lot prettier with the colorful icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a short video demonstration of the LG KM900 Arena S class UI. It should give you the first idea of how hot it looks and how it performs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took several shots with the LG KM900 Arena camera. The results are pretty good but we are yet to see what the retail units will be capable of. Here go the photos for you to enjoy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KM900 Arena made an excellent first impression and we simply cannot wait to get a sample for an in-depth review. You have our word that once we get back home we'll be doing our best to bring a review of what seems to be one of the hottest mobiles of the MWC 2009.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GM730<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GM730 is the other handset that LG are trying to get due attention on. The S class UI on top of the Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional OS is one of its key features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's really nice of LG to have made the effort to mask as much of the Windows interface as possible. There are five homescreens, each responsible for controlling a different part of the UI - contacts, image gallery, etc. The native start menu is still present but LG promise to have that covered too before the release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We just hope the UI speed will meanwhile be also fixed as the S class UI didn't perform nearly as fast as on the KM900 Arena. Having in mind however that the GM730 is said to have a dedicated graphics accelerator we don't see a reason why that shouln't change.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GM730 looks pretty nice in reality and handles very well. The 3" touchscreen device fits pretty well in most hands and the nicely thumbable interface provide for pretty decent single-handed use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG KT770<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our next tour stop was the LG KT770. The device is the first to sport a widescreen display and run on the Symbian 3rd edition. The handset packs a rather extensive specs sheet and slick looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A rather extraordinary feature of the LG KT770 is the joystick. And it's not just because it is the only device in quite a while to sport a joystick, but also its sensitivity. We have never seen a more responsive piece, the slightest touch enough to carry the command through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG have also done a pretty good job of customizing the UI of the KT770. There is now a contacts bar added under the row of shortcuts on the homescreen to allow quick dialing of a limited number of your contacts. The menu icons have also been redesigned and are now much more visually appealing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside of LG KT770 that we noticed at this stage is that its shiny surface gets easily covered in smudges, making the front panel of the phone a greasy mess in no time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG KC910i Renoir<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The start of the World Mobile Congress brought a new version of this old acquaintance of ours. The LG KC910i Renoir is not too functionally different from the original Renoir, which we reviewed not too long ago. The only major difference is that the KC910i comes with Push Email through Wi-Fi support, which the original Renoir lacked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KC910i Renoir comes in black and with a redesigned back panel. We have to admit that it looks a whole lot better than the original Renoir. The interface of the camera has also been redone to improve usability. That is quite a relief since we weren't really the greatest fans of the old Renoir camera interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the changes basically end here and the functionality of the handset remains unchanged. The KC910i Renoir is said to feature an automatic lens cover, unlike the original version which had a manually operated mechanism. Unfortunately this automatic cover wasn't working properly on any of the units we tried.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GC900<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Secure behind glass for the whole event, the LG GC900 refused to reveal too much about itself. The few things that we know are that it runs on the S class UI, sports an 8 MP camera and a 3" WVGA display. A nice start by all means, now let's just hope that it will go on in the same manner.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG GD900<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD900 is yet another promising phone that we could only look at through glass and never touch. Its transparent keypad is a real eye-catcher but that is basically all we know about it. Well, except the fact that LG will release a Bluetooth handsfree that goes well with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should probably expect an official announcement in the coming months to shed more light on the LG GD900 specs. Until then - here are a bunch of live photos of the device for you to enjoy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG solar cell phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally we got a glimpse of the LG solar cell phone. Equipped with a solar panel at the back, the handset is able to generate enough power for emergency phone calls where electricity is unavailable. There is hardly much information about the specs of the device but by the looks of it, it's an LG KF750 Secret minus the carbon fiber battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took some shots of the entry-level LG KP108E which has a body made of bio plastic, produced from corn scratch. More a proof of concept than anything else this device might just be the first step towards a responsible and eco-friendly industry.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG also took the opportunity to showcase their GD910 wrist watch phone. The device made its first public appearance on last year's MWC but now it seems almost good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD910 is the first 3G wrist watch phone that allows voice commands and video calls. It packs a 1.4" TFT touchscreen, quad-band GMS/3G/HSDPA with video-call support, Bluetooth connectivity and a nice looking Flash-based user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a workaround for texting too, though obviously on the receiving end only - LG GD910 has text-to-speech capabilities for your convenience. Alright, maybe there will be a way to send text too, but the screen estate does not exactly imply typing bliss. There is also a secondary CIF camera if 3G video calls are your thing. Despite its small size GD910 uses an appropriate Li-Ion battery allowing near 250 hours of stand-by and 2 hours full of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can expect, the innovative gadget has been shown alongside the other new LG handsets at this Mobile World Congress. Unfortunately it was behind glass, so we couldn't do much more than take a few live photos, which you see posted below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least we got confirmation that the device will hit the shelves in Q2 of this year. Unfortunately the guys over at the booth weren't willing (or able) to talk dinero.</paragraph>
