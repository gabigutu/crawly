			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung are going to great lengths to pile pressure on the LG Cookie. While the Samsung S5600 Preston aims to outdo it, the 5230 Star is set for a head-on collision course. This starlet's middle name is Tocco Lite and that's plenty to live up to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name itself is no shortcut to stardom but the Tocco pedigree certainly brings with it certain expectations of quality. So will this little Star still be going strong a year from launch? The S5230 certainly has all the ingredients, now all we need to do is see if Samsung has got the mix right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Add a dash of touchscreen and nifty unlock, a pinch of smart looks and document viewer, DNSe and smile shutter to taste. Samsung's widget-wielding TouchWiz makes reading the recipe a cinch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a dish that's already proving popular - the Star is already shifting over a million units per month and Samsung expect to total 10 million sold by the end of the year. Certainly an ambitious plan, but they just might pull it off - the Star is set to become one of Samsung's bestsellers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Star offers a basic touchscreen package with little to no access to top-of-the-line technology. It still knows a trick or two though and is keen to treat the masses to Smart Unlock. It was initially dubbed Gesture lock but in the end Samsung went for Smart instead. This feature lets users unlock the S5230 Star and even launch apps by drawing a letter on the screen. It can be any letter: U to unlock the device, B to launch the browser, J to run your favorite Java app. It's a nifty trick that adds a little speed and spice when working with the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jump to the next page for a guided tour of the Star exterior. We'll look closer at the few things that have changed since our early-bird preview.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Samsung S5230 Star<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the S5230 offers the basics - a USB cable, a charger and a headset. The headset is in one piece so there's no way to plug in your favorite headphones. There's also a CD with software and a user guide but it's probably easier to get those from the Samsung Mobile website anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S5230 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 Star hasn't changed too much since the pre-release unit we previewed but there are differences. The frame around the display is now much darker, the rear panel pattern has changed and - perhaps most noticeably - the stylus is gone. Given that Samsung went for a quick redesign, they could have swapped the proprietary connectivity port for microUSB as well, but for some reason they decided not to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 is quite a compact device - and lightweight too. It's more angular than its sibling - the S5600 - which gives it a slightly boxy appearance. You will however notice the resemblance to some other Samsung phones - the original Omnia comes to mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3" display takes centerstage on the S5230 front. It has a 240 x 400 pixel resolution, just like most previous-generation touchscreens by Samsung. Its image quality isn't as impressive as the one high-end Samsungs can offer but it isn't too bad either. The brightness levels, for one, are pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Star uses a resistive touchscreen as opposed to the capacitive displays in devices like LG Arena and Apple iPhone. This means there's a need for a bit of extra pressure to the screen for a click to be registered. On the other hand the resistive display technology has the advantage of allowing the use of stylus (and fingers with gloves).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the Samsung S5230 display is pretty decent, although, hardly comparable to the Samsung Jet, even though they use the same technology. A comparison to the LG Cookie, however, is in Star's favor, even if the difference isn't too great at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the display sunlight legibility is well below the iPhone or Nokia standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 Star is modestly styled - the brushed and grooved deck, which hosts the hardware keys on the front and the dark grey frame around the display are the only subtle accents. The strip has gotten much darker than the early version of the phone, giving it a more understated look. Simplicity is key again, but we cannot help noticing that the Star lacks the Cookie's character and charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there's just the earpiece and the Samsung logo - there's no ambient light sensor to adjust the brightness of the display. Below the screen there are three hardware keys - the receiver keys on the left and right and the Back button in the middle. The latter has been slightly redesigned since the pre-release sample and now it has an ico on it. Not much of a change, but it will help TouchWiz novices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5230 Star's right-hand side houses just two keys - the camera key and the HOLD key, which is used to lock and unlock the touchscreen. The lanyard eyelet is on the right too, though the stylus compartment of the early version is gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Samsung S5230 there is a simple volume rocker and the proprietary Samsung port that's used for connecting the charger, data cable and headset. We would have preferred a more standard connector here like microUSB, but the extra development will probably have resulted in a higher price tag so it might be better the way it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Samsung S5230 is even more modest than the front - the whole phone looks like a dressed down Omnia. The back is dot-patterned, which is more of a design choice than a boost to grip. It does attract fingerprints but they're not too visible - a noticeable improvement over the pre-market sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3 megapixel camera lens and self-portrait mirror are housed in a silver plate with a grooved texture. It draws the eye to the camera even though the camera itself probably doesn't deserve the attention - there's no autofocus, nor flash of any kind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel grants you access to the easily visible SIM card compartment. Unfortunately, the memory card slot is under the battery. A strange decision by Samsung - the other way around would have been much better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is where the Star gets an upper hand over the LG Cookie with more than twice the juice. It lasted for four days in moderate use, which is pretty decent achievement and even more so, when compared to the only two days that we achieved with the LG. If you are, however, the kind of user that just doesn't let their handset have a rest you will certainly have to charge your Star every other day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall the Samsung S5230 is a pleasingly compact touchscreen phone. It's not the slimmest around, and the old-school styling and USB port suggest it's a rehash of an older design - it's got 2008 written all over it. The white version of the Star, however, really refreshes the whole thing and makes it just as sexy as the Cookie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, we are happy with Star's ergonomics and handling and so must a million people be? every month</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It's all about the touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The latest implementation of the TouchWiz user interface is old news already with the Samsung S5230 Star. Lively, colorful and pleasantly thumbable - this TouchWiz reincarnation has inherited all the virtues of its predecessors and adds some interesting new stuff, all of which we've had the chance to experience on a number of recent Samsung touchscreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Star you get three different non-scrollable homescreens that you can alternate by sideways sweeps. The current selection is indicated by three small boxes at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can fill up each of those homescreens with as many widgets as you like. Also you get three separate wallpapers that are actually three parts of one single panoramic one, just like on the Samsung S8000 Jet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case some of you have missed it, widgets are nifty mini-apps that reside on your home screen. Some of them seem to have more purpose, such as the calendar and world clock, image gallery or the mp3/radio players, while others range from fun to pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, all the widgets are stored in a vertical tray running down the side of the screen, and you can roll them in and out as needed using the small arrow in the lower left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick which widgets to display by simply dragging them onto the display and placing them where you want. If any need to be removed, you simply drag them back to the tray. The nice accelerometer-based option to auto-align widgets by shaking the handset is at your disposal too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen and the new icon graphics aside, the rest of the Star interface hasn't been greatly modified. You have a tab at the bottom of the display which holds the three contextual keys with varying functionality according to the currently active menu. There are also some nice animations and transition effects throughout the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, much like with Samsung S8300, the interface can be quite laggy at times - it's just not as responsive as you would generally expect it to be and it tends to get on your nerves. However, the situation here - at least in comparison with the S8300 - has improved and the lags are not quite as serious and common as they were.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a 3 x 4 grid of icons, while sub-menus appear as lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 Star also supports multitasking, which means that Java applications can be minimized to continue to run in the background. However, there is no hardware key to allow you to switch between the apps. That certainly makes multitasking much less of treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also enabled the S5230 Star with the Smart unlock feature, previously known as Gesture lock. Smart unlock allows users to simultaneously unlock the phone and open a menu item, application - even dial a contact - just by drawing an alphabet letter on the unlock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook leaves no stone unturned<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung S5230 Star has it all. Up to 2000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. It can display the names from the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different information fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 4 email addresses, URLs and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture, as well as a note. You can even set a video as "caller's image" - a feature that is now becoming pretty common.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the dialer itself is not very interesting, there's a flashier way to dial. The Photo Contacts are shown as a stack of pictures and are a touch away from the homescreen where you can find a dedicated button leading to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each face in each photo can be tagged and linked to a contact in the phonebook. Tapping on a tagged photo brings up a menu with options to start a voice call or send a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the Photo Contacts really come alive is when you have a whole group of contacts on one shot - suddenly all of them are just a tap away from dialing. You can have all your old classmates on one photo and all your office mates on another, for instance. The possibilities are endless. It is perhaps not the fastest way to search your contacts but it can be quite fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a photo, faces are detected automatically but tagging is manual, even if you've already tagged that contact in a previous shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that's certainly how Photo Contacts work normally. However, our unit's Photo contacts didn't work so we can't share any further impressions of them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 Star is excellent at its main job - making calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to say about the dialer. You dial just like you would on any touch phone. There are three virtual buttons - phonebook, more and back. When you type a number or look it up in the contact list, by tapping More you access options like voice call, send message or add to phonebook. Of course you have the hardware call buttons too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the handset has no smart dialing, which could have saved the users some digging in the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When using the built-in speakerphone you have to take care to point the mic towards you (it is on the bottom so it's a little inconvenient) or the other party will have trouble hearing you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for loudspeaker performance, here is how the S5230 Star ranks alongside some of the other devices we have tested. The inbuilt speaker is among the loudest we've tested so far. You can find more details about the test itself as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is flawless<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might expect, the Samsung S5230 handles all common message types. The handset has a shared editor for SMS and MMS and a separate one for emails. A rich T9 dictionary is at the user's disposal too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the regular numpad, which is usable enough, you get a comfy QWERTY keyboard. Even if your fingers are on the large side (like ours) you should experience a surprisingly high level of comfort and getting used to the keyboard takes no longer than a couple of days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some limited Yahoo/Gmail (market dependent) integration but that boils down to a gmail.com shortcut loaded in the browser. Things are a little too small there and not so finger-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can always use the native email client instead. It failed to retrieve Gmail settings automatically so we had to enter them manually, but once that's done, emailing is a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The attachment limit for sending is 5MB, which is enough for most file types. If you receive an office document as an attachment, you will be able to view it as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Star's file browser can display the files and folders from the phone memory or the memory card, and even both at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for different types of files (images, video, sounds) to let the handset sort the memory contents. However, you are not forced to follow this structure - you can place your files wherever you want and the phone will have no problems handling them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (except the predefined folders, like Images, Sounds and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth, one by one again, or in bulk. Throughout the whole file manager you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading from the memory card is quick and won't inconvenience users at all. Listing the thumbnails of pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card is quite fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having said all that we once again must express our annoyance at the slow initial recognition speed of the memory cards (regardless of the capacity). That aside, the phone handles problem-free a 16GB microSD card full of thousands of different files. Working with the files on the memory card once it's initialized is fast enough to satisfy most users; however, speed does drop when the card starts filling up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Samsung S5230 is exactly the same as in the S5600 and hasn't been much altered from the M8800 Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also has a dedicated widget, allowing quick access to the full version of the application with only a single tap. You can also start, stop and alternate tracks straight from the home screen if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The equalizer offers the standard presets like pop, jazz, classic, etc. but it also packs three options thanks to the DNSe sound chip - widening, dynamic and surround effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but certainly not least, the player is nicely touch-optimized to include fast forward and rewind, just like on the S5600. This adds up to an excellent music application that can fully replace your portable MP3 player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 Star features an FM radio with RDS. The Star's radio app offers intuitive controls and has the Find Music recognition service implemented, which works much like Sony Ericsson's TrackID.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an option to record radio broadcasts as well, which can be a cheapo way to get individual tracks or whole song sets off the radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio app is in the Applications menu but the Radio widget on the home screen gives you more immediate access. Tapping on it brings up the radio or you could just use the widget's controls to start/stop the radio or change the station. It can only skip between saved stations though, and if you want to search you'll have to do it in the actual app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of stations, you can save stations but they are labeled just by their frequency and you can't rename them. There's a separate list for your favorite stations though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of Samsung S5230 Star is somewhat of a mixed bag. The main concern we are having about its audio reproduction capabilities is about its frequency response. It tends to deviate from the perfect for large parts of the audible range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The intermodulation distortion is also slightly above average but it is hardly too disturbing. The rest of the scores however are excellent. Both the noise level and the dynamic range of the Samsung S5230 Star can easily rival dedicated music player, and so can the stereo crosstalk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves how the Star compares to its competition. You can find more info about the testing procedure and more results here.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No Photo browser, no problem<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the latest Samsung devices like the S8300 UltraTOUCH, the S5230 Star has only one picture gallery. However, that can't be considered an issue since the present gallery is fully functional. You'll most likely not miss the Photo browser despite its eye-catching qualities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is an inherent part of the file manager and launching it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep you fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also has a slideshow function and an accelerometer-based browsing feature. It lets you browse pictures in fullscreen landscape mode by simply tilting your phone on its side (plus, of course, you get automatic rotation of the photos by changing the device orientation).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Passable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a simple interface without too many features. All the basic are covered though, and that should really be enough as the screen size doesn't really lend itself to watching whole movies on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports MPEG-4 videos but we only managed to get QVGA samples running. The VGA resolution videos we tried playing turned out to be unsupported. The video player can also use the accelerometer so once you flip the phone to its side it goes landscape and fullscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel fixed-focus shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 Star features a 3 megapixel camera with fixed focus and is capable of taking photos with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera does not have auto-focus, but it sports the nice Smile shot feature. Basically when you turn it on, pushing the camera button doesn't immediately take a picture. Instead it just starts monitoring the framed face and as soon as the person smiles (or at least grins), the handset takes the shot for you automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized and is certainly one of the most comfortable camera interfaces on a touchscreen device so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice contrast is the best part about the actual photos taken with the camera. On the other hand the noise suppression is a bit too aggressive at times, eradicating all fine detail (notice that foliage has a distinct oil-painting look). The noise levels also seem a bit high and the color reproduction is inaccurate on many occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the overall result is passable and cannot by any means ruin the whole deal. You can see that for yourselves from the samples below:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung S5230 Star. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording capabilities of the Samsung S5230 Star are very poor - it maxes out at QVGA@15fps. Hardly any usable videos can be produced with those specs but the consolation is that the competing LG Cookie doesn't offer anything better either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample Samsung S5230 video recording for you to check out.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is a letdown<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 is usable worldwide with quad-band GSM support; however, it lacks 3G support so you'll have to stick to EDGE as there's no Wi-Fi on board either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least Bluetooth is present and it is complemented by A2DP support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the majority of the new Samsung devices which sport a microUSB port, the Star comes with the company proprietary port. You can set up the phone to connect in mass storage mode or PC suite mode (or Media player) or to prompt each time it's paired with a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In mass storage mode it gives access to the memory card but not to the internal memory and you cannot use the phone for calls or data in this mode. Annoyingly, it would often be impossible to access the memory card on the S5230 for a couple of minutes after connecting in mass storage mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Remarkable web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 Star, like the Samsung S8000 Jet, features the new WebKit-based Dolfin web browser, which is an application developed in-house. With full Flash support and the new one-finger zooming algorithm it is one of the finest web browsers we have seen so far, especially on a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new web browser allows up to 5 pages to be open at the same time. Multiple downloads in the background are also supported and there is also a built-in AdBlocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one-finger zooming works like a charm too. Of course you can also rely on double tapping a block of text or an image and the handset will automatically zoom in to it. Another double tap and you are back to the previous zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to Flash and Java support, the new web browser also offers kinetic scrolling and fullscreen view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll by simply sweeping a finger across the screen. The actual scrolling is very sluggish and is perhaps the only downside to browsing if you don't include the lack of tabbed browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>YouTube videos can also be watched using the dedicated widget which redirects you to m.youtube.com.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Star doesn't come with Wi-Fi support so if you don't have an unlimited data plan, be prepared for some hefty bills.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5230 Star has a number of useful time-management applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. You can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday. However, with the Samsung S5230 there is only a single type of event available in the calendar. You can set the starting date and time of the event and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm is quite customizable. You can set up to 10 alarms, each with the following configurable options - custom ringtone, volume, repetition days and name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator of the Samsung S5230 is very basic. Among the other organizer offerings are a voice recorder, a world time application and a unit converter. The voice recorder limit is set to 60 minutes. A countdown timer and a stopwatch also come in useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also to-do and memo applications for jotting down tasks and notes. You can also use the memo widget to place a memo on the homescreen where you're unlikely to forget it. The widget and the application are separate so don't expect your memos to automatically pop up on screen. Oh, and there's a to-do widget as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung S5230 comes with an office document viewer that supports Word, Excel, Powerpoint and PDF files. It's an application developed by Access and is one of the nicest additions to the software package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The documents viewer is quick enough when opening files; however, panning is rather slow. The document viewer also works in landscape mode (rotating the screen automatically), which makes reading a little easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, even though the Samsung S5230 doesn't have a GPS receiver built-in, it comes with the preloaded Google Maps app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two and a half games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical of Samsung recently, the S5230 offers a bunch of trial games. But this time, surprisingly, Samsung decided to add a couple of playable games, namely the Bubble Popper Deluxe and the WideStar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bubble Popper is more like a game and a half since it includes a demo version of the Party Island game. Leaving the demo aside, in Bubble Popper, as the name suggests, you have to pop all bubbles before they reach you. The title doesn't make it sound like itvery tempting but if you have time to kill, it's an enjoyable way to do it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for WideStar, you have to align 3 or more symbols of a kind to make them disappear. The more of them that disappear, the more points you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also aboard is the well-known Tumbling dice app, which uses the built-in accelerometer. Shaking the phone for an occasional roll of the dice is a fun way to try your luck, and while it's free, it's not practical or particularly entertaining.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A couple of days ago Samsung announced they're selling a million Stars a month and expect sales to reach a total of 10 million units by the end of the year. To some it might sound too ambitious, but considering the nice touchscreen package and the low street price (below 200 euro), those projections are beginning to look more and more achievable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You're free to feel whatever you like about statistics but users have the last word and that's that. In fact, there really isn't much to complain about at that price point. The design is passable, the screen just fine and the feature pack is good enough. And when it comes to competition, there aren't many devices like this out there (though expect that to change in the near future).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only direct competitor is the well known LG KP500 Cookie. The compatriot rival sports similar features, looks cooler and costs way lower. However, it's only a matter of time for the price of the Star to drop to that level and for the choice to become hard again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KP500 Cookie</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a month or two there will be one more handset to try and snatch part of the Star's market share. Of course, we are talking about one of the latest XpressMusic devices - the Nokia 5530 XpressMusic. Its price tag is heftier but the extra cash gets you Symbian OS, Wi-Fi support, a 3-megapixel autofocus shooter and solid music pedigree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5530 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To wrap it all up, the Star is cruising towards platinum sales. That it takes a Symbian smartphone to put the brakes is nothing short of a compliment. The price bracket does not imply anything overwhelmingly impressive but as long as that sales meter is ticking the starlet is very well on track.</paragraph>
