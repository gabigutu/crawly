			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 830 is probably the last smartphone to wear the iconic Nokia logo, five letters with so much history behind. And while it might not be a model as iconic as the original 808 PureView or the Lumia 1020, the Nokia Lumia 830 is destined to go down in history as the end of an era. But let's not write it off just yet, the Lumia 830 is still in the beginning of its journey.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Riding the current wave of smartphones with thin metal frames, this colorful baby comes up with a vivid screen, a PureView camera and a snappy chipset behind an even snappier Windows Phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has put some serious thought when designing the new Nokia Lumia 830 and you can tell this from the first glimpse - it's a gorgeously looking phone with solid build. The flagship-worthy design incorporates a metal frame, a 2.5D screen glass, exchangeable rear covers in various colors, an OIS-enabled rear camera highlighted with a black glass. The PureView sensor is a key selling point, of course, with 10MP resolution, ZEISS lens and optical image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there is more - the Lumia 830 is up to date with wireless charging support out of the box, LTE connectivity, NFC, it even supports 128GB microSD memory cards. Nokia Lumia 830 is among the first devices to run natively on the Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 OS with the latest Lumia Denim enhancements. And don't forget this all-round package is mid-range price!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is very little the Nokia Lumia 830 got wrong. While the Snapdragon 400 chipset delivers a so-so performance on Android smartphones, we already know the lightweight Windows Phone will chug along happily on that sort of hardware. But we'll get into that in a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not make the Lumia 830 wait any longer. It's time get it through our traditional hands-on treatment and proceed with the hardware checkup shortly after.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Lumia 830<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 830 comes in a moderate-sized retail box that contains just the basics - a charger and a microUSB cable. There is no bundled headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the phone supports wireless charging out of the box, you'll have to buy an additional charging plate if you want to use it as there isn't one included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you reside in the US, you will get two colored back covers in your retail box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lumia 830 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 830 sports a 5" display and an aluminum frame, just like the flagship Lumia 930 model. It comes with a smaller battery though and a more compact camera hardware, which allows the Lumia 830 to keep an even thinner profile and a lighter body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Lumia 830 measures 139.4 x 70.7 x 8.5 mm and weighs 150 grams - that's a millimeter thinner and 15g lighter than the Lumia 930.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 830 looks a lot like its flagship sibling - the Lumia 930. It has a metal frame, which is becoming a trend these days. It also features the so-called 2.5D screen glass, which has been around for quite a while too, but it is just recently when somehow it became a feature worth mentioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking Nokia Lumia 830 at the front you can definitely see the resemblances with its predecessors - the Lumia phones have always been recognizable precisely by the front glass that's curved around the edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cover is manufactured from matte plastic, which is grippy and resistant to fingerprint smudges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is part of a round black glass plate. The discreet PureView and ZEISS logos are around, surely boosting the phone's overall impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is easily removable and you can buy some spare panels to freshen up your Lumia 830 wherever you are bored with the original looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't like your original battery cover, you can get one in a different color but the color of the frame will always be the initial one you've picked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We spent some time with the black-framed Lumia 830 and it certainly has a classy, understated look to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The highlights of the Nokia Lumia 830 - the aluminum frame and the matte plastic rear cover - are the two major contributors to the phone's great grip and overall positive feel when handling it. The 5" footprint is neither small, nor big and the Lumia 830 is perfectly usable with just one hand, no special software modes or tweaks required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After spending a few minutes with the Nokia Lumia 830 we have already fallen in love with the design and build. Sure, the green paintjob isn't everyone's cup of tea, but that's why you can always opt for white, black or orange.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The entire Lumia 830's front is protected with a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. Above the beautiful ClearBlack display we find the 0.9MP front snapper, the earpiece and a couple of sensors. Unlike the Lumia 730/735 the front snapper is not selfi-centric.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the 5" HD screen is where the traditional Windows control deck resides. You get three capacitive keys as usual Back, Start and Search. A tap and hold on the Back brings the multitasking menu upfront, while the Search key will either summon Cortana or pop up the Bing Search app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary mic pinhole is just below the Start key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is completely bare, while the right is pretty busy - there are the aluminum volume rocker, power/lock key and the camera shutter. If you aren't keen on waking up your phone with a key, you can always turn on the double tap to wake option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Lumia 830 hosts a centrally-located 3.5mm audio jack next to the microUSB port, which is used for PC connections and wired charging. As we've already mentioned before, the retail package of the Lumia 830 doesn't come with a headset, so you'll have to get one extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing special to note on the bottom of the Lumia 830.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really like the back of the Lumia 830. The 10MP PureView camera with ZEISS optics is surrounded by a round black glass element, which looks gorgeous surrounded by the rear cover. The LED flash is also carved into the glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the loudspeaker grill is at the bottom of the back, though it is much smaller than the dotted pattern suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover of the Nokia Lumia 830 fits perfectly, but it's easily removable. Underneath lay the hot-swappable microSD card slot (up to 128GB) and the nanoSIM bed. The battery is user exchangeable as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 830 packs a 5" ClearBlack IPS display of 720p resolution. The pixel density of 294ppi provides excellent sharpness and great image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are very punchy, with deep blacks, and viewing angles are very good too. There's not much color and contrast loss even if you look at it at an extreme angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a microscopic image of the screen's RGB matrix - it does come with a standard pixel arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive touch sensor on the display features the supersensitive touch technology that allows it to detect fingers even through winter gloves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 830 comes with the Lumia Color Profile option in the settings, which gives you three sliders to play with - one for color temperature (which spans the cool, neutral and warm range), color saturation (natural to vivid) and tint (green to purple).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also customize the brightness levels for the three presets - low, medium and high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering is very good and, as an added bonus, you can tweak the white balance and saturation to your liking. The one weak spot of the display is the black levels, which are not as great as on AMOLED, but the overall contrast is still quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ClearBlack tech does help minimize reflectivity. The relatively low brightness however hurts the outdoor performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 830 is powered by a 2,200 mAh battery. According to the official stats it should be enough for about half a day's worth of 3G calls and 22 days on stand-by. Naturally, we've ran our battery test and the results are in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 830 is indeed capable of lasting half a day on a call and then some. Its browser and video playback endurances are also commendable, but the standby performance is only average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Make note, that our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but it is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 830 posted 68 hour endurance rating, meaning you can use the smartphone for over two and a half days and do an hour each of calling, web browsing, and watching videos each day, and still have some left in the tank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 830 comes with support for quad band GSM, 3G, and LTE networks. The LTE is rated as Category 4, which means you can enjoy up to 150Mbps downlink and up to 50Mbps of uplink (all that carrier-dependent, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity includes dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n (that's includes both the 2.4GHz and the 5GHz band), and DLNA. There is also stereo Bluetooth 4.0 and a GPS receiver with GLONASS support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC connectivity lets you share content with other NFC-enabled devices, or you can use NFC and the Wallet app to pay for purchases at participating retailers. You can download a NFC management app from the Windows Store if you'd like to manage NFC tags as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the ability to cast content wirelessly to a TV, monitor or projector via the dedicated menu in the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internet sharing feature also lets you share content using a specific broadcast name and password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear panel of the Nokia Lumia 830 is wireless charging-enabled, so you just need to treat yourself with a compatible charging plate to make proper use of it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>WP8.1 with Update 1 treated with Lumia Denim<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 830 is running the latest available Windows Phone 8.1 (with Update 1) out of box, plus the latest Lumia Denim software expansion package comes pre-installed, too. The Windows Phone 8.1 major firmware update has already rolled out to Windows Phone 8 devices, and represents the latest that Microsoft has to offer in a mobile OS. The Update 1 expansion adds folder support, customizable snooze alarms, enables Cortana in UK and China, plus includes some under the hood improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8.1 brings a plethora of new features and UI improvements. Lumia Denim enriched the user experience with better and faster Lumia Camera app, Moment Capture feature, Rich Capture, Better Glance Screen, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we dig into details, here comes our traditional UI walkthrough to get you warmed up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start our tour with the lockscreen. Nokia's proprietary Glance Screen is back, updated with new features. Now it supports Bing Weather and Bing Health &amp; Fitness app, but you need to be running those on your lockscreen as well. The Glance Screen is basically a monochrome representation of your lockscreen. Double tap to wake option is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you unlock your Nokia Lumia 830, you'll get to the familiar interface with resizable live tiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under Windows Phone 8.1, you can now select a background image to make some of your live tiles look more uniform. This looks great, except that not all live tiles are transparent, which can detract from the overall effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Update 1 you can now create folders at your Start page. Using them is easy and intuitive. We have been waiting for this option for a long time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the major novelties brought by Windows Phone 8.1 is a unified notification center. Microsoft calls this the Action Center and you access it by pulling down from the top of the screen, just like on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Center lets you access quick toggles as well as various app notifications. You can swipe individual notifications off the screen or you can click the dedicated clean all key to remove them all at once. Sliding down the Action Center also reveals a battery percentage indicator below the battery icon, as well as the date and carrier network below the clock and reception icons, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four toggles at the top are fully customizable. The available options include Airplane mode, Bluetooth, brightness, camera, internet sharing, location, project my screen, quiet hours, rotation lock, VPN, Wi-Fi, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different toggles have different actions, however: a double tap on the Wi-Fi button will get you to the Wi-Fi settings menu, while a double-tap on the Bluetooth - won't. It's a somewhat confusing inconsistency and detracts from the overall usability of the toggle system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like on iOS, here you can customize the notifications - you can choose whether banners, sounds and vibration are available for each notification type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft chose Apple's way of handling apps running in background - most of the apps are suspended upon hitting the Windows key and will be resumed once you bring them back. There are others, of course, such as Navigation, Cortana and Battery apps, which will continue to run in background unless you specifically kill them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quiet Hours mode is acts much the same as a Do Not Disturb mode - it can be set to block calls and messages over pre-defined time interval, plus it can also go on automatically during events you have marked in your calendar. Just like its competing services, Quiet Hours supports the so-called Inner Circle - the notifications from your Inner Circle will always break through. There is also an option to allow calls from people who call you more than two times in less than three minutes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8.1 doesn't offer a full-featured and system-wide file manager out of the box but Microsoft allows you to download their newly released Files app, which would service the purpose of accessing the storage memory and manage all files stored there regardless of which app they are meant for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone, just like iOS and Android, offers Find My Phone option. If you lose your phone, you can log into WindowsPhone.com with your Microsoft ID and try to locate your phone from there. Ring, lock and wipe options are available as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 830 is powered by the widely used Snapdragon 400 chipset. It has four Cortex-A7 processor cores clocked at 1.2GHz, Adreno 305 graphics common for most of the Windows Phone gang and 1GB RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, we ran the multi-platform compound test BaseMark OS II, which takes in consideration CPU performance, graphics, web benchmark, and memory. The Lumia 830 posted a mid-range score, slightly better than its S400-powered Lumia siblings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we ran AnTuTu for Windows Phone, which also gauges the overall system performance. Here Lumia 830 is on par with the Snapdragon 400-running Lumia 630.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we ran the JavaScript-centric Kraken benchmark and the compound BrowserMark 2.1. It turned out that the Internet Explorer browser isn't on par with today's mobile competition - it isn't even close to Chrome and Safari in these benchmarks though in real life usage, the difference is hardly as noticeable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end of the day it's the real life performance that matters and it's great. Nokia Lumia 830 runs the Windows Phone 8.1 buttery smooth, without any lags whatsoever. All default apps and the Office suite did great, as well as some popular game titles we tried out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Lumia 830 delivers adequate performance, which is exactly what we expected.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Cortana is there to ease your day<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Cortana, which premiered on Windows Phone 8.1, is Microsoft's answer to Siri, S Voice and Google Now. It does a pretty good job with voice recognition and it has the potential of helping you out on a number of occasions throughout your day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana is very similar to Siri. The voice comes courtesy of Halo's Jen Taylor and is probably the most human-like sounding virtual assistant we've encountered. It recognizes your voice commands and questions in natural human language and provides voice feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, what can Cortana actually do for you? First you need to personalize it in order to utilize its full potential. The Settings are called Notebook and are divided into Interests, Reminders, Quiet Hours, Inner Circle, Places, and Music Searches. In Interests you can assign literally everything you like and Cortana will help you track specific news, plan trips, find restaurants or bars, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana supports reminders including contact-based ones - you can tell her to remind you of something next time you call some of your contacts. It also supports reminders by location (home, work, university, stores), so it can remind you to wish a coworker a happy birthday before starting with the work-related questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana can also remember places, important people to you (it can even suggest such people based on your activity), plus it can actively control your quiet hours mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana can fully interact with your phone and carry out all kind or commands related to it - make a call, send a message, add appointments, take notes, set alarms, play specific music or playlists, navigate you to locations or simply search the web. It can also turn on/off settings or give you straightforward answers to simple questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cortana is also capable of checking the traffic in your city and it will remind you to leave early or warn you if your bus or train has been delayed. It can also provide alternatives routes to avoid traffic jams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unique among virtual assistants, Cortana can also forward your commands to third party apps, so you can for example ask it to open Skype and call some of your contacts. Only Skype, Facebook and Twitter currently support this functionality, but others should follow sooner rather than later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the speed of voice recognition is concerned, WP's virtual assistant does a fine job. Words are recognized almost in real time, and the accuracy has greatly improved since its earlier iterations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri can do a lot more than Cortana today, while Google Now with its automatically appearing cards is probably the most useful of the bunch, but those two have quite a head start. Microsoft does remind you that Cortana is still in beta, so we expect even better performance and functionality once it's finalized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'd also like to see Cortana hitting other regions and languages as the US, UK and China are the only ones supported for now. It recently became available in early alpha version in Australia, Canada and India, but this is surely not enough. The good news is you can bypass that limitation by simply changing your region in the settings menu - no complicated hacks required.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The People phonebook is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>People Hub is the phonebook that you'll find on the Nokia Lumia 830, and is one of the more capable such applications we've seen. It supports multiple accounts, including social ones, and has multiple pages like the rest of the WP interface. The first page is your contacts list, the second one is What's New with all of your friends' social updates, then come (chat) Rooms, and Groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the People app, viewing a single contact also allows you to check this specific person's social updates plus you can view the complete history of exchange with this contact in one place, displayed chronologically. Everything but status updates is listed here: calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me tile is also available, which acts as your collective social hub - you can see all of your social updates here, post statuses across all services, and even a check-in option is available. You can send IMs to your Facebook/Twitter friends from the Me app, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone application on the Nokia Lumia 830 shows you call history with call duration, courtesy of the WP 8.1 update. There are shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. Smart dial is not supported, but you can use Cortana to dial someone in a flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One new feature you'll notice in the in-call screen is the Skype button. If you hit it, your call will be automatically transferred into a free Skype video chat. Of course, the other user must have a Skype client installed plus an active internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the Lumia 830 scored a Good mark. The loudspeaker isn't the loudest around but missed calls shouldn't be a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messaging hub has two new options - a shortcut to go to the contact's full details in People Hub, plus a setting to mute the thread. If you choose Mute, then you'll stop receiving any notifications for incoming messages from this number, though the messages will still be saved in the thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. As a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages. That's one thing we love about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native email client has very simple interface but it offers everything an email client should feature - support for multiple accounts, threaded view, batch operations, search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linked Inbox is available too - you can link all of your mail boxes into a single one from the Outlook app's settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While retaining the same looks, the virtual keyboard now supports Wordflow - a Swype-like input method allowing you to quickly input words without lifting your finger by swiping through the letters. It is extremely accurate and recently managed to set a new Guinness Record for typing on a virtual keyboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photos app does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In Windows Phone 8.1 the Photo Hub has lost the magazine UI in favor of the traditional WP page view. You get three swipe-able pages - all, albums and favorites - all pretty much self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Automatic OneDrive backup is available, you just need to enable it from the settings. Microsoft gives you 15GB for free plus 3GB for the each device on which you turn on the automatic OneDrive camera upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include Bluetooth file transfer, messaging, email, Facebook, OneDrive and other available social services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox music app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default Xbox music player in Windows Phone 8.1 uses the familiar page layout - you get Now Playing page; Collection view with shortcuts to artists, albums, songs, genres, playlists, and Music Store highlights. It also allows you to create, edit and delete playlists straight from your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player is compatible with your Xbox Music account and can stream your songs if you have active connection without saving them on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Music app doesn't support FLAC playback. Equalizer options are available from Settings -&gt; Audio. You can either user presets or customize your own. Dolby Virtual Surround and Dolby Dialog Enhancer (in movies) are available, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Same video player with limited codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is a separate app called Video. It has a four-page layout - your collection, movie store, TV store and spotlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player supports XviD, DivX, MOV and MP4 videos up to 1080p resolution. The few things it won't play are MKV files and videos using the AC3 audio codec. There is a limited subtitles support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio with RDS support on board the Lumia 830. You can use the loudspeaker for the FM radio, though you still need the headset connected as it doubles as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is pretty good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 830 shares the majority of its audio hardware with the Lumia 735 or at least that's what the closely matched output makes us believe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone scores excellently when plugged into an active external amplifier mixing clean output and high volume levels - higher than all of its non-HTC rivals in fact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones does cause a spike in stereo crosstalk, while the frequency response worsens a bit but still remains very good. Volume levels drop a bit too but again remain above average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A very good overall showing by the mid-range Lumia 830 here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>10MP PureView camera with Zeiss optics and OIS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 830 comes with a 10MP PureView shooter with Carl Zeiss lens. It also features optical image stabilization for both still images and video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The optical image stabilization on the Lumia 830 allows for snapping low-light photos at lower shutter speeds than regular cameras. For example it can shoot at 1/3s speed handheld and you will still get a proper photo with good quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has created a proprietary app for all Lumia smartphones called Nokia Camera, which is now renamed to Lumia Camera due to Microsoft's completed acquisition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The (Lumia) camera interface is very familiar - it offers white balance, focus, ISO, shutter speed up to 4s and exposure settings. Expanding the top settings menu puts the camera in Pro mode, which lets you adjust such things as ISO, exposure, shutter speed, white balance, and more, via a nifty slider interface that pops up on the right side of the frame. Your adjustments show up real-time so you can easily set up the exact shot parameters that you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resulting 10MP samples on the Lumia 830 are of high quality, with accurate exposure and colors. There is plenty of detail, no visible defects or focus issues. There is visible digital noise throughout the images even in good light, but the mature processing means you get crisp looking images even when pixel peeping. Corner-to-corner sharpness is excellent. The white balance sometimes strays into the yellow and green channels, but for the most part it is spot on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can shoot in 16:9 mode as well. While the 4:3 samples came with 3520 x 2640 px (9.3MP), the wide-screen ones are shot in 3840 x 2160 or 8.3MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, we just couldn't miss the opportunity to snap a long exposure shot. As we mentioned already the Lumia 830 is capable of slower shutter speeds, up to 4s. You'll need a tripod for this kind of scene otherwise the shots are ruined by blur.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, you can get more camera functionality via Lenses. Our Lumia 830 came only with Bing Vision, Vine and Twitter modes, but you can also download numerous other free and paid lenses which enhance the camera functionality. Highlights include Lumia Cinemagraph, Panorama, and Refocus lenses, but there's a whole bunch more that can be downloaded directly from the lenses interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lumia Panorama app does a great job producing great high-res panorama samples in both portrait (30+MP) and landscape (35+MP) modes. The stitching and resolved detail are excellent, as are the overall contrast and resolved colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo quality comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've added the Nokia Lumia 830 to our dedicated photo compare tool, where you can compare its 10MP shooter to other smartphone flagships.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 830 camcorder can record video at 1080p@30fps, with a solid 19Mbps bitrate and an unwavering 30fps. By default, videos are recorded with dual-channel AAC audio at 256 Kbps, but you can also enable Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 recording, which will up the bitrate to 384 Kbps and record in six channels under the AC3 audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is pretty much the same as the still camera. It offers only white balance and manual focus settings, and also allows you to choose the audio bass filter (off, 100 Hz or 200 Hz). Opting for 200 Hz (Strong) will capture much better sound in concerts or clubs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In video recording, the Lumia 830 perform equally good to the still camers. The 1080p videos have a nice level of resolved detail, even in the unfavorable light we shot them in. Colors are still accurate, and there are no issues with white balance or contrast, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 30s sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 830 features Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), which highly improves the look of a video - it dampens hand shake and makes camera movement look smooth and professional (as opposed to shaky home footage). We recorded a short sample to show how the Lumia 830 stacks against the non-OIS Lumia 735. You can "see" footsteps in the video but the shaking from them is mostly not annoying. The panning is also amazing compared to Lumia 735.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer 11<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer 11 is the newest version of the Microsoft's mobile web browser. You bet it went through an extensive upgrade and is a marked improvement over previous versions. IE 11 is what the Windows Phone browser should have been from the get-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft took several cues from the competition and now provides private browsing, a Reader mode, unlimited tab support with new UI, saving passwords, tab and bookmark sync across devices and support for inline videos to name a few. Back and Forward gestures have been added too - just swipe from the left or right edge of the screen. Yes, just like in iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first new feature you'll notice is the unlimited tab support in IE 11. The tab manager has a new UI too, plus a dedicated shortcut right next to the address bar. InPrivate browsing is available too, you can launch a separate incognito tab from the tab manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open an article on the web you'll notice a small book icon appearing in the address bar. If you tap it you'll activate the so-called Reader mode. It does the same as its iOS namesake - it strips down the article you are reading down to the text and images. This way you can enjoy seamless reading of long articles without any unnecessary content or ads. You can configure the Reader background color and font size from the IE 11 settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>IE 11 also supports inline video playback. In case the browser is capable of playing an embedded video, you will be able to do it right from within the article. No external players or pop ups are needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like its Android and iOS counterparts, the new web browser supports tab and bookmark sync across devices. This means you can start exactly where you left off on IE on Windows PC or slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way you can pin web pages to your start screen. You'll get a Live Tile, which will show the latest updates to this website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another important upgrade in IE 11 is the option to remember passwords and sync them to other devices. You no longer need to type in the same usernames and passwords over and over again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer 11 web browser, just like the overall UI, seems to be faster, with excellent page loading times and scrolling performance. We've enjoyed the new version and we think you'll like it too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document/Excel/PowerPoint viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS. OneDrive integration is available as well. Docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through OneDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft's collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, and you can add photos and voice memos or send notes via email when you're done. OneNotes can be synced with your OneDrive as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app can view sub-calendars for each account you have and can color-code them to make them easier to tell apart. It offers day and agenda views for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weekly view makes the days expandable in case you have more events than the small square can show. This mode even searches for weather forecast and displays it with small icons on each day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, Lumia 830 comes with Alarm, Calculator, and Weather apps pre-installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's Travel, Sports, Finance, Food &amp; Drinks and News apps are available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Lumia 830 you get a few Nokia exclusive apps - Storyteller interactive diary, Creative Studio for advanced photo enhancements, and, of course, HERE Maps and HERE Drive+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Drive+ offers free, life-time voice-guided navigation anywhere in the world. All you have to do is download a voice in your language of choice and you're good to go. Of course, to make use of the key selling point of Drive - offline navigation - you have to download a map for a country of your choice, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HERE Maps takes on other duties - instead of navigation, it's more of a replacement for paper maps that you can take as you explore a city. It will help you discover new places, read a quick description, see photos, read reviews and check what renowned guides like Lonely Planet, Insight Guides and Qype have to say.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone's traditional Games app is present - it carries over many features from the similar Xbox profile - from your avatar to your scores and achievements. It is also your gaming hub - here you can find all of your pre-installed games, spotlight news and store links.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8.1 introduced a couple of new apps: Storage Sense and Battery Saver. Storage Sense tracks your internal memory and allows you to configure which content will be saved where. Battery Saver now not only shows you the battery percentage and allows you to configure when the battery saver goes on, but it can now track battery usage too. You can also allow or restrict apps to run in the background while the battery saver is turned on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Windows Phone now features a dedicated and feature-rich file manager. It's called Files, developed by Microsoft and you can get it for free from the Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the Microsoft Store now supports automatic app updates. You can choose whether those happen only when connected to a Wi-Fi network, or if cellular data is allowed as well. Check for updates button is available, but now the Store checks for available updates quite a few times a day, so you probably won't need to use this key regularly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's time to say farewell to the Nokia branding. Microsoft has already announced its first smartphone not to wear the Finnish logo - the Microsoft Lumia 535. And for the first time ever in GSMArena's history, Nokia's brand no longer occupies the top spot on the navigation column on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Nokia Lumia 830 is the last of its kind. It isn't Nokia's crown jewel, yet it's still a proper closure of an epic phone brand. Nokia Devices will continue to live as part of Microsoft, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And Nokia already has a new plan set in place to remain relevant in the tech field - by lending its brand and product design chops to third party manufactures - at least until the company's non-compete clause expires on December 31, 2015. The first of these products is the Nokia N1. We are all eager to see what's next for the company.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But back to the review at hand. Yes, the Nokia Lumia 830 is the affordable flagship Microsoft is pitching it as. It's got top-notch specs in every key aspect of the phone and comes with a competitive mid-range price. We get a solid build with metal frame plus a curved protective screen glass and a matte finish on the back. There is the 5" IPS display of excellent quality, enhanced with ClearBlack tech as well. The Snapdragon 400 chipset runs buttery smooth on that 720p resolution, too. And, of course, let's not forget the 10MP PureView camera with ZEISS optics and optical image stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 830 gets most of the things right and lives up to its statement, and that's something to be proud of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So as you can see, the Nokia Lumia 830 hardly fails at anything, it's like the epitome of a successful midrange phone. We'll have to see how the market treats it as this is an overpopulated segment to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some may prefer the Nokia Lumia 930 flagship with a 1080p AMOLED display, Snapdragon 800 chipset, and a 20MP PureView camera. The Lumia 930 costs only about ?50 more and will give you an even better performance and still camera quality. Unfortunately, you lose the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 930</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want the best PureView camera, you'll have to get the Nokia Lumia 1020 - the best cameraphone in business. The 41MP sensor isn't something we meet every day, and its downsampled 8MP PureView photos are impressive. The performance isn't as great as that by the Lumia 930 and the design comes out a bit dated, when compared to the likes of the Lumia 930, 830 and 630.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 1020</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three Android mid-range smartphones priced the same as the Nokia Lumia 830 - The Samsung Galaxy S5 mini, Sony Xperia Z1 Compact and HTC One mini 2. They all offer great HD displays, proper performance, very capable cameras and LTE connectivity. Samsung and Sony's offers will even upgrade you with water and dust resistance. Their screens aren't as big as the 5-incher on the Lumia 830, but the Android OS will be the first choice for many so that's a point in their favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S5 mini ? Sony Xperia Z1 Compact ? HTC One mini 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto G (2014) is a perfect match for the Lumia 830 specs. It offers a 5" IPS display of 720p resolution, a Snapdragon 400 chip and the latest available Android 5.0 Lollipop. The new Moto G doesn't do as great with its 8MP shooter as the Nokia Lumia 830, but it isn't its purpose either. And the Moto G costs half the price of the Lumia 830, which is a great achievement on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Moto G (2014)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Lumia 830 job is done - it lived up to the marketing promises and we're sure it's a package, which will make a lot of users around the world happy. The future lies ahead of the last Nokia smartphone to come out. It may sound all gloomy, but gloomy is just the opposite of the Nokia Lumia 830 character. And it's perhaps just the right phone to ease us through this change and leave us with a bag full of positive impressions to remember Nokia by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But as we say goodbye to Nokia Lumia and greet Microsoft Lumia, one thing is clear on the horizon. While Nokia's smartphone brand may be done with, its legacy isn't lost. Now it's up to Microsoft to prove itself worthy of taking it over and seeing that it carries on.</paragraph>
