			<paragraph>The two LTE smartphones, which we have on our hands today, couldn't be more different as far as the manufacturer goals and ambitions are concerned. The Nokia Lumia 900 for instance, carries the burden of turning the fortunes for the Finnish giant. The smartphone was launched with an aggressive price tag, and a massive marketing budget. The Nokia offering has no other choice but to succeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan II is on the other side of the urgency scale. Being one of the best established players in the Android realm, HTC needs not bet its fortunes on a smartphone, running a less than popular OS. The Titan II does not need to sell in large numbers - the Taiwanese company has the One Series up to this task. Such lack of pressure is sometimes the key to a great product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This head-to-head feature should hardly be a surprise - after all the LTE sporting Nokia Lumia 900 and the HTC Titan 2 were both announced during CES 2012. The two Windows Phone handsets also hit the AT&amp;T shelves in the same day. All in all, great news in case you are a fan of Windows Phone devices, shopping around for the latest hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of hardware, you have probably guessed by now, that the HTC Titan II and the Nokia Lumia 900 have quite a few things in common, thanks to Microsoft's strict hardware policy for the mobile platform. Displays and camera units aside, the two smartphone can almost pass for identical twins hardware-wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick look at what the two flagship wannabes have to offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 900 over HTC Titan II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If looks are main factor, then the Nokia Lumia 900 is likely the favorite here. Its polycarbonate unibody, coupled with a display, sporting infinite contrast levels and punchier colors, looks like nothing else on the U.S. smartphone market. Free navigation from Nokia Drive is a sweet proposition on the software side of things. In a nutshell, there is plenty to like about the newcomer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan II on the other hand, sports a faster CPU, and weighs less, despite it being larger overall. Its 16MP camera sensor is the biggest you can find on a smartphone in the United States. HTC's exclusive apps add a much needed dash of Sense-d eye candy to an otherwise generic Windows Phone OS look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are now going to put these two on each other's path, and try to find out which one deserves your hard earned cash better. Following next is a look at the handsets' design, build quality, and hardware features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editorial: You might notice that this feature is shorter than usual and doesn't include all of our proprietary tests. The reason is it has been prepared and written far away from our office and test lab. The Nokia Lumia 900 for AT&amp;T and HTC Titan II for AT&amp;T are US-only phones. Enjoy the good read!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality, hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like we already mentioned, the design approach in both devices couldn't have been more different. The Nokia Lumia 900 looks bold and, very importantly, like nothing else on the market. The HTC Titan II on the other hand, is almost a carbon copy of its predecessor. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, using the term innovation in this instance will be quite a stretch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Nokia Lumia is great. Save for the rather flimsy hardware buttons on the smartphone's side, and its gentle microSIM tray, there is absolutely nothing to frown about. The phone's polycarbonate unibody is also great in handling accidental drops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 900 measures are 127.8 x 68.5 x 11.5 mm, while the handset's weight tips the scale at a rather hefty 160 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan II however, is just as solidly put together, if not even better. While lacking unibody construction, the metal-clad Titan II feels just as well built as its rival. This is hardly a surprise given the manufacturer's reputation for quality - even the pickiest user will have a hard time finding something to complain about on this instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As its name suggests, the HTC Titan II packs serious measures. They are 132 x 69 x 13 mm, with the thickness largely attributed to the large camera sensor on the handset's back. Interestingly enough however, the Titan II is a good 13 grams lighter than the Lumia, with a weight of 147 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of hardware, the most obvious difference between the two smartphones is their displays. The Nokia Lumia 900 does with a 4.3" ClearBlack AMOLED screen, while the HTC Titan II packs a 4.7" S-LCD unit. Thankfully, both displays are non-PenTile - a welcome fact, given their Microsoft enforced WVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 900 has a serious advantage over the HTC Titan II in the display department. Along with a better pixel density of 217ppi (the Titan II has 199ppi), the Lumia 900's screen offers better contrast and viewing angles than the HTC offering. It is also easier on the battery. As far as sunlight legibility goes, the two units are on par - good news for the Titan II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, if you are after the most screen real estate, picking the Titan II is an easy choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan II has a miniscule edge over the Lumia 900 in the CPU department. The Taiwanese offering sports a 1.5GHz Scorpion CPU, compared to the same unit, but clocked at 1.4GHz found in the Lumia 900. Both devices sport identical GPUs and 512MB of RAM to go with their LTE radios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of LTE radios, the battery performance is easily one of the most important features for both devices. On this occasion, it is the Nokia Lumia 900 which has the upper hand. With a smaller ClearBlack AMOLED screen, and a bigger, 1830mAh battery, the smartphone achieved an endurance rating of 29 in our test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things did not go so well for the HTC Titan II. Sadly, the smartphone's endurance rating managed to dip to a rating of only 23. This means that your Titan II will last less than 24 hours if you use it for an hour each of telephony, web browsing, and video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find out all about the battery performance of the Nokia Lumia 900 and the HTC Titan II here and here respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clearly, both devices are far from great in terms of battery life. LTE network connectivity is mostly the factor to blame here. It is essentially an extra addition to an already ageing chipset, which was not exactly known for being energy efficient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nokia Lumia 900 seems to have a slight edge over the HTC Titan II in the design and hardware section. It looks (arguably) better, feels almost as solid as the HTC, and offers better battery performance, albeit marginally. The extra clock speed of HTC's CPU might actually be doing it a bad favor as far as battery life is concerned.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Software and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Windows Phone 7.5 Mango being the same across handsets from every range, it is up to the exclusive, proprietary software add-ons tip the scale in favor of the Lumia 900 or the Titan II. Both manufacturers have put a significant effort in adding their own apps, which aim to provide additional appeal to potential users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Their survival as a leading smartphone manufacturer at stake, Nokia have understandably put extra effort to make their WP7 line stand out in the crowd. With any Lumia phone you get Nokia Drive - a complete SatNav solution with downloadable maps free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other household names are Nokia Maps, App Highlights and Nokia Music, but some of them are, or will be available across the platform soon enough. App Highlights offers a selection of apps to get you started, while Nokia Music works as a general music player but with a location-aware twist. You also get access to the Nokia Music store, which is an alternative to the Zune Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Titan II has a pretty good alternative to Nokia Drive, called HTC Locations. The HTC exclusive app is also free, can download maps for use when offline, and is (arguably) better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, the Taiwanese alternative to the Nokia Lumia 900 offers you several other exclusive apps, which are taken straight from the HTC Sense UI for Android. We particularly liked the weather app, as it adds a serious touch of eye candy to an otherwise plain looking Windows Phone homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan II also comes with a sound enhancer and a few equalizer settings preloaded. We found them to provide a significantly better audio experience than what the Lumia 900 had to offer. If multimedia playback is important for you, the Titan II looks like the better alternative.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both Nokia and HTC would tell anyone who would listen that their WP devices have two of the best snappers on the market. HTC makes sure to focus your attention on the 16 megapixel resolution, while Nokia is bragging left and right about the bright F/2.2 lens on the Lumia 900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, none of those fared particularly well in real life tests. It's not that the cameras in question are inadequate - they are both perfectly fine for most of your Facebook shots and with some effort could probably produce quite good photos from you BBQ party, it's just that neither of them is the world beater its maker makes it out to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Lumia 900 you could expect to see images on par with those produced by the Lumia 800. This means visible color noise, but a decent amount of detail and good color rendering. The dynamic range is pretty great though and it's probably the strongest argument in favor of the Nokia WP flagship as most cameraphones suffer from reduced dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan II on the other hand counters with slightly higher amount of resolved detail. It's not as great as the twice the resolution rating might lead you to believe - in fact it's only there if you look really carefully. There's quite a lot of noise here too, but most of it is of the less objectionable luminance type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an impromptu camera comparison between the two in full resolution. We made our best effort to shoot the same scenes, but the shots were shot on different occasions so hence the differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we'd give a good mark to the stills produced by both contestants with the winner depending on your preferences. The Lumia 900 shots look better when downsized due to their superior colors and higher dynamic range, whereas the Titan II photos might be better suited to pixel peepers, though they didn't charm us.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Given the characteristics of the stills produced by the Lumia 900 and the Titan II, we'd expect the Nokia flagship to take an easy victory in the video shootout. With dynamic range and color reproduction being way more important than resolved detail here, the test seemingly plays to the Lumia strengths.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it was HTC Titan II to demonstrate the more mature processing with its 720p footage. It uses a more conservative contrast setting, thus preserving more highlights than the Lumia 900 here and while the colors of both smartphones are off in videos, we tend to like the Titan II representation better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The framerates are about on par and smooth enough for both WP flagships, but sadly the focus tends to hunt quite aggressively in both cases, too. Once again - those aren't the best cameraphones you can imagine, but they will do for the occasional video that will be best shown on the screen of the phone, than on a computer monitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the video samples. The HTC Titan II will go first.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like we've already told you, the HTC Titan II and Nokia Lumia 900 have practically identical CPU and chipset specifications. The Titan II has a slightly higher, 1.5GHz clock speed of its Scorpion core, and it shows in the trio of benchmarks we've prepared for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider tests the JavaScript performance. The HTC Titan II edges the Nokia Lumia 900 on this instance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Titan II continued its dominance by getting a higher score in the BrowserMark as well - likely due to the extra 100MHz of horsepower on tap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two devices managed an almost identical score in the FishIE test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fishtank<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Benchmark scores aside, keep in mind that there is absolutely no difference when using the HTC Titan II or the Nokia Lumia 900. Both handsets will offer you a silky smooth Windows Phone experience - much like any device sporting the OS, and regarding of its price tag.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You must have noticed by now that, despite quite a few similarities, the Nokia Lumia 900 and the HTC Titan II have developed some quite different characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 900 wins the design contest. It is far more likely to turn heads than the generic looking Titan II. Build quality is top notch too, and so is the ClearBlack AMOLED display. The latter is possibly the best way to enjoy the Windows Phone OS. Our only grievance here is the slightly cheap and flimsy feel of the Lumia's hardware buttons. The Nokia will also last longer on a single charge than the HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Titan II on the other hand, is lighter, while being just as solidly built. Its bigger screen is likely to find some followers, despite its lower pixel density. It is also better equipped in the software department out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera comparison is a rather curious tie between the two devices. The Lumia 900 takes better still photos. The HTC Titan II on the other hand, captures much better 720p videos, where the constant autofocus is not that big of a nuisance like in the case of the Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Nokia Lumia 900 enjoying massive coverage, and costing half as much as the HTC Titan II, it is easy to guess that it will outsell its rival by quite a margin. This doesn't mean however, that the Titan II is not a good Windows Phone handset - it easily stacks up to the Lumia, and even does better than it on more than one occasion.</paragraph>
