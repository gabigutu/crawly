		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Whether they had a point to prove to the ex or simply kept themselves busy to get over it, Sony were hard at work in the last year or so. They can look back at a prolific period, though somewhat lacking in brilliance. Keen to quickly build a lineup from scratch, the company was consciously avoiding fights that were impossible to win. Steering clear of the premium end, Sony positioned its flagship devices just below the Samsung Galaxies and the iPhones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now with solid backup in the midrange, returning to the fiercest battle in the mobile market is Sony's top priority. The Xperia Z, which leads the charge, got us properly impressed in a recent hands-on and if it walks unscathed from a complete review, we'll know the Japanese have hit the form of their life. Sony is the first of the major manufacturers to bring 5 inches of 1080p goodness to the market, which not only is a morale booster, but will get cash registers chiming too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z is stuff geeks' dreams are made of, it's designed and built to the highest standard and has raw processing power to spare. IP57-certified - on top of that - for dust and water resistance, it's tougher than most competitors. High-end smartphones aren't quite fit for the beach or white water rafting, but the Xperia Z won't be at odds with your active lifestyle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z seems to have all the best technology currently available under the hood, so no wonder it's been at or near the top of our interest chart ever since it was announced at CES. And now, just one week away from its European release, we are about to see how likely it is to stay there for a good while.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package is par for the course<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z comes in a slim retail package that contains the smartphone itself, a wall mount plug a USB cable and a pair of headphones. Unfortunately, you have to use the USB cable with the dedicated charger as it has no cable of its own. Our unit also came with a 2GB microSD card preinserted, but we expect the size of the card (and its presence altogether) to vary from region to region.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ever since initial rumors of the Sony Xperia Z and its 5" screen surfaced, many have expressed concerns that the smartphone will be impossible to handle, even before having seen it. However, once more details started to appear, it became clear that Sony has done an excellent job of minimizing the bezel and the Xperia Z is only about a millimeter wider than the 2012 flagships. They also managed to keep the weight under control as the Xperia Z tips the scales at the perfectly reasonable 146g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, it's a tad taller than the Galaxy S III or the One X, but it's certainly not unmanageable. And if over 50 million pockets and palms were big enough for the flagships of old, then the Sony Xperia Z has nothing to worry about - particularly when you take into account that the tradeoff is a gorgeous fullHD screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z is instantly recognizable as a Sony device with its sharply angular design, but it departs from the arc-inspired back of its predecessor, instead featuring a more modern looking flat back. There's no denying that the smartphone is a real looker - the glass covered front and back panels go along excellently with the rubberized edges and the glossy blue plastic bits on the sides. It's a handset that you'd be proud to be seen with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several flaps on the sides that not only helped the Sony Xperia Z achieve its IP57 certification, but also conform to its design. There are no ugly gaps and openings to spoil the smartphone's profiles - it all looks consistent and stylish. The only exception is the rather big lanyard eyelet at the bottom right corner, but even that doesn't look too out of place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choice of materials has just one negative side - with twice the amount of glass used, there's that much more area to cover in smudges and fingerprints. Indeed the Xperia Z turns into a greasy mess quite quickly, causing it to lose some of its brilliance. Fortunately, the good news is that cleaning it isn't particularly hard. Besides, you can always opt for the white version, which will certainly make fingerprints harder to spot than on our black review unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality seems excellent as well - there are no squeaks, creaks or any other disturbing sounds to be heard when handling the smartphone and it generally feels quite sturdy. We can't do a proper test of the back panel scratch resistance, but Sony claims it's the same as the one on the front so it should be quite durable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z has a pretty standard set of functional elements above its screen. The earpiece is flanked by the front-facing camera on one side, and the ambient light and proximity sensors alongside the LED status light on the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Xperia Z relies on virtual navigation buttons rather than hardware ones, the microphone is all you get at the bottom. While the mic does reside under a grill identical to that of the earpiece, the smartphone doesn't have front-mounted stereo-speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead, the sole loudspeaker is mounted near the bottom edge of the Xperia Z's right side. It's joined by the volume rocker and the smartphone's signature power/lock key, as well as the microSIM card slot. The SIM slot is hidden under one of the plastic flaps we mentioned above. Sadly, there's no dedicated camera key here - that's a privilege reserved for the Xperia ZL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top you get another plastic lid with the 3.5mm audio jack hiding underneath. While the cover prevents dust and dirt accumulation (in addition of keeping water out), it does have a somewhat negative effect on its accessibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the MHL-enabled microUSB with USB host support and the microSD card slot. The dock connector resides underneath the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the smartphone is completely bereft of functional elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, turning our eyes to the back we spot the 13 megapixel camera lens, the LED flash and the secondary microphone. The primary use of this microphone is noise cancelling, but it also enables the Sony Xperia Z to capture video with stereo sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the back cover sits a 2330 mAh battery that should keep the new Sony flagship going for up to 14 hours of talk-time or 530 hours of stand-by.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We come to the main event of the hardware show. The Sony Xperia Z 5" 1080p display is definitely its strongest selling point and with a pixel density of 441ppi you can see what all the fuss is about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have already mentioned this a few times, but let's go over it once again just in case. You can actually see the sharpness advantage over the 720p displays of the 2012 flagships with a naked eye. However, the difference is by no means as big as when smartphones departed the WVGA screens and started passing the Retina barrier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z also comes with the second version of the company's Mobile Bravia Engine, which should improve its performance for video playback and image browsing. Thanks to that and the immense resolution, the Xperia Z has easily the best smartphone display the Japanase have produced so far. It is also the least reflective so far, which helps it perform much better in bright sunlight. Here's how it did in our dedicated sunlight legibility test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>However, the screen is by no means perfect. First of all its viewing angles aren't really great. They are a step forward compared to the Xperia T, but a very minor one. In that area Sony still has a lot of work before it catches up with the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More disturbingly, the display has rather poor contrast for a flagship unit and not really inspiring colors. As testified by the measurements in our dedicated test it comes nowhere near the standard of its main competitors and it even fared worse than its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally here's a photo of the Sony Xperia Z display matrix from our digital microscope.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We put the Sony Xperia Z through our battery routine and it did very good. It scored 48 hours, which means you'll only need to charge the smartphone every 48 hours if you use it for an hour of talk-time, an hour of web browsing and an hour of video-watching per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia gets first taste of Jelly Bean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z is Sony's first smartphone to run on Android Jelly Bean out of the box. The version ticking inside is 4.1.1, while Sony promises to bring the 4.2 update shortly after the smartphone's launch. Meanwhile Google already pushed a 4.2.2 version to the Nexus family, so we hope Sony focuses on that one instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so called Project Butter, which aims to keep UI animations' framerate at a consistent 60 fps, is one of the key novelties of Jelly Bean. Combined with the powerful quad-core chipset and the latest generation graphics, the Xperia Z gives you as smooth a ride throughout the UI as you can expect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Xperia Z flagship in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has also updated its custom launcher to go with the new Android version it runs on. The Xperia Z now gives you the option to change the number of homescreen panes (by adding more or removing some of the default 5) and even select any of them as home. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done by tapping and holding on a blank area of a homescreen or using the pinch zoom out gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to add various customizations to your phone - add widget, shortcuts to apps, change the wallpaper and change the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it to the add to homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. The Timescape and Mediascape widgets are gone for good. Unfortunately the widgets in the Xperia Z do not resize or re-arrange automatically, even though Jelly Bean supports that feature natively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a new theme changes the lock and home screen wallpapers and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no overview mode as it was with previous Sony Xperia smartphones. Instead, you get the homescreen edit menu when you do the familiar pinching gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are five docked shortcuts (the app drawer shortcut and two on each of its sides). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them. You can also place whole folders there in which case you get smaller icons of the first four items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has been redesigned too. It uses a new cool default animations and has two shortcuts for quick access to the camera (swipe to left) and to the dedicated music controls (swipe right). When the music player is active, the lockscreen will show the music controls by default, but you can hide them with a swipe if you want. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard notification area is also present, and now features a few toggles switches (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Mobile Data). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. For some reason, the notification area isn't accessible from the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is organized in pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. If you tap and hold on an app a green Add to Homescreen area will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon there and you will go back to your homescreens where you can put a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The awesome task manager we met with in the Xperia T is also here. It lets you go to the recently opened apps as well as remove them with a side-swipe. The so-called "small apps" introduced with the Xperia T are here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are similar to Mini Apps from Samsung, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to fully open a dedicated app. So far, there's a default set of four: Calculator, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder - and it looks like you should be able to stock up on some more from the Play Store as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Data usage system service is onboard too. It also lets you set a limit for network data for a specific period and usage is broken down by apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has added its own Backup &amp; Reset feature for Android ICS. It works for apps you've uninstalled and then reinstalled again, restoring them with the previous saved settings. The reset option is in the same submenu.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z uses a Snapdragon APQ8064 S4 Pro chipset, which is the fastest to currently power an Android phone. It packs four Krait CPU cores clocked at 1.5GHz, 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU. That same chipset ticks inside the Oppo Find 5, Google Nexus 4, the LG Optimus G and the HTC DROID DNA / Butterfly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Krait cores are fast, no doubt about that - two of them were coming only slightly short of a quad-core Cortex-A9 CPU and four make up a real beast. And the Xperia Z doesn't disappoint. It comes up on top in Benchmark Pi (which is all about single-threaded performance) and it's also on the top in Linpack (which focuses on multithreading).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clean sweep continued with consecutive victories in the three compound benchmarks AnTuTu, Quadrant and GeekBench 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran GLBenchmark off-screen, which means we're testing at a fixed resolution, which lets us test the raw GPU power. The Xperia Z didn't disappoint, scoring as high as the Oppo Find 5 and the Nexus 4, and a tad better than the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But most games will probably want to run at native resolution, so we're including Epic Citadel, which uses Unreal Engine 3. Unreal Engine is popular with mobile game makers, so it's a pretty important test. The benchmark was run at the High Quality setting and yet the Xperia Z once again topped posting an amazing result and was pushing against the 60fps limitation of the screen for almost the entire test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were almost stating to suspect that the Xperia Z is an unbeatable benchmark champion, but the browser trials broke its streak. Of course that's more down to the Chrome browser than the actual computing prowess of the smartphone, but the SunSpider score of 1906ms was rather uninspiring (Update: 1336ms with the updated Chrome version). The Nexus 4 doesn't do too well here either - unlike its desktop counterpart, Chrome for Android just isn't very good at this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In BrowserMark 2 things started to look up again - the Xperia Z took the second place there - outrun only by the LG Optimus G, which has the same chipset but lowerscreen resolution (so, each time the phone redraws a web page, there's less than half the number of pixels to deal with). The Xperia Z also took the second place in the HTML5-test Vellamo, beaten only by the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum things up, Sony has managed to extract more performance from the four Krait cores than any manufacturer to use this chipset. The Adreno 320 GPU does equally well - it manages playable frame rates using a real-world 3D engine at FullHD resolution. It's hardly a surprise then, that the overall user experience with this one is smooth as butter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now reports for duty<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, so it offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Xperia Z gets activated with a press-and-hold of the virtual Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a review of all popular voice assistants and you can learn even more about Google Now there. Just follow this link.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z phonebook looks slightly different from what we're used to in ICS and thanks to the light background it looks livelier. The bottom bar holds shortcuts to search option, add number field, and the advanced settings menu. The contacts, phone, favorites and groups tabs have been moved to the top and can be side-swiped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled - a tap on the contact's photo brings a pop-up windows with shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia Z was trouble-free. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation, so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad on the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia Z automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Xperia Z, and the results were awful. Scoring a Below Average result even with xLOUD turned on, the Xperia Z is a definite disappointment in terms of speakerphone loudness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is business as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard threaded layouts. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox for other email services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the generic email app can do that. It can handle multiple POP or IMAP accounts and you have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia Z offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable - the screen is big enough to house decently-sized keys that are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different skin, or even a new key layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Album is your gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z comes with the new Sony gallery, called Album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are organized into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can opt to show all of your albums in one place, and there are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can use pinch gestures to make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller. The whole thing is super responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids with cool animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Map reminds us of the iOS gallery, where all geotagged pictures are shown on a world map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab displays pictures from Google Picasa and Facebook. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos much like you did in the previous Xperia Gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast and colors by sharpening the image and reducing noise. These steps normally lead to visual artifacts, but you'll have to look at them very close up to notice. You can switch BRAVIA off, but we recommend keeping it on - it really improves the viewing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a new interface. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies you have preloaded - although it identified our version of The Mask not as the famous Jim Carrey flick, but rather a horror movie from 1961 by the same name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z did a very good job with almost any file type and video codec we threw at it, including DivX and XviD, even MKV. The only exception was AC3 audio support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A video editing app called Movie Studio is bundled too. It lets you edit video, images, and audio together (both imported from files as well as recorded/taken by the device itself), using a variety of cool transitions. You can then export the resulting project into a video file that you can share using the Z's generous connectivity features (more on this below).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman plays the music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player we saw in Sony Xperia smartphones from the second half of 2012 is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it got even more sound enhancement options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's a new ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However die-hard audiophiles might prefer additional players, which sport a 10-band or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app automatically seeks and adds bookmarks to stations in range, although you'll need to have a set of headphones attached to use as an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Google Music is onboard as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z performed pretty well in the first part of our traditional audio quality test. The smartphone got very good scores all over and garnished them with average volume levels, making up for one of the good performances we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's some degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones, but things certainly aren't too bad. The stereo crosstalk rises and some distortion creeps in. Volume levels remain about the same, though, which is not a common sight among smartphones. A solid overall performance, which should please anyone but those after very high volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13 MP camera with lots of bells and whistles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z is equipped with a 13 megapixel camera that can produce still shots with a maximum resolution of 4128 x 3096 pixels. However, if you use the default Superior auto mode, you get 12 MP 3920 x 2940 shots instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the Superior auto mode and regular mode with all settings set to auto is that the first tries to guess what kind of scene you are trying to capture and adjusts all image parameters accordingly. This includes color saturation, contrast, metering mode and what not. The regular auto mode only sets the exposure automatically, but lets you fiddle with the other settings if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the Superior auto mode also tells you what it guessed so you can easily intervene if it gets it wrong. From what our experience so far shows, though, it gets things right almost every time, so unless you are a photography enthusiast or just have to have that extra megapixel of resolution, you're probably better off sticking to Superior auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, video and still shot shutter keys, and a primary/secondary camera toggle. On the left you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three customizable shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all available settings for the given shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia Z camera offers all kinds of features, including face detection, smile shutter, geo-tagging, touch capture and HDR mode. There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera shortcut on the lockscreen does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go for simply launching the camera in either still or movie mode, or you can set it to immediately snap a photo/start capturing video. This might come in handy for those occasions when you are worried that you might miss a shot, but is also useful for when you don't want to waste your battery keeping the camera interface constantly going (it's a real battery hog).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the superior auto mode the Sony Xperia Z produces photos with pleasing, albeit slightly oversaturated colors. The resolved detail is hardly spectacular and the noise levels are only average, but the dynamic range is good and contrast is excellent. The results are pretty good overall, although we wouldn't say it has a significant advantage over the best 8MP shooters from last year. Matching their performance is still a pretty good achievement, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you switch the regular auto mode, you get images that appear more natural and lack that overprocessed look. This gives you more headroom if you plan on post-processing your images, but resolved detail doesn't change significantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also gave the panorama feature of the Sony Xperia Z a try. The smartphone produced a 5 megapixel image with few stitching errors, which had pretty punchy colors. It's not the best panorama we have seen, but it's certainly among the better performers out there.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z challenges the best shooters in town and you can head over to our Photo quality comparison tool to see how it did. It did excellently on the first two charts, taking advantage of the superior resolution of its sensor to comfortably beat the 8MP sensor. Once we come to a more real-life scenario (third poster), the noise reduction takes its toll and the Xperia Z loses its advantage.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording with HDR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z is capable of capturing 1080p video footage at 30fps, which is on par with most modern day smartphones. However, as a nice extra touch the smartphone also offers HDR for video capture, making it only the second one to do so after the Oppo Find 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came as a disappointment for us is the fact that even though the Xperia Z is able to capture still shots while recording video, it only produces images with 1 megapixel of resolution. That's less than half the resolution of the individual frames in the video itself and not really good for much. Given that last year's flagships could capture full res stills during video recording, what the Xperia Z offers is inexcusably poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's a minor thing however and what's important is the Xperia Z does the major things right. Videos come up with excellent detail and a solid 30fps framerate. Their bitrate hovers about the 16MBps mark, which is a decent compromise between quality and file size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enabling HDR doesn't do as big a difference as we hoped it will, but it still adds some detail in the highlight areas, which can make the difference between a usable and a poor video on some occassions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z enters the arena of our video quality comparisons. The 1080p video recording of the smartphone isn't quite the best we have seen, but it fares pretty well. It easily matched the Optimus G and the Galaxy S III in the first two charts, but came out a distant third on the third chart.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Rich connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z has quad-band 2G and tri-band 3G connectivity. Mobile data speeds are an impressive 42 Mbps of HSDPA and 5.8Mbps HSUPA. There is also six-band LTE support with 100 Mbps download and 50 Mbps upload speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and connecting to your PC and there's also USB On-the-go support so you can attach external flash drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media Remote isn't preinstalled on the Xperia Z but you can get it through the Google Play Store for free. It will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. There are a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z also comes with NFC connectivity, although it's easy to overlook considering there are no included NFC tags in the retail package (like with other NFC-enabled Xperia models), and the Xperia SmartTags app used to manage them is also not present. In the settings though you can find and use Google Wallet and Android Beam functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, which replaces the former LiveWare manager, although the functionality remains basically the same. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you have an Xperia tablet, Xperia link is a simple app that lets you share the internet connection from your phone to your tablet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is the only web browser on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. The minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi range, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's deeper settings, you'll also have the option to turn the auto-fill of forms and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome as well as Android Jelly Bean does not support Adobe Flash, so getting it working on Xperia Z seems out of the question.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z offers a completely new social service, replacing the previously popular Timescape. It's called Socialife.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Socialife is a Sony home-made app that supports Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google Reader accounts. You have a unified Stream page where you can view every social notification that you have order chronologically or by the Smart Sorting feature. The latter puts the stories you might be interesting before others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a Post field which from where you can update your Facebook and Twitter statuses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service offers four widgets - two for your stream with different visual styles, one for quick social status update and one with quick shortcuts to your social friends. The latter also shows new notifications with small balloons in the upper right corner (the iOS style).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z comes with the OfficeSuite 6 viewer. OfficeSuite 6 allows you to view almost any type of document, although you'll have to fork over for the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Notes app that comes with the Xperia Z. It's pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note and just start typing or doodling. There's also an option for Evernote integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver setting helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold, turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off the mobile data when the screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and it also includes advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are available within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in another city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play store is full of free apps that will cater to all your organizational needs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps with offline maps, Wisepilot navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wisepilot is also part of the Sony Xperia Z package, with a navigation license for 30-days and downloadable maps for offline navigation. You need to pay extra to continue using the app once the trial has expired, though. Unfortunately it was not working on our unit due to some incompatibility with the Android version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store is where you get everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android Jelly Bean, the Xperia Z has access to the latest apps and the ample built-in memory plus the available microSD slot guarantees you won't have trouble with space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This must be the best time in a while to be a Sony fan. The year since parting ways with Ericsson has been one of filling in the blanks - fulfilling fans' wildest dreams was not too high on the agenda. This is not to say that the brand's loyal followers were let down over and over again. It's just that they had to teach themselves patience. Well, those who did have their reward at last.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z is a burst of confidence and inspiration that will rally the troops and send a warning to the opposition. Another message is delivered too, loud and clear: Ericsson is no longer a haunting shadow. Sony has moved on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It wasn't too hard for the Xperia Z to steal the spotlight at CES - the phone has killer looks to match the wealth of skill and power. True, there wasn't much to draw the attention away from Sony's flagship but in hindsight, the top-tier rivals did well to excuse themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the biggest tests for the Xperia Z are yet to come. This one is only the second FullHD five-incher we're reviewing. The Oppo Find 5 is our only proper point of reference. The Chinese droid is powered by the same S4 Pro chipset as the Xperia Z and has a 13MP camera that isn't bad at all. The non-expandable memory and lack of LTE are perhaps Oppo Find 5's only possible deal breakers. We quite liked the gutsy underdog nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Oppo Find 5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our HTC Butterfly review is coming up - but don't worry, there won't be any spoilers here. It's another S4 Pro-powered smartphone, with four Krait cores and Adreno 320. The screen size and resolution are the same too. So, basically, this argument will be down to the details. Sony clearly has the upper hand in imaging, and the water-resistant Xperia Z is better-looking too. We're yet to run the benchmarks though, and have a proper look at the HTC Butterfly's screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Butterfly</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well yes, we cannot pretend everything about Xperia Z is perfect. The screen indeed was a slight disappointment. Nothing to do with the size or the resolution - there's just not enough punch in it. Less than stellar contrast simply doesn't do it justice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elsewhere though, we're more than happy with how Sony did. The Xperia Z is the current benchmark champion, the Jelly Bean experience is excellent, with a number of custom value-adding apps like the media players and the image gallery. The Xepria Z is an impressive package and looks the part with glass-covered front and rear, and assertive upmarket design. And if you thought it doesn't get better than that, the smartphone is dust and water-resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It certainly sounds like a package that's hard to beat. Not that the flagships of the last generation became obsolete overnight, but the likes of Nexus 4, Samsung's Galaxy S III and the LG Optimus G should be warming up to the thought that their days at the top are counted. And the Xperia Z is just the messenger - the arrival of their own successors (which now have no other option but to match and beat the Sony flagship experience) will seal their fate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Nexus 4 E960 ? Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III ? LG Optimus G E973</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, with most tier-one manufacturers yet to announce their next flagship generation and Barcelona just around the corner, the season is just about starting. The Xperia Z however puts Sony in pole position, and does so emphatically. In honesty, the experience must be new to it, but it's now the competition's turn to be nervous for a change.</paragraph>
