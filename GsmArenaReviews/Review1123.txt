			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S III didn't stay in the R&amp;D lab long enough to come with Jelly Bean out of box, but once the latest Android version was announced, Samsung was quick to commit to releasing a timely update. And it seems the wait will be shorter than expected with the official update coming in just a few weeks' time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Knowing how great the Samsung flagship was on ICS, we just couldn't wait to find out how much better things got with Jelly Bean. It's not that the latest Android is such a revolutionary step forward, but it's a flagships duty to bring out the best of its platform and that just can't happen until it has the latest and greatest version powering it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Galaxy S III has been tasting Jelly Bean ever since those first leaked ROMs appeared and now that we finally have some releases good enough to be your daily drivers, we thought we might give you a quick preview and show you what to expect after the official update hits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the official update rollout expected to start in just a couple of weeks, development is all about i-dotting and t-crossing so don't expect to see any major changes between what we have here and what Samsung will eventually deliver to your Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start with a quick rundown of the novelties that the Jelly Bean update brings to the Samsung Galaxy S III to get you up to speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the update will cost you your official Flash support, but at least for now you still get the option to side-load a modified Flash apk if it's a must-have for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried it and it worked fine, but even if you don't want to install software from outside the official repositories it still seems like a fair trade - as long as all the other new features work as expected, that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let's waste no more time and find out - we'll start with the user interface right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Project Butter and some new TouchWiz goodies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The so called Project Butter, which raises the UI animations' frame rate to consistent 60 fps, is one of the key novelties of Jelly Bean. The Galaxy S III was always really snappy, but now its interface feels even more fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI animations are great - opening and scrolling the app drawer, switching between home screens, opening and closing system apps - everything is a tad smoother and has a more natural feel to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Jelly Bean powered Samsung Galaxy S III in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not that easy to spot the differences and we needed to handle two Galaxy S III units one after the other do so, but they are there. You might want to check out the official Google demo of Project Butter, to get a better idea of what we are talking about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the better UI animations there isn't much else to notice in this regard. The app drawer and the homescreens are the same; there are just a few refreshed icons here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is probably the greatest beneficiary of the Jelly Bean update. It now offers a brightness control scrubber just below the connectivity toggles. Its top is also occupied by a big digital clock with the date - a minor improvement, but one we really appreciate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there is even more to show off here: individual notifications are now expandable. Let's say you've got an email - the sender and subject will pop up in your notification area. In Jelly Bean, you can expand the entry with a pinch gesture to reveal the first few lines the email itself. You can then collapse them again with the opposite pinch move. Neat, isn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Jelly Bean Samsung introduces a brand new feature called Home screen mode, which essentially lets you switch between two types of homescreen arrangements - Basic and Easy. Its true purpose is really simple but it can be turned into a far more useful setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have ever turned on a new Galaxy S III you've already seen Basic mode. This mode is used by default in Samsung droids and gives you the familiar pack of widgets - weather, search, music player and a bunch of shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Easy mode, on the other hand, brings a few new widgets, which feature larger buttons, favorite contacts, favorite apps and a keypad on your home screen. This should allow you to use your Galaxy S III with the things on your home screen with minimal interactions with the app drawer, the notification area and other more "complicated" menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of those two modes is that you customize both as you please and your Galaxy S III will save the changes. That way you can easily create two different layouts, e.g. work and fun or travel and home and alternate between them quickly. It can easily be used to mimic what HTC offers with their Scene modes within the Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while we are on the widgets topic, we have to mention their new behavior - they now support automatic resizing and reshuffling. Let's say you are trying to add a new widget on a home screen, but the ones already in place need to be repositioned to make room. With Jelly Bean, they'll do that automatically for you. Also, if the widget you are trying to add is bigger than the available space but supports resize then it will automatically shrink to fit into the free area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last thing the Jelly Bean update brings to the UI is the new Settings menu. It's been reorganized to be easier to find what you're looking for, with the less important stuff being put into a 'More Settings' menu for each category. Three sound toggles has been added within the menu trigger by holding the power/lock key.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The raw performance under Jelly Bean is quite similar to what we saw when ICS was in charge, although there are minor differences which are still worth mentioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First - SunSpider scored higher which means the JavaScript performance has been improved a bit. On the other hand, the BrowserMark score (JavaScript, HTML5) came out a bit lower, but nothing to hurt the end-user experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The processor benchmark we ran - BenchmarkPi and Linpack - performed the same as they did on the ICS-running Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BenchmarkPi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the graphics benchmarks results came a little lower than before, but that's because Jelly Bean's Project Butter is eating more GPU power. You can't have it all, we guess, but there's still plenty of graphics power remaining for you to use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now is your new best friend<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now is perhaps the most notable new feature that the Jelly Bean update brings. In the simplest of terms, it is Android's version of Siri for iOS, but much more integrated into the operating system. Google Now is way quicker than its competitor at recognizing and answering your queries and while its functionality still leaves something to be desired, it seems like a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will display information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out its promo video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Galaxy S III gets activated with a press-and-hold of the menu button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google Search instead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser is pretty much the same (the only two new UI additions are the previous and next page buttons), but you'll notice something missing - Flash support. Adobe is no longer supporting Flash on the Android platform and has even removed the Flash app from the Play Store for people who want to install it as an extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, you can always try and side-load the Jelly Bean-compatible APK that the guys over at XDA-Developers cooked up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera and video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Often firmware updates bring about some camera improvements too. However, since the Galaxy S III camera was an excellent performer, we didn't expect Samsung to try and repair something that was working just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we were right - there are no camera UI changes, nor are there improvements in the quality of the images or videos taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few sample shots to see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the 1080p resolution chart videos to check the comparable video quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1080p@30fps Jelly Bean ? 1080p@30fps ICS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can compare these two screenshots from the above video samples.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps and services<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Offline voice typing premieres with the Jelly Bean update. You can download additional languages (about 20MB per language pack) and use voice recognition without an internet connection. This way you are not only saving on your data connection, but the input is also operating faster as it's not dependent on the network speeds. We were also pleased to find out that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another updated feature is the pop-up video playback. It's the awesome trick introduced on the Galaxy S III that brings the video you are currently playing to a small floating window that lies on top of whatever else you currently had open. The new firmware allows you to resize this pop-up window for even further customization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Jelly Bean update replaces the S Memo app with a newer one called S Note lite - which you've probably seen in the Note II demos. It exactly the same thing that S Memo did before, but adds a few new features, such as the ability to record sounds and attach them to the note directly. You can also add most of the common multimedia formats quite easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no question the Jelly Bean update represents a major step forward for the Galaxy S III. It brings a bunch of improvements, optimizations and cool new features, which while not exactly crucial to the user experience are quite nice to have. Samsung deserves some credit for not only bringing the update in a timely manner, but also making the transition pretty smooth. There are no bugs or some newly introduced UI glitches to worry about - you just get to enjoy the novelties without distractions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More importantly it will allow the Samsung Galaxy S III to extend its advantage over its quad-core rivals, which are yet to receive the latest version of Android. The jump from ICS to Jelly Bean isn't that big to alone make you chose one smartphone powerhouse over the other, but the Samsung flagship was doing quite well even before it had that extra edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put it simply - we really love the Jelly Bean-powered Samsung Galaxy S III and once the official update arrives, we can't look beyond it for the best smartphone out there. Until the others catch up, that is.</paragraph>
