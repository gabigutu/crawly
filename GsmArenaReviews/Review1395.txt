			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When touchscreen became affordable its popularity skyrocketed ? affordable smartphones are all the rage now. The Nokia C5-03 is the result of both these trends and while it borrows a lot from the C6-01 in terms of design, its pricing is a good deal lower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Designed for a lower price bracket than its Symbian^3 lookalike, the Nokia C5-03 has some of its specs taken down a notch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 is a grandson of the best-selling Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and though it might be the last hurrah for Symbian^1 (or Symbian S60 as old-timers call it) it tries to deliver the same level of satisfaction on the bang for buck meter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C5-03 is a very eco-friendly gadget ? 80% of the phone body is recyclable, while half of the packaging comes from recycled material (and all of it is recyclable in turn).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a low-price phone with some high-speed connectivity with 10.2Mbps HSDPA and 2Mbps HSUPA. The C5-03 also packs the fastest CPU available on a Nokia S60 device ? at 600MHz the old but efficient Symbian just flies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The free voice-guided navigation is the single biggest advantage of Symbian-powered Nokias, one that is still unmatched by any other brand or platform. The Nokia C5-03 is a trusty SatNav unit, which will work anywhere in the world and free of charge ? you can download all the maps you need (won?t cost you a thing) and Ovi Maps don?t need a data connection to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Navigate to the next page for a tour of the Nokia C5-03 hardware ? but first, we make a stop at the retail box and the 360-degree showroom.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Nokia C5-03<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 comes with a standard set of in-box items ? no surprise given the phone?s low price. The list of accessories includes a compact charger (which ends on a 2mm plug), a short microUSB cable and a typical Nokia one-piece headset. Manuals and user guides are supplied as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We we?re glad to see that Nokia didn?t skimp out on the memory card ? you get a 2GB card, which is enough for photos and a few music albums. You can use cards up to 16GB if you really need the space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C5-03 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 105.8 x 51 x 13.8 mm, the Nokia C5-03 has almost the same footprint as the C6-01 but it?s considerably lighter. The weight of 93g actually makes it one of the lightest touch smartphones around. The phone is very compact, with little in the way of a bezel around most of the 3.2? touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wide selection of color combos is also a welcome break from predominantly white-grey-black-colored smartphones. The glossy piece of plastic at the back is a chronic fingerprint magnet though (especially the black one).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 values compactness over screen size and wastes as little space on bezel as possible. It?s painted in two colors ? primary color for the back and around the screen and an accent color for the bottom part of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two primary colors (graphite black and white) and five accent colors (graphite black, lime green, petrol blue, aluminum grey and lilac). That makes for a total of 10 color combos ? the C5-03 is one of the most colorful phones around (note that color availability varies by region). Throughout our studio shots, you will see two of the variations - black with a green accent and black with a gray accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen on the Nokia C5-03 is nothing fancy ? a 3.2? resistive TFT LCD unit. Even by LCD standards it leaves a lot to be desired ? it?s not too bright, viewing angles are inadequate and it gets pretty bad in direct sunlight (the topmost layer is highly reflective).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just below the display, there?s a plastic strip holding the three hardware controls ? the usual red and green receiver keys with the menu key between them. The keys are big enough but they are a little uncomfortable to use being placed pretty low on the phone?s front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s pretty barren above the display ? there?s just the earpiece. There?s no proximity sensor, so the Nokia C5-03 always locks the screen during a call and you need to manually unlock it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two controls on the right side of the phone ? the volume rocker and the lock key. The volume rocker sits pretty flush against the side of the phone and the press feedback isn't very good. The same holds true for the lock key but at least accidental presses are rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is of the Nokia C5-03 is left bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom feature the wired ports of the phone. On top, there?s the 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port (both left exposed) and at the bottom, there?s the 2mm charger plug. The microUSB port can be used for charging too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece is placed at the bottom, right next to the charger plug.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back we find the usual suspects ? the camera and the loudspeaker. The camera lens is left unprotected. It?s slightly recessed but that?s the only thing keeping it safe from scratches and there?s no flash to help out in low-lit scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is on the opposite end of the back and the well-designed curve at the very bottom does an excellent job: the speaker never gets muffled if you place the phone flat on a table and you can enjoy rich vibrant sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the back cover (two slits at the bottom to lift the lid up) reveals the 1000mAh BL-4U battery, which is quoted at 576 hours of standby and 4 and a half hours of talks in a 3G network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM compartment is under the battery, while the microSD card slot is on the right side. It?s hot-swappable as usual, you?ll just need to remove the battery cover every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy plastic at the back seems pretty scratch-prone and it will quickly lose its luster if you don?t take good care of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 is clearly targeted at a younger audience and the great choice of lively paint jobs makes sense. The color accents are subtle enough though to appeal to more conservative tastes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is very compact, light and easy to handle, plus it will fit into pockets trouble-free. The screen is not the best you can get but a typical choice for the price range.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s S60 5th ticking inside the Nokia C5-03 and Symbian on touchscreen is no news for many of you. It?s been a long list of phones since the 5800 XpressMusic and quite a number of software updates. Luckily, the Nokia C5-03 takes advantage of the latest improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is our C5-03 user interface video for a warm-up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kinetic scrolling is one of the things that took some time to get right on Nokia touch phones. In the C5-03 however, it is available almost throughout the user interface ? from file and web browsers through gallery to contacts and even the main menu. Finger scrolling has been improved as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the user experience with S60 5th is a mixed bag and what you think of it will entirely depend on your background. If you know your way around S60, you'll be quite at home with the C5-03 interface. But if you come from an alternative touchscreen platform you'll find yourself climbing a fairly steep learning curve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the Nokia C5-03 doesn?t have as sever a case of the one-tap-here-two-taps-there disorder that plagued earlier full touch Nokia devices. Up until now opening an item in lots of the listed submenus required not one, but two presses - one to select, and another one to confirm the action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that?s almost as good as gone: currently, double tap residuum is only found in the file manager. The improved kinetic scrolling will also make you feel way more comfortable than those first 5800 XpressMusic users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreen: we?ve been there</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure leaves no doubt you're on Symbian turf. Icons are set in a 3 x 4 grid or a list that you can freely reorder. Screen orientation can be set to change automatically thanks to the accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status icons on the Nokia C5-03 are located on top of the homescreen, along with the calendar and the clock. A single press on the clock starts the clock application (which is only a click away from setting up an alarm) while tapping on the date opens a drop-down menu where you can either launch the calendar application or change the currently active profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Contacts bar follows right beneath the status icons. Each contact is represented by the contact photo and their first name - and it's possible to have three contacts displayed at a time but the list is scrollable to left and right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact from the Contact bar brings up a screen with contact info (different from what you get if you select the contact from the Contacts list). It has the contact photo, name and phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further down is an area that shows the communication history for that contact ? both calls and messages. And finally, at the bottom there are the top two lines from the contact?s RSS feed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the Contacts bar, it's pretty much standard Active Standby but with fewer slots. The Wi-Fi manager is there as well ? the Nokia C5-03 is WLAN enabled. Search and Email setup are available, along with email notification showing the number of unread messages, sender and subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The blank area beneath is reserved for the music player and radio mini apps - they get displayed when either is left playing in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very bottom of the homescreen is the custom Shortcuts bar. Both the Contacts and the Shortcuts bars are optional and can be hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 features a task manager, which you launched by pressing and holding the Menu key. The task manager itself is identical to what you get on Symbian S60 3.2 devices. Much like in the previous version of the UI, it appears on top of every pop-up menu. To close running applications use the hardware backspace key or press and hold the app's icon to display two virtual buttons: Open and Exit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated hardware switch on the right-hand side of the device will lock/unlock the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A Symbian-style phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 phonebook has virtually unlimited capacity and its functionality is certainly among the best out there. The Nokia C5-03 contacts list has kinetic scrolling enabled and it?s among the better examples to find on a Nokia touch phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and you can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When searching for a contact you make use of a clever dynamic keypad, which shows you only the letters that correspond to actual contacts. Once you type in a first letter, their number decreases, leaving only the ones that actually make up real contacts names. A really convenient tool indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also assign personal ringtones and videos. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors ? accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is fine, lacks smart dialing though<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Voice quality is good on both ends of calls, the earpiece sound is crisp and there were no reception problems whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only real downside is the still missing smart dialing functionality. Some may argue it's not as essential on a touchscreen but most of the competition has it duly covered. Not to mention WinMo devices have a very elaborate smart dial system that even searches in your Calls log for numbers that are not in your contacts list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is an option with the Nokia C5-03 as with almost any other phone. The voice dialing mode is activated once you press and hold the Call key. It is fully speaker-independent and doesn't require pre-recording the names of your contacts. Bear in mind though, that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a contact, the first or the default one gets dialed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, you can silence an incoming call (or an alarm) by simply flipping the handset over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the hardware screen-lock switch you can not only unlock the phone but also silence it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 scored a Good in our traditional loudspeaker test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. They all share a common intuitive editor which by this point should be quite familiar to everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, there to meet almost any emailing needs. The easy setup we found in the latest Nokia handsets is also available with the C5-03. If you are using any public email service (it has to be among the over 1000 supported providers), all you have to do is enter your username and password to start enjoying email on the go. The phone downloads all the needed settings to get you going straight away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia C5-03.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here might just be the right time to mention the input options on Nokia C5-03. The handset offers a standard alphanumeric on-screen keypad, which automatically turns into a full QWERTY keyboard when you tilt the handset thanks to the accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia C5-03 offers handwriting recognition, which did a rather decent job, recognizing almost all the letters we scribbled in the box. You can improve its performance by taking the handwriting training ? where you actually show the handset how you write each different letter.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is slo-o-ow<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery of Nokia C5-03 is nicely touch optimized and there are sweep gestures enabled for flipping through photos displayed fullscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort images by date, title or size and you can also copy, move and delete them. Sending them via Bluetooth, email, MMS or sharing them online is also available straight from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default view is portrait but you can go to landscape automatically thanks to the built-in accelerometer. A slide show is also available but it doesn't have as many customizable settings as on some Nseries handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also zoom in the photos to see more detail. Zoom is controlled via either the volume rocker or an on-screen touch slider. In all other cases, images are displayed full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery?s problem is speed. Loading a picture takes a couple of seconds even for small images. If you have a large number of photos it might take ages before the thumbnails are generated. Zooming and panning are not that much faster either. On the other hand, kinetic scrolling has been vastly improved. The real nuisance though is that photos in a folder require a double tap to display ? one to select, another to open.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player remains untouched<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 music player is pretty functional but its design could use a little freshening up ? it hasn't changed since we first saw it in the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic. With user friendliness such a key aspect of full touch phones, it would be nice from Nokia to add some fun to the mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is automatically sorted by artist, album, genre and or composer and searching tracks by gradual typing is available. You can also create your own playlists in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The process of adding tracks to the library is as simple as choosing the refresh option. You won't need to do that if you upload the music via the proprietary PC Suite application. With the huge number of supported formats you will hardly ever come across an audio file that the phone can?t handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is also supported and if you don't like the default sound of the device you can enhance it by applying one of the five equalizer presets. And if they?re still not enough you can set new ones up in a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. However, if you haven?t set the Music Player to appear on the standby screen, you will have no way to control it. Your only option would be to go back to the full music player app using the Task manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player: back to basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To begin with, a 3.2-inch screen is not the best thing to watch videos on. The lack of DivX and XviD codec support on the Nokia C5-03 doesn?t help either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can use the Ovi PC Suite built-in application that automatically converts all kinds of video files to the format and resolution your phone supports. The automatic converter though seems to compress the videos too much, even at the highest quality setting, and they look over-pixelated but so far it's the easiest way of getting compatible video content to your handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player itself only works in fullscreen landscape mode but, since anything else would have made the widescreen display useless, this is understandable. When in fullscreen, a tap on the screen shows the controls which are normally hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the RealPlayer, you can not only watch the videos saved in the phone's memory or in the memory card but also to stream Internet video content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia C5-03 has a neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you're on the go, the C5-03 should take care of staying tuned to your selected radio station.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output - quiet but perfectly clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We haven't seen a Nokia handset to disappoint in terms of audio quality for a while now and we are glad that the C5-03 didn't break the tradition. The handset isn't particularly loud but it more than makes up for that with spotlessly clean audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, when used with an active external amplifier the Nokia C5-03 manages to pull off a spectacular performance, getting excellent scores all over the place. There is really nothing about it that doesn't match the best on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course there is some deterioration when headphones are plugged but that's mostly detectable in lab conditions. Stereo crosstalk worsened, but still remained pretty respectable (we've seen handsets score less without headphones) and intermodulation distortion appeared, but we doubt those will be actually detectable in real life scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>So-so fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. It has neither autofocus nor LED flash. And there is no lens protection either. This means that the glass covering the lens is prone to finger smudges and perhaps occasional scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C5-03 is not a cameraphone by any means, it?s what you use when you?ve forgotten your point and shoot camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as settings go, the camera on the C5-03 offers several scene presets, one of which is user defined. There's limited control over light sensitivity (it has low, medium, high and auto settings) as well as some control over sharpness and contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the settings include self-timer (2, 10, 20 seconds), sharpness, exposure, contrast, color tone and white balance control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is below the best of the 5MP range but still, the Nokia C5-03 produces some usable photos. The contrast and color rendering are good and the amount of captured detail is decent. However, the produced images are quite noisy which, combined with the sharpening algorithm, produces jagged edges. The noise reduction algorithm also has a tendency to smear out areas of low contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The major missing feature ? autofocus ? becomes apparent when you try taking a macro shot. Anything closer than 50cm is a no-go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Nokia C5-03 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor VGA videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording is definitely the worse part of the Nokia C5-03 imaging skills. The phone can shoot VGA at 13fps. In other words, videos shot with the C5-03 camcoder are only good for MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in MPEG-4 format and can have automatic or manual white balance. The other available settings are scene (automatic, low light and night) and color tone.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 offers a quite wide range of connectivity options. Unlike the cheaper Nokia 523x family or the 5530 XpressMusic and the 5250, the C5-03 has it all: from 3G and Wi-Fi to GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSDPA (10.2Mbps) at your disposal. The GSM/EDGE network support of course comes in quad-band flavor and the 3G is tri-band - 900/1900/2100 MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is handled by Wi-Fi b/g and Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP and a microUSB port. You can hook up the C5-03 to a computer in several modes ? PC Suite, Mass storage, Image transfer and Media transfer. Luckily, this time USB charging via the USB port is possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5mm audio jack is also onboard and you?ll have no problems switching to your favorite headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 has nearly 80MB internal storage (less than 40MB of then are free), expandable via a microSD slot. A 2GB card is included in the retail box but you?re likely to need more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A capable web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S60 web browser is decently usable, especially now that is also offers kinetic scrolling. There is still quite a lot of work to do before it is able to rival the best in class. The Android and iPhone browsers are miles ahead in terms of user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 browser has very good page rendering and boasts some nice features such as different font sizes (5 options), auto filling of web forms and a password manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in RSS reader will handle your feeds, while the download manager keeps things in order. There's also a popup blocker, but no open-in-a-new-window option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A minimap is available for finding your way around elaborate pages and the Find on page feature is welcome. The visual history is a nice bonus that can help you easily find a page you've visited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now we get to Flash support. There is Flash support and it?s way better that it was back on the X6. The YouTube videos we?ve tested did well with almost no dropped frames, but the loading time was excruciating. Unfortunately the small screen and resolution won?t allow you to fit the whole YouTube screen in there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mobile version of YouTube is an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another upgrade over the X6 web browser is the better kinetic scrolling. It now works fine and manages to catch up with most of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double tapping on a block of text zooms it in on screen, but again, the zooming routine treats the whole page as an image and the browser doesn't refit the paragraph text to fill the screen properly (the so-called text-reflow). As a result, when you zoom in you still need to scroll sideways to read it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S60 5th edition organizer is pretty well stocked although its applications are already in need of refreshment - especially on a touchscreen. Some of the apps are starting to look boring and dated, having had the same interface for over 3 years now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The developers are still hesitant to put the touch input of Nokia C5-03 to some good use and maybe add some cool new features. They have only gone as far as to touch-optimize the S60 3rd edition apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes ? monthly, weekly, daily and a to-do list, which allows you to check all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are four types of events available for setting up: Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>QuickOffice is also on board and lets you view (but not edit) Word, Excel and PowerPoint files trouble-free. Unfortunately, PDF files are not supported out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes two useful dictionaries (a talking and a non-talking ones), a great unit converter and calculator, as well as a voice recorder and the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, set-off day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go. This is quite convenient for, say, setting up your wake-up alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, the number of alarms is not limited. Thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply turning your phone over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're also clients for Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Friendster and hi5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no pre-installed games on board of the Nokia C5-03.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the Ovi Store, you can choose between several sections ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization, Recommended and of course, My Stuff, which keeps track of the apps you've already installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Ovi Store client is simple. It?s a list with the name and logo of each app (or podcast, or whatever), the category it's in (Entertainment, Utilities, etc), price and a star rating out of three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting an app, displays more details: a description, info on size, user reviews, an option to write your own review or send the description page to a friend, a list of related apps and a Report issue button, which helps you report fraud, spam, abuse, etc., but not bug reports or feature requests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching the Store is quite easy if the Recommended section and the Related apps list don't get you what you're looking for. Our Nokia C5-03 came with very little preinstalled content: just a few apps and one game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, since this is Symbian we are talking about, you can also try some of the numerous software repositories online. You can download the apps straight on your phone or on your desktop computer to transfer to the handset later. There are handy tools for reading news, handling social networks, weather forecasts, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation is remarkable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C5-03 comes with a built-in GPS receiver and just like the one in 5800 XpressMusic it is a highly sensitive unit indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The relatively large high-resolution screen sounds like a serious premise for reasonable use as a dedicated navigation unit. The C5-03 comes with Ovi Maps 3.0 preinstalled. It offers extensive map coverage and some extra features such as traffic information or city guides for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer an alternative navigation software, you might want to carefully look around for a compatible version. Some sources suggest that the latest version of Garmin Mobile XT is compatible with S60 5th edition, but we can?t confirm or deny it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-enabled Ovi Maps application itself is doing pretty well in terms of features too. It has three different view modes including standard, satellite and terrain maps. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as an electronic map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, to sum it up, our overall impression with GPS navigation on the Nokia C5-03 is very positive. Maps are detailed enough, the app works fine and you don?t have to think of licenses or whatsoever.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>How many times must the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic have thought the golden watch was finally coming? By the looks of it, retirement is still a long way off. But the founding father should at least be getting used to being called ?gramps?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And what about the grandson here? OK, we have some good news and some bad. We?re only not sure which is which. You see, the Nokia C5-03 isn?t of the genetically mastered breed of Symbian^3. It?s a chip off the old block ? 100% old-fashioned, organic Series 60. Now, that can?t be good, can it? That?s well out of date already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the same piece of software didn?t stop the 5800 XpressMusic from becoming a massive bestseller with its nicely balanced featureset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is obvious that Nokia is not eyeing platinum sales with the C5-03. They?re simply updating their line of entry-level touchscreen smartphones. Making sure they have every user profile covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a complete connectivity set and free navigation, the Nokia C5-03 is great value for money already. In time you will come to want a better screen, better imaging and better touch experience. Well, that?s where the C6-01 or the C7 will be a logical next step. And of course, any user will be welcome to go all the way to the N8 ? or whatever the future flagship is called.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia C6-01 ? Nokia C7 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, to get to the point, we like the look and feel of the Nokia C5-03. The Nokia C5-03 is better designed than the 5800 XpressMusic. The multiple paintjobs make a lot of sense too. The fixed-focus camera is a letdown ? and so are the poor multimedia support and sluggish app market. Symbian S60 isn?t the best approach to touchscreen but a smartphone with this level of skill is a steal of a deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The corresponding rank in the Android army is held by phones like the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X8 and the Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3. Neither will wow you with specs but the capacitive screens and Android might just feel more natural and fluid. The ultimate trade off though is between slightly better multimedia and free navigation.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you want to consider something more exciting and advanced within budget, Symbian has yet another option. The Sony Ericsson Vivaz has been around for a while and its price has become quite competitive. And we?re talking some serious cameraphone. The 8 megapixel pictures are great (not bad panos either) and it can also shoot 720p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia C5-03 ? Sony Ericsson Vivaz</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It certainly looks like there?s nothing the Nokia C5-03 can do in its defense. It?s hard to compete against the best ? even if they?re yesterday?s best. But we do think the Nokia C5-03 has one thing the likes of Vivaz desperately lack. No, it?s not the free SatNav. It?s a family tree.</paragraph>
