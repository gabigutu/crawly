		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 has no intention of breaking the chain of command. It is just a slimmer, simpler and more affordable N8 and comes with more conservative styling. The well-balanced Cseries have received an accomplished leader. The specs are impressive but do well to keep a respectful distance from the Nseries? finest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 still gets really close to the N8 in some ways. It?s got the same blazing fast penta-band 3G, a 3.5? nHD AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, a 680MHz CPU and 256MB RAM, which are some good figures for the efficient Symbian OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Understandably, some things have been left out. Getting rid of that bulging camera module has brought down the thickness. But still imaging on the Nokia C7 is down to ?just? 8MP and fixed focus. However, 720p video recording is still on ? as is Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 3.0. The internal memory has been cut in half but 8GB is still plenty, considering there?s a microSD slot if you need to expand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, here are the pros and cons in summarized form and also a quick C7 vs. N8 head-to-head.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>N8 over C7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The major advantages of the N8 are the camera and HDMI. An 8MP fixed-focus camera isn?t that bad after all and the HD video recording is still there. There?s metal on the Nokia C7 case and regular TV-Out ? SD resolution and stereo sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus it?s slimmer ? something people will appreciate. And more importantly it?s cheaper, which was exactly the point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Nokia C7 stands on its own two feet as a touch phone and isn?t just the ginger-haired stepson of the N8. The screen is among the best we?ve seen from Nokia (same as the N8 screen in fact) and the rest of the spec sheet should be music to Nokia fans? ears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But is it worth it? Should you save up some more cash and go for the N8 instead? Hold your horses ? we?re just at the beginning of the Nokia C7 review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We installed Symbian Anna - check out our impressions over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many things to consider ? starting with the retail box and hardware on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 comes packaged with the basics but nothing more. You get a very compact charger (which uses a 2mm plug), a short-piece microUSB cable, a one-piece headset and of course, some manuals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you don?t get (as compared to the N8 package) is the adapter cable to use USB on-the-go. Another thing missing is a TV-Out cable. Sure, the C7 has just regular TV-Out and not HDMI, but still ?C7? seems high enough on the ladder to at least get something extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You?ll need a composite video cable to use the TV-Out ? you might already have one as they?re fairly common.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia C7 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next to the N8, the Nokia C7 is noticeably thinner. The 10.5mm of thickness are impressive enough already, but the curved sides slim it down even further. Plus, not having that camera module bulge out the back helps a lot too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Nokia C7 is a bit taller than the N8 but also a bit narrower, so it sits better in the hand. Both are about the same weight. As for the iPhone 4, it comes pretty close but is another 1.2mm thinner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exact measurements of the Nokia C7 are 117.3 x 56.8 x 10.5 mm (64cc) and 130 grams.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 is for the most part an N8 in a different shell ? the anodized aluminum unibody is gone but the metal battery cover spans across most of the back and the plastic around it is as good as the plastic elements on the N8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shape is an elongated oval with rounded corners and the phone is slimmed down ? it?s very pleasant to hold, though not everyone will fall in love with its aesthetics. The design doesn?t seem ?manly? enough but maybe it?s just us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Nokia C7 is mostly taken by the 3.5? AMOLED display of nHD resolution. It sports multi-touch support just like the N8 screen ? and just like it, it doesn?t feature Nokia?s Clear Black Technology that?s featured on the Nokia E7 and C6-01.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The indoor image quality, as is to be expected from an AMOLED unit, is pretty good with deep blacks and nicely saturated colors. Not as impressive as Samsung?s SuperAMOLED screens, but certainly competitive elsewhere. Sunlight legibility is impressive as well ? as good as the Nokia N8 (it?s most likely the same unit, so that?s understandable).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as pixel count goes, the Nokia C7 display has just 38% of the pixels of an iPhone 4 screen and 60% of WVGA screens (common in high-end phones). The pixel density is a bit lower than that of the Samsung Galaxy S (which has a bigger screen) ? 210 (for C7), 233 (for Galaxy S) and 326 (for iPhone 4). So the sharpness is good, but not mind-blowing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C7 screen sensitivity is as good as we?ve come to expect from capacitive units. An important usability boost is the excellent haptic feedback. It?s the same as the Nokia N8 and the thing about it is it?s extremely finely tuned leaving an impressive touch feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get short, precise vibrations when you hit the bottom of lists and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we notice the video-call camera in the upper right corner above the display. Near it are the ambient light and the proximity sensors, as well as the centrally placed earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the three hardware keys ? Menu, Answer and Ignore. The call keys are easy to hit as is the slightly raised menu key, which however is just a bit stiff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia obviously decided to put more keys on the C7 than the N8 ? we wish they found room for a hardware back key too. The software one is not very comfortable, being in a different place in different parts of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mic pinhole is located just below the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the Nokia C7 is the power key, which also handles screen lock and the ringing profiles. The two wired connectivity ports are here too ? the microUSB has a plastic flap (and can be used for charging), while the 3.5mm audio jack is left exposed. It doubles as a TV-Out port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the C7 would have been completely bare if it wasn?t for the 2mm charger plug. The right side is busier ? the volume keys flank the voice command key key, and further down we find the lock slide and the shutter key. It cannot be half-pressed, the camera on the Nokia C7 lacks auto-focus anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The voice command key is a bit useless ? you can just as easily press and hold the green receiver key to trigger voice commands. There?s no option to change its function either ? it would have made a convenient shortcut for other applications or functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is small and almost flush against the side of the phone, making it rather uncomfortable to press. This might result in some extra camera shake ? you might want to use the on-screen shutter to prevent that (since there?s no auto-focus, using the virtual key is not a problem at all).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7?s bottom side features just the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back we find the camera, dual-LED flash and loudspeaker banded together on a silver strip. The camera doesn?t protrude like on the N8 but when you put the phone down it rests on it, perhaps making it prone to scratches (there?s no lens cover).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though there are two symmetrical grills, only one of them (the one next to the lens) is an actual loudspeaker ? the other one is there just for design symmetry, we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is metal and very pleasant to the touch. It?s held in place by a latch found at the bottom. Adjacent to the latch is the second microphone, which is used for noise cancellation - you should be careful not to cover it with your palm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping the cover open reveals the 1200mAh Li-Ion battery (BL-5K).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is quoted at up to 552 hours of stand-by (2G, 648 hours in 3G) or up to 9 and a half hours of talk time (and 5h in 3G). In real life we managed to squeeze just about two days of moderately heavy use out of the handset ? just like we did with the Nokia N8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Nokia C7 is very good ? the phone feels very solid even if it?s not mostly made of metal. By the way, the metal and plastic on the back are good quality indeed and do blend well. The front and its faux silver frame are less pleasant though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, shedding off a couple of millimeters compared to the N8 makes the Nokia C7 comfortable to hold and very pocketable. The non-protruding camera module helps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The Symbian^3 user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 is the second Symbian^3-powered device we get to take a closer look at. We?ve been on and on about Nokia needing to catch up with Android and iOS. The new version of Symbian is certainly a step in the right direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We installed Symbian Anna - check out our impressions over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Finnish software engineers finally realized that it?s a streamlined interface that people want and got rid of the whole tap-to-select-another-tap-to-confirm nonsense that made Symbian^1 so inconsistent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Symbian^3 is a definite improvement for Nokia but it?s obvious they couldn?t have gone for a complete overhaul like Microsoft. That would?ve meant losing a lot of functionality and is probably the reason why the Finns went the evolutionary, rather than the revolutionary way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo video of Symbian ^3 running on the Nokia C7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian^3 does bring both visual and functionality changes. The homescreen is the most evident of those, its size now expanded to three panes worth of space. You are free to fill it up with widgets and reshuffle them as you see fit. If three panes are too much for you, you can delete the ones you don?t need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You might notice that the homescreen panes start scrolling only after you have completed your swipe across the screen but that?s how it was designed to be and not some lag. Some of the widgets are side-scrollable and the phone waits to see if you want to use them or skip to the next screen. Nokia has plans to fix that, as we?ve heard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if you want immediate response you can scroll them by tapping the three dot symbol at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is unchanged, retaining the hierarchical folder structure. This comes in contrast to Android, and mostly iOS, where you get a flat menu structure with all icons located on scrollable screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now you are free to rearrange icons as you see fit so you might go for placing them all in the main folder and get a flat-ish menu system from Symbian^3 too. A list view mode is also available but that involves much more scrolling and that?s why we preferred to leave things in grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager has also been changed and now shows screenshots of the running apps, instead of just icons. You also need only a single click to kill them this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance of the Symbian has also been taken up a notch with the ^3 version. The Nokia C7 feels snappy most of the time, with lags noticeable only when dealing with heavy apps or when there are a lot of apps running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even though heavy multi-taskers will frown at the 256MB of RAM we didn?t get any ?Out of memory? errors even when the camera and the web browser with two active tabs were running in background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the poor text input solution of Symbian^1 has been left unchanged by Symbian^3 and that?s probably our biggest grudge against the new OS (along with the web browser but we?ll come to that later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are talking about the virtual QWERTY, which takes you to a new screen to do your text input and gets you back when you?re done typing. That adds an extra step each time you need to do some typing. Not quite the simplicity we all want, is it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we have to point out that Symbian^3 is less inclined to skimp on the eye-candy as opposed to its predecessors. There are icons bumping and revolving, menus being opened with a zoom in and out effects and the occasional fading in and out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s again not quite up with the best, but considering that after some time too much effects become a nuisance we won?t be taking too many points away here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is pretty good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 comes with a fully functional phonebook, which can easily be synced with your exchange account. Symbian has been offering users virtually unlimited phonebook capacity and excellent contact management for quite some time. Now it is starting to add some social network integration too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting some of your contacts as favorites moves them to the top of the displayed list. This saves you quite a lot of scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign personal ringtones and videos to individual contacts. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really nice touch when editing a contact?s details is the option to enter their address by locating it on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The social network integration includes Facebook and Twitter, which should be fine for the vast majority of users. However you will need to go an extra step to check out your contact?s status and then another one to see their profile. We agree it might have created a mess if that was all added to the already lengthy phonebook profile but one of those extra steps is probably a bit too much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any call-related issues with the Nokia C7. Reception is solid, voice quality good on both ends of a call. The earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. There?s a second microphone used for active noise-cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice dialing is available on the C7 and gets activated by pressing and holding the call key on the home screen. It is fully speaker-independent and as far as we can tell performs greatly, recognizing all the names we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In noisier environments though, its effectiveness might suffer. Bear in mind too, that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a contact, the system will dial either the default number or the first in the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is also here, practical as ever. You just punch in a few letters from the desired contact?s name and select it from the list that comes up to initiate a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final option for starting a call is via the Favorites widget on your homescreen. The C7 has the neat accelerometer-based feature that lets you mute the ringer by turning the phone face down. That same turn-to-mute trick also works for snoozing your alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the screen turns off automatically when you hold the phone next to your cheek during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 sat our traditional loudspeaker test. The phone did well there too. The Good mark it snatched means it should be loud enough for nearly every situation. More info on the test, as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid messaging deserves a better keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 can easily cater for all your messaging needs, but chances are you will find the virtual keyboard rather annoying. It?s not so much the QWERTY keyboard itself, which is spacious and comfortable but the fact that it opens in a separate screen with a dedicated text box. There?s no multi-touch support here either so two-handed typing is likely to produce more thumbos than usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that nuisance is not exclusive to the messaging department ? it?s the way the keyboards function throughout the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All your incoming messages arrive in a common inbox. If you like, you can also get them sorted as conversations, in threaded view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 relies on a shared editor for all the types of messages. Stuff like a character counter in SMS goes without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Insert some multimedia content the message is automatically transformed into an MMS. In that case, the character counter turns into a data counter showing kilobytes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 email client allowed us to setup our Gmail account quite easily, while getting it to sync with an Exchange ActiveSync server took a couple of tries. In most cases though, all you need is to enter a username and a password and you will be good to go in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia C7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can be filtered by various criteria such as date, sender, subject, priority or even by attachments, searching is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available. This can save you some data charges since you can use the next available WLAN connection instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments, signatures and basically everything you would normally need on a mobile device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid file management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike some competing platforms, Symbian handsets have always enjoyed a proper file manager. The File manager on board the C7 is a capable app that can basically do anything you can think of with your files - moving, copying renaming, sorting or sending - you name it. You can also password-protect your memory card if you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for a specific file or directory. All you need to remember is a part of the desired name and where it was located (phone memory or memory card), the Nokia C7 will find it in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With USB on-the-go enabled on the Nokia C7, you can also use the file manger to access USB flash drives and even other phones connected over the optional USB cable. Of all the USB flash drives we tried to connect, the C7 only failed with one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Non-Nokia handsets wouldn?t communicate with the C7 too. We tested an Android handset, an iPhone and even a Bada device and they all started charging but wouldn?t connect in mass storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we plugged the other end of the USB cable in a Nokia E71 though, its memory card immediately popped up inside the C7 file manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Boring image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian^3 might have vastly improved the UI but the gallery was definitely not on the upgrade list. The Nokia C7 comes with virtually the same image browsing software as its predecessors and, honestly, it?s barely passable by modern standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, sweep gestures have been available for a while now and you are also getting pinch-zooming now with the C7 so it?s not all bad but some eye-candy would have been more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you?ve zoomed on an image however, there?s no kinetic scrolling and panning and that?s sure to cost the C7 a few points. On the positive side, opting between portrait and landscape mode is automatic, thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the familiar pinch gesture you can also zoom in by double taping, the volume rocker or even the on-screen slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selection of multiple photos for deleting or sharing is available straight in the gallery. Unfortunately, sharing is only available via MMS, email or Bluetooth with no image sharing service integration. We guess that can be easily fixed by installing the necessary uploading profiles for the services you?re interested in. At least that?s how it works on non-touch Symbian smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features of the image gallery include the image tagging system for easier image sorting, the slide show and the albums system (again helping you sort your image database).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, picture browsing is relatively fast even with 8MP pics, but zooming is somewhat slow. You need to wait for a second or two every time you start zooming in on a photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is looking better already<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian never had trouble with the music player features but its looks were far from impressive. With Symbian^3 however Nokia introduces a new Cover Flow-like interface, which adds the much needed eye-candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s automatic sorting by artist, album, genre and the option to create custom playlists straight on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the huge number of supported formats, equalizer presets and effects the feature set is complete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case you can control it through the music player widget on the homescreen, which also displays the currently running track.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's not much that separates the Nokia C7 audio output from the one of the Nokia N8. Just like the Nokia multimedia flagship, the C7 achieved great scores in our traditional test and is quite loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When attached to an active external amplifier (i.e. your car stereo or your home audio system), the Nokia C7 performs greatly with no weak points whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There wasn't much quality deterioration when we plugged in the headphones either. Sure, the stereo crosstalk got a bit worse (but surprisingly the drop wasn't as big as with the N8) and we recorded some intermodulation distortion, but those are rather hard to detect in anything but lab conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C7 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is impressive, could use some subtitles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to video playback on Symbian smartphones, the Nokia C7 is still among the lucky few to have DivX and XviD support out of the box. And it doesn?t stop there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The playback was silky smooth on all files with a resolution up to and including 720p, which is quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The media player app itself only works in fullscreen landscape mode but, since anything else would have made the widescreen display useless, this is understandable. In fullscreen mode, a tap on the screen shows the controls, which are otherwise hidden. The amply sized high-contrast screen is also more than welcome for truly enjoying your videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some restrictions do apply though. For one the handset cannot play any file that is larger than 2GB and you cannot fast forward and rewind ones larger than 1.5GB. If you manage to keep your files below that limit (which basically excludes full-length 720p HD movies) you will be fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other problem with the video player is the lack of any kind of subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Nokia C7 does extremely well on the video playback front but is certainly not perfect. Nokia should be able to address all those little shortcomings in some future software updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And in the Web TV section you'll find a handful of apps giving you access to the latest news as well as to movie trailers or even whole episodes of various TV shows. The apps here include YouTube, CNN Video, National Geographic, and Paramount Pictures' Movie Teasers applications. Of course, each of them requires internet connection (over 3G/3.5G or Wi-Fi) and note that not all content is free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio comes with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia C7 has the same neat and simple interface as on its Symbian^1 predecessors. You can search skip preset and new stations alike with sweep gestures or you can use the virtual buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C7 has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency. This means that if you travel, the C7 should hopefully be able to auto-tune to your selected radio station.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS is the best part of C7 radio app. The radio station name gets displayed with cool effects across the whole screen, while the rest of the readings are printed in nicely legible font at the bottom.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>An FM transmitter is on board, too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia C7 is among the few phones to come with a built-in FM transmitter. This cool feature allows you to stream the music on your phone to any standard FM radio receiver nearby at a frequency of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do is find an available frequency slot within the standard FM scale between 88.10MHz and 107.90MHz. Finding a position without radio interferences is harder in some places (big cities are usually radio polluted).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But whatever the case with the available frequencies, the FM transmitter app is simple enough to guarantee smooth and easy operation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should also keep the phone and the receiver within close distance or the signal quality quickly deteriorates. In our test we couldn?t afford moving any further than 2 meters away from the receiver but your mileage might vary.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixels of fixed-focus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 is equipped with an 8 megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. That sure sounds great at first but things are likely to change dramatically as soon as you realize there?s no auto-focus. Well, at least you do get a dual LED flash so night shots and video should be better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>High resolution and fixed-focus is a combo that doesn?t seem to make much sense. As a matter of fact, the images produced turned out as bad as we feared. On top of that, the camera interface is far from user-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are only three shortcuts available in the viewfinder. Those allow you to toggle camcorder and still camera, set the flash and access the rest of the customizable settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would have made much more sense if some of those settings were brought on the sides of the viewfinder too as it would have saved us a few clicks, but Nokia engineers didn't think so. Not to mention that the extra camera settings are the only part of the interface where you can still ?enjoy? the single-tap-double-tap routine that plagued the previous version of the Symbian touch interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the basic functionality is mostly there. On the C7 you?re in charge of white balance, color tone, exposure, ISO, contrast and sharpness. You can also go for one of the preset scene modes and there is an option for creating a custom scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Face detection is also available on the Nokia C7. As for geotagging, it lets you record your current location in the EXIF information of the photos, using the built-in GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the image quality, we must say we expected way more from the C7. The aggressive noise reduction smudges fine detail, there are plenty of oversharpening artifacts to see as well as softness in the extreme corners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of that, there?s a greenish tint in the upper half of the images which somehow gradates into pink tint in the lower half. It?s most easily visible on the chart photos below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 05 Nov: To redeem the Nokia C7 here are a couple of shots taken with the sharpness set to a lower, more acceptable level. As you can see, most of the artifacts seen on the previous samples are now gone so the result is definitely more pleasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With sharpness tuned down, photos turned out for the better so much so that we actually went ahead and shot a comparative shot with the XPERIA X10. The Nokia C7 is actually quite on par with the XPERIA X10 - except in closeup shots, of course where the fixed focus C7 loses by a wide margin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the major missing feature ? autofocus ? becomes apparent when you try taking a closeup shot. Anything closer than 50cm is a no-go and to give you a perspective, to fill the frame with a standard A4 sheet you need to get as close as 30cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact due to the strong noise reduction smaller text fonts are hardly legible even when the text is in focus, so making nice shots of documents and leaflets is a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Theoretically, the 8 megapixel sensor allows you to shoot from further way and then crop (or zoom in) to see the details you're interested in. You can't do that with a 3 megapixel fixed focus camera. But the heavy noise reduction on the C7 is harsh on the fine details (such as fine print) so it's still not up to the task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of samples that demonstrate how poor the C7 is with close ups. One is shot from approximately 50cm - the minimum focus distance - while the other is shot from even closer so we can fill the frame with the A4 sheet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia C7. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording was a nice surprise<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 shoots in 720p resolution at 25 fps and offers digital image stabilization. Clips are stored as MP4 files. The poor still camera performance led us to expect poor performance here as well, however we were in for a nice surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As opposed to the N8, image processing is obviously more aggressive. They were going for more "punch" instead of a more natural look to videos and it should work fine for the target audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, the videos shot with the Nokia C7 did manage to impress us. The amount of resolved detail is good enough, colors look nice, noise levels are kept reasonably low. They are perhaps even better than those produced by the XPERIA X10 after it got its HD-touting 2.1 update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price of the lower compression affects the file size ? 10 seconds of video take about 16 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally you get a smart digital zoom in video mode just like on the Nokia N8. It means that you can zoom in to about 2.5x without losing detail. It's pretty impressive if you think about it and the fact that the C7 is one of the very few handsets to have it earns it an extra point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video-recording capabilities of the C7 make up big time for the poor still imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video sample from the Nokia C7 ? 720p@25fps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even mid-range smartphones have excellent connectivity options these days and it would?ve been strange if Nokia C7 failed to deliver. Fortunately, it has no reasons to feel embarrassed ? the phone supports almost every data transfer option you would need and then some more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, all kinds of network connectivity options are at your disposal - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSPA (10.2 Mbps HSDPA and 2.0 Mbps HSUPA). The GSM/EDGE networking comes in quad-band flavor and the 3G covers all the five bands available worldwide ? 850/900/1700/1900/2100 MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB is version 2.0, with the standard microUSB port capable of charging the phones besides transferring data. We already covered the USB on-the-go functionality, but just for the record, we had almost 100% success of connecting USB flash drives and other Nokia phones, but that?s about it. The Nokia C7 didn?t connect to card readers and phones by other makers. Unlike the N8, though, the C7 doesn?t come along with an USB on-the-go adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth connectivity is version 3.0 with stereo support and there's a WirelessN-enabled Wi-Fi radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot can be used for transferring data to and from your C7. It?s under the battery though and no hot-swap is a nuisance. However both the memory card and the internal memory are accessible when you connect the handset to a computer in Mass storage mode and we managed to get speeds north of 10 MB/s when transferring data this way. That means you?d hardly ever need to use an external card reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the record, the Nokia C7 lacks the microHDMI port, found on the N8.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Symbian^3 didn?t deliver the browser overhaul that the platform needs desperately. Despite the added multi-touch and FlashLite 4.0 support, the C7 can just watch helplessly as the Android Froyo speeds away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, 24.08.2011: We installed Symbian Anna - check out our impressions of the new browser over here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the good things, the Nokia C7 browser has good page rendering and offers some nice features such as different font sizes (5 options), auto fill-in of web forms and a password manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flash Lite 4.0 support is enough for playing flash videos, but it?s not quite as impressive a performer as the desktop-grade Adobe Flash 10.1 for Android Froyo. You can also choose to switch Flash off to cut down on loading times and save some data traffic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find-on-page feature enables keyword search. The visual history is a nice bonus that can help you find a page you've visited more easily. There's also a popup blocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser won?t let you open a new tab unless you hit a pop-up link. We'd have really preferred to see an option to open links in a new window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double tapping on a chunk of text zooms it in on screen, but again, the text doesn't auto fit to the smaller viewport and you still need to scroll sideways.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the worst parts of the C7 web browser is entering a web address, which can take up to four steps, while most competing platforms do it with one ? hell, some even do it with voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, generally speaking, the Symbian^3 browser is hardly a better copy of its S60 predecessor and that?s certainly to the C7 detriment. Internet browsing has never been more popular and until Nokia did something about the usability of their browser, their smartphones will be getting quite a lot of stick for it. Sure, we?ve heard Nokia has plans to update it on all Symbian ^3 devices in the future. We?re yet to see how it goes then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now, if we could give you an advice here, we?d say get the latest Opera Mobile up and running on you C7 and use the default browser only when you need to access Flash content. The hassle of using two apps for the same purpose is still better than having to deal with the S^3 web browser shortcomings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian^1 used to have a pretty decent organizer already so all Nokia needed to do is tune it up a bit and slightly polish the touch experience. And that?s exactly what they did ? by taking the same streamlined approach as with the rest of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and a to-do list, which allows you to check all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are three types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has some specific fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 also allows you to browse office documents thanks to the preinstalled Quickoffice application. The Adobe PDF reader is also here to take care of those .PDF files, while the ZIP manager allows you to deal with digital archives on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the preinstalled Quickoffice version doesn?t support editing, but we doubt much of the C7 target audience will need it anyway. If you insist, you can get the paid upgrade and enable editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator application is very familiar but it lacks the functionality of some of its competitors. The square root is the most advanced function it handles and this is hardly an achievement. If all you do with it is split the bill at the bar though, you're more than good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a dictionary, voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. The good unit converter we?ve come to know from Symbian^1 is strangely gone but you can grab one yourselves from the Ovi store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, set-off day and repeat pattern. As we already mentioned, thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone over.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian is still the best selling smartphone OS worldwide, but you won?t be able to tell that just by browsing the application stores of the different platforms. The Ovi store is way behind the Android Market, let alone the market-leading App Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet there are signs recently that Nokia are realizing the importance of apps to modern smartphone users. The company has refreshed their Ovi store interface to make it more user-friendly and it is finally making some serious effort to attract more developers. With such a huge user-base, success is merely a matter of time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are already a few thousand apps in the store and chances are that the most important apps will be there soon enough. Catching up with the best won?t be easy though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can browse the apps available in the Ovi Store by categories ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections ? Go Green, Tools for Professionals, Homescreen Apps, Highly Addictive Games and Web TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps record of all the apps you have installed under My stuff. You can now also select where games and apps should be installed and where audio and video should go. That?s nice ? we wish Android had that right from the start.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Maps comes with free lifetime navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C7 comes with a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a satellite lock from a cold start (A-GPS turned off) in just over two minutes. Keeping the lock from then on was not an issue for the C7 even in a dense urban environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably know since the start of the year Nokia made their Ovi Maps navigation free for all their smartphones, which naturally includes the C7. The voice guidance is currently available in over 70 countries and over 40 different languages, with even traffic information for more than 10 of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Nokia did a pretty decent job of the Ovi Maps application itself, blessing it with a cool, touch-friendly interface, as well as nice features such as the Lonely planet city guide, HRS hotels and the Michelin restaurant guide. There's also an Event guide that lists all that?s happening within a 3km range of your position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Ovi Maps 3.04 you get three different view modes including satellite and terrain maps. Those however do need an internet connection. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand and can be used with preloaded maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Routes can be set to either fastest or shortest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia C7 is a nicely made handset with an extra thin profile. Maybe it?s too rounded for our taste, or maybe it?s just us. This cool cat provides distinct E-series styling and the no-nonsense C-series attitude in a package that means business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5-inch screen is surely among the best touch displays we?ve seen from Nokia (we have yet to check out a Nokia Clear Black display). The HD videos produced by the camera are a treat to watch ? on the handset itself and on a computer screen. You can also put the mobile display to good use with some DivX/XviD videos as those are seamlessly supported. The excellent audio output quality and the great connectivity package also set the C7 apart - you rarely see penta-band 3G, WirelessN, Bluetooth 3.0, an FM transmitter, TV-out and USB-on-the-go functionality all in one device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stills from the 8MP fixed-focus camera on board the C7 were a definite downer but nearly everything else works just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest iteration of Symbian clearly shows Nokia?s will to change and improve, but there are still ghosts from the past that we discover when we dig deeper in the user interface ? such as the camera UI or the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, we do believe that Nokia will continue to better Symbian so it catches up with the standard-setters. And there is much to catch up on ? the competition, the iOS, the Android OS, even Bada OS ? they are still ahead when it comes to handling. Application-wise the Ovi Store is not in the lead, but it?s still growing well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, the Nokia C7 can be purchased for a bit less than 350 euro. That, considering the phone?s great feature set (with some reservations) and the fact that the handset has just hit the market, sounds fair enough. Actually, this is how much you would have to spend if you want to get another Symbian^3-based smartphone, the Nokia C6-01 which is just hitting the market as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Feature-wise, the C6-01 is almost identical to the Nokia C7. Both run the Symbian^3, sport 8MP fixed-focus snappers, offer diverse connectivity options and come with AMOLED capacitive touchscreens on board. However, while the C7 has a 3.5-incher, the display of the C6-01 only measures 3.2 inches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C6-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a few more bucks you could get the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10, which has just got its long awaited update to Android 2.1 or the Motorola MILESTONE XT720, which runs Eclair as well. Both of them pack 8MP snappers with autofocus and 720p HD video recording. Of course, you could also go for the Froyo-serving HTC Desire which only has a 5 megapixel AF camera but it shoots HD videos too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 ? Motorola MILESTONE XT720 ? HTC Desire</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently unveiled Samsung S8530 Wave II should start selling later this month for about 350 euro. It is based on Samsung?s Bada platform and like its predecessor, the Samsung S8500 Wave, features a 5MP autofocus camera with 720p videos enabled. This time around, you get a 3.7? Super Clear LCD display instead of a 3.3? Super AMOLED. Oh, and the Wave II runs the latest Bada OS 1.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S8530 Wave II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the only true C7 rival is Nokia itself. If it went for a better camera, the phone?s future would?ve been way brighter. You?ve heard that before and you?ll hear it once again: when it comes to digital cameras, it?s NOT the megapixels that count but the image quality. And the C7 image quality fails to impress. And the missing autofocus is only one of the reasons for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, there are enough other reasons to go for the Nokia C7. It has the potential of a bestseller and now it?s up to Nokia and the upcoming software updates to unlock it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian Anna debuted a while ago with the Nokia X7 and the E6 but the original quartet of new generation Nokia phones that initially launched with Symbian^3 now gets to join in on the fun as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put a Nokia N8 through the update process and fiddled with it - then we decided you might be interested in a quick Symbian^3 vs. Symbian Anna comparison. X7 and E6 owners might not, but if you have a Nokia N8, C7, C6-01 or E7 you should check this out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start off with how your phone to update to Anna. And while it's going through the process, you can read through the rest of this article to see what changes you can expect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Getting Symbian Anna<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before we start comparing Anna to its ^3 predecessor, we'll go over how to update to Anna first. If you've bought an X7 or an E6, you're all set, but those who have the Symbian^3 Nokias need to do this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that Anna is officially out, the simplest way to update is straight on the phone. Get to the Device updates screen (either from Settings or by entering *#0000# into the dialer). Hit Options and choose Check for updates. After the phone confirms there is new software available, hit accept and enjoy Anna after the update process finishes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another way is to use the SW update app, which can be set to check for new update automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is to use Ovi Suite. After connecting your phone, Ovi Suite will check for updates (you can do it manually too) and will show a notification on the top row of buttons. It's a good idea to do a backup of your phone before you start - you have Ovi Suite connected anyhow, best to be safe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're on a Mac, you have Nokia Software Updater at your disposal. It works just like Ovi Suite - connect the phone, app will check for updates and apply them if it finds any.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface changes - better text input, little else<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It may not be immediately apparent to the untrained eye just what exactly Anna does to the homescreen to give it a nudge in the direction of usability. But after using it for a bit, you start to notice things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We shot a new video of the user interface - check out Anna running on the N8:.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new style icons might be the first thing that hits you - the simple, rounded icons are a god new look for Symbian - or it could be that scrolling the homescreen is much more tangible. You "push" the homescreen sideways and it moves, instead of the old homescreen that moved only after you've finished with your swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other things haven?t changed however - the hierarchical menu that is a throwback to a past era is still here. You can rearrange your icons, but the flat menu structure that iOS and Android have popularized is hard to achieve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager that only fits three apps at a time hasn?t changed either - landscape mode offers much more space but it still only fits three. If you're not in the habit of closing your apps, you'll have to do quite a bit of scrolling to switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one UI change that really makes Anna a must-have for Nokia owners is the new text input - lo and behold the split screen keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In previous versions of Symbian you had two options - go to a new screen to enter your text on a full-screen landscape QWERTY and then go back or use that tiny, movable QWERTY keyboard that was basically a pain in the butt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anna however enables the portrait QWERTY, which overlays the bottom half of the screen and lets you stay in the app and type simultaneously. Besides letting you enter text without flipping the phone to its side and without going back and forth in the UI, it enables more subtle changes - like autosuggestion in the web browser that actually works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys on the portrait QWERTY are a bit small, despite the available screen estate. Still, you can activate word prediction, which will fix the word you're trying to type and show a small popup with the word you actually typed, in case you're trying to enter something like a user name (which doesn?t have to be a valid word, in fact word prediction in this case gets in the way).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape QWERTY keyboard is also available in split-screen mode and it offers bigger, easier to hit keys, making it the preferred option for entering long text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it's not perfect - several apps would popup the old text edit screen, covering the app screen even though we were using the portrait QWERTY. The Ovi store app is an example of where that happens, which was a little disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while Symbian Anna isn't a huge change in the interface department, it does sand away some of the rough edges of Nokia's aging OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, some of the native apps also received an update, which improved the general functionality of the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Native Symbian apps were updated too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The most noticeable change is in the web browser - it's a lot user friendlier now, with its proper URL bar (thanks split-screen QWERTY!), the always visible back button (vital for navigating web pages) and things like manually opening new tabs (before Anna the only way to open a new tab was to set a link open in a new tab).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are changes we've been expecting for ages and we cheered when Nokia put them in the X7 and E6. And now, Nokia's first wave of new Symbians can enjoy it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But Anna is not Froyo - Flash is still pretty much no-go on Symbian, with only Flash Lite 4 supported. So, no watching YouTube videos in-browser or playing Flash games. And the new interface, as much as it improves on the old one, is still miles behind Mobile Safari and the Android browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another native Symbian app that got a major improvement is Nokia Maps, which went up to version 3.06. That's the version you get with the new OS update, but v3.06 is available for older Symbian versions and older phones too, so you'll only see a difference if you haven't updated Maps separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the new version brings a redesigned menu and improved search functionality. Also, public transport lines are available on the maps with the new version and you can download country maps directly on the phone (you no longer need a computer to do that). Social network check-ins are also part of the new package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of SNS skills, Anna adds a few niceties here too - you can check out the latest status updates by your friends in their contact cards in the phonebook, you can upload high-res images and add captions to them too. Retweeting has also been added as an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Store has been updated and can now download bigger apps over Wi-Fi but there are no visual changes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian hasn?t seen any groundbreaking changes in its recent history and Anna isn't one either - like the jump from ^1 to ^3, it's an incremental update that improves things but leaves some rough edges untouched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't get us wrong - Anna is the best that Symbian has to offer right now (until Belle arrives anyway) and people with an N8, a C7, C6-01 or E7 should update as soon as possible - the browser alone is a good enough reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>N8 owners have a special incentive too - with Anna installed, they can apply the camera update and enjoy 30fps videos with continuous autofocus (and a slightly better UI). Let's face it, people bought N8s chiefly for its camera, so Nokia continuing to improve it is commendable. We've covered that in another post.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the number of things left that need changing is much longer than the list of things that have changed. On the other hand, after Nokia announced they'll be focusing on Windows Phone 7, we were worried about Symbian's future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It turns out those worries were unfounded - with Anna out now and Belle just around the corner (and there are 1GHz Symbian devices out too), Symbian seems more alive now than it was a year ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a long way to go before it catches up to Android, but we'll be following it (and reviewing it) every step of the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What are your impressions - is there still fight left in Symbian or are these updates just a stopgap measure while we're waiting for the Nokia-made WP7 phones to show up?</paragraph>
