			<paragraph>New Samsung launches were in the spotlight on Monday, at a grand presentation in London, UK. The British Museum hosted Samsung's rendezvous with history, with the company's top brass celebrating key achievements and marking the brand's mobile strategy. Paul Wilkens, Sales and Marketing Director for Telecommunications, pointed out that the sales for the 3rd quarter of 2007 are at an all-time high with 42.6M units sold. The South Korean company seems to be getting a firm hold of the 2nd spot in market share and revenue among mobile phone manufacturers, a few months after it took it away from Motorola. It is also clear that in some parts of Europe Samsung is already leading. In France, Samsung mobiles have reached a 31.8% market share shooting them at the very top. The French head of Telecom Division Philippe Barthelet however refused to take credit and instead attributed it to the taste of the French for stylish handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung made it clear that the brand will continue to focus on four strategic multimedia categories: Photography, Music, Internet and Business. Each category is represented in the new releases, which have been stealing the spotlight for quite a while now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GSMArena traveled to the British capital to bring you first hand information, so stay with us for an exclusive update on what seem to be a bunch of exciting launches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Following a welcome address by Samsung Electronics Europe President and CEO IS Kim, the handsets came on stage for a detailed presentation. The star was undoubtedly the 5-megapixel Samsung G800. More after the jump.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>A total of 10 handsets were set on display at the British Museum, all with specific expertise in one of the key Samsung categories. Photography, Music, Internet and Business were duly covered, adding a pinch of Armani flair. We first got our hands on the Samsung G800, called - quite audaciously - the Professional Camera by Samsung. The first impression was of a quite ample girth. But leaving the generous size aside, Samsung's best equipped cameraphone to date is really sleek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal looks and high build quality really make it stand out among its Samsung siblings, never mind the interface has remained almost unchanged. The camera interface was pepped up a bit, though in the very little time we had with it, we didn't notice significant changes in functionality compared to other Samsung models. The optical zoom is surely to make a difference and the Face Detection Auto Focus really contributes to the digicam-like experience. By the way, we were quite impressed with the way the optical zoom behaved. The zooming mechanism is stunningly smooth and quiet. Finally, as our photos show, the wide dynamic range (WDR) optimization may just turn out to be more than a mere marketing gimmick.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Focus on Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ranks of Samsung music-oriented phones will receive the biggest number of reinforcements. The smart Samsung i450 is the first in line featuring the not so frequent dual slide design. Furthermore, when the front panel is slid down a very cool navigational solution gets revealed. A touch sensitive semi-circle makes browsing your music files much easier and more fun. It really resembled the Navi wheel we saw on Nokia N81, although we found its location on i450 to be somewhat uncomfortable. In fact, it suggests that the music player should be operated with both hands, which doesn't quite match our taste. Anyway, leaving that aside, we ought to mention that in addition to the music capabilities, Samsung i450 has the features of a fully-functional Symbian S60 smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another phone of music spirit is Samsung F330 - except for the ultra sleek looks, there is nothing that special about it. The specification highlights of the tri-band phone include 3G (HSDPA 3.6 Mbps) support and a dedicated Bang &amp; Olufsen audio chip. The dedicated music keys and FM radio only nicely complement the musical image of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last musician to join Samsung band is F210 - another impressive model but, just as F330, mostly in terms of looks. The uncommonly compact swivel really does look like a dedicated mp3 player. It wasn't that much of a novelty though as its photos leaked not so long ago. Its musical benefits include 3.5mm audio jack and the energizing onboard memory capacity of 1GB, plus a microSD card slot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>For the busy bees<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Two Samsung business-oriented phones were presented - the i550 and i560 smartphones. Surprisingly enough, the i780 smartphone was sorted under the internet mobile solutions instead, so we will come to it later on. The device we spent a bit more time with was Samsung i550 - a Symbian smartphone with a built-in GPS receiver. The built-in Trackball Navigation Key was almost the same as the one we've seen in RIM Blackberry models. Another noteworthy thing was the fact that both Symbian devices were rather different in looks from most Nokia models sporting the same OS. The theme used was the reason, and our impression is that Samsung have done a nice job with it. Anyway, as this is not something of great importance, let's move to the next phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i560 seemed a slider version of the i550, rather than a truly distinct device. We only noticed a few minor differences, which we were prepared to look for knowing the specs of both devices. No trackball here but, as we see it, both phones are equally well operated and user-friendly. The 3.5 mm audio jack is however a nice thing to have. On the other hand, it doesn't seem the most businesslike of functions, but is still a good thing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet power<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have to admit, the Internet-labeled devices were by far among the most interesting. Samsung F700 and Samsung i780 are the new star signings in the company's mobile portfolio and were both keen to impress us in one way or another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung F700 is a flash-based device with full QWERTY sliding keyboard. Only a quick glance revealed it is far thicker than it looked on the official photos. However the rotating flash interface deserves praise. It is very intuitive and easy to work with and therefore is sure to earn itself quite a number of fans. On the other hand, it bears significant resemblance to the LG flash interface used in the Prada and KU990 Viewty phones. The keys on the QWERTY keyboard are smaller than we imagined but still very comfortable for typing. Based on our short experience, we can give an excellent mark on the messaging and all other typing-related activities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other internet-centered device, Samsung i780 sports a large square display with great picture quality and Optical Joystick that controls a fully functional mouse pointer on the screen. There are three different scrolling speeds, to suit every taste. Unfortunately, due to the fact that the event was indoors, we were unable to test the GPS and the built-in Navigation client.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>For the fashion-savvy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The last two devices showcased in London were the fashion proposals by Samsung. The Giorgio Armani and Serenata phones are both produced in joint venture, Giorgio Armani and Bang and Olufsen contributing to the two, arguably best looking handsets in Samsung's portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our guess is that Samsung Serenata will hardly live up to the expectations. The incredibly thick phone is quite uncomfortable to hold and almost impossible to squeeze in any pocket. Besides, the design somehow failed to impress us in the beginning and our first-hand encounter confirmed that. Still, fashion is solely a matter of taste, so everyone that is about to buy this phone should judge for themselves. And finally, it's a lifestyle gadget, with a price tag meaningful enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other fashion-labeled Giorgio Armani phone however did manage to grab our attention. It feels great when held in hand and the large touch-operated display makes it look even smaller than it actually is. There is no second battery in the leather case regardless of the tradition of the Samsung P-series. We remind you that when the phone was initially announced, it was named P520. Anyway, the phone features the same flash interface as F700 and is, as we see it, destined to enjoy a great demand. Mostly with the fashion-phone lovers, that is. It's also said that the handset will be a free gift to everyone who buys one of the selected Armani suits in their fashion stores.</paragraph>
