			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung are really taking tablets seriously these days. They already have three offerings this year. The other two are more compact, but it's the Galaxy Tab 10.1 that will lead the team ahead in enemy territory. The trio surely has one hard task ahead of them, but let's see how the eldest brother fares now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The largest of the company's tablets offers more screen estate and larger battery, while at the same time maintaining the impressively slim waistline. There?s a Tegra 2 chipset ticking under the hood so you get the latest and greatest in mobile chipset technology.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 3G at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 is nothing else, but a slightly larger 8.9 so the only question remaining is which one would suit your style better. And while we find the 8.9" size more versatile, it was the the 9.7-inch iPad that made the tablet class mainstream so it?s a good guess the Galaxy Tab 10.1 will probably have a wider reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus Samsung introduced some last minute touches to its largest slate, which should help it fare even better. At the eleventh hour the company announced that it will come with an even larger battery (7000mAh) and 30 grams lower weight than initially announced and that it will be getting DivX and XviD support. It seems like a good way to give an already competitive device an even bigger edge over its competitors (though in the case of the Tab 10.1 the edge is slimmer).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But those are all mostly guesses based on what the specs sheet of the device tells us. It's about time that we checked out its real-life performance and see if it will swing our opinion in another direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we move to the hardware part of this preview, here's hoping that the Galaxy Tab 10.1 won't disappoint as it's about time the iPad 2 got a worthy competitor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Designwise, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 is nothing but an enlarged copy of its smaller brother, the Galaxy Tab 8.9. Which is mostly good as it shares its marvelously slim waistline and high-tech vibe, but also has a shortcoming or two like the plastic battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet we?ll repeat our point about having a plastic construction being preferable over a possible increase in the weight. In fact it is even more valid here given that the larger 10.1 Galaxy Tab is good 35 grams below the 600 mark. Its nearest competitor, the Apple iPad 2, is 47 grams heavier, which is a good 10% difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And mentioning the iPad 2, we have to say that the Apple slate does have a slight edge in terms of design and overall feel. The Galaxy Tab strikes back with its easier handling due to its narrower body and slightly slimmer waistline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just have in mind that even at 565 the Galaxy Tab 10.1 isn?t too portable ? you will still need a place to rest your hands against or they will get tired pretty quickly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A gorgeous display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 is built around a 10.1? PLS LCD screen with a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels. The image quality and viewing angles of that display lives up to the high expectations for the PLS technology and ranks up with the best slates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still like the smaller Galaxy Tab 8.9 screen better, but that is to be expected given the higher pixel density. Plus we were pleasantly surprised to find that both slates are easily usable outside on a bright sunny day, even if colors do get a bit washed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, at this point, being able to see anything on a tablet screen when outside is considered a great achievement and the Galaxy Tab 10.1 is almost as good as it gets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 has no hardware controls whatsoever ? with the Honeycomb OS based solely on touch controls, the slate just doesn?t need them. All you get is the front-facing camera, embedded in the bezel around the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two short sides of the slates (left and right) when you hold it in its default landscape orientationare pretty boring too, having nothing but a speaker each. The placement of the stereo speakers on the opposing sides seems like a better solution than what we saw on the Galaxy Tab 8.9, where they were right next to each other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The reason for this is most probably that with the larger body, the Samsung engineers had more room for maneuvers and the freedom to place components optimally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the bottom of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 we find the proprietary 30-pin connector and the microphone pinhole. The Galaxy Tab 10.1 doesn?t have telephony support, but the microphone is still needed for voice and video-chatting. There are a bunch of Android apps that offer that kind of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We feel compelled to reiterate our usual gripes about proprietary ports ? if the Galaxy S II can do charging, HD TV-out and computer connectivity all through a single standard microUSB port, then why would Samsung need another type of port for these tablets. It might be a nice way for manufacturers to earn some money by selling accessories, but it?s not the most user-friendly solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And mentioning the accessories we got to spend some time with them too. The keyboard dock is pretty convenient packing lost of hardware shortcuts and allowing for comfortable two hand typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also got to try the USB host adapter, the SD card reader and the HDMI adapter. Have in mind that you will need a power cable to use the HDMI TV-out. Also a microSD card slot would have been much more appreciated than a card reader you need to purchase separately, but alas, we are in no luck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We now switch to the top where the 3.5mm audio jack and the SIM card slot are located. The SIM card slot was a bit hard to use on our pre-release unit but we expect this to be fixed in the final version of the device. This is also the only part of the device to feature any kind of hardware controls with the volume rocker and the power key near the left edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The journey ends at the back of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, which features the 3.15 megapixel camera lens and its low-light friend, the LED flash. Hardly a miracle-maker, the flash unit will probably make better use as a torch than provide serious shooting assistance. Then again serious shooting is not what springs to mind when you see a slate with a camera spec?d circa 2006.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll now have a brief look at the Galaxy Tab 10.1 user interface and some of its apps. Join us on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: stock Honeycomb now, TouchWiz later<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And while, size aside, hardware differences between the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Galaxy 8.9 are minimal, their software will be pretty different at launch. The larger tablet hits the shelves earlier (it?s actually just become available) and so the Samsung R&amp;D center couldn?t manage to get both Honeycomb 3.1 and their TouchWiz customization ready on time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are glad that they made the right call and prioritized getting the latest Android on the tablet. 3.1 Honeycomb should deal with the main problem plaguing the first Honeycomb tablets ? performance, so as useful as TouchWiz touches might have been, they had to make do without them at this release stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus the stock Honeycomb has a pretty well-designed and intuitive UI, as is to be expected from a platform designed from the ground up with tablets in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the usual software UI navigation keys in the bottom left corner ? back, home and task switcher, the search shortcuts on the top left, the app drawer on the top right and finally, but certainly not least importantly, the notification area in the lower right angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching works with both voice and text typed on the virtual keyboard. The homescreen should also pack another feature, which our pre-release tablet lacked ? resizable widgets. Not that we found ourselves running out of space with the default ones, but applications for Honeycomb will soon start pouring in and with time, you might find the screen too cramped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen works just like it did on the Motorola XOOM. Nicely modified to make better use of the larger screen, it gives you all five homescreen panes on top with four tabs available at the bottom - widgets, apps, wallpapers and ?more?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way you can grab a widget from the bottom tab and bring it to the desired homescreen pane on top. With smartphones you need to scroll screens if you want to place a widget on any other screen but the currently selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, unlike most of the smartphone droids, the tablets lack the option to pick the number of homescreen panes. Five might be a good number for some, but if you don?t need as many, they just slow up the navigation and if you need more, there?s just no way to get them. A To-Do for the Ice Cream sandwich prehaps?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is all stock Honeycomb too ? it?s split in two tabs ? All and My apps. The first one contains all the available apps, while the second one holds those installed by you. A press and hold on any of them will make the five homescreen panes appear so you can place a shortcut on whichever you might need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, we are pretty pleased with the usability of the Honeycomb interface. It is obvious that a lot of thought went into its design and it really is a notch above the competition in terms of functionality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike its smaller brother, the Galaxy Tab 10.1 will come with the stock Android music player with the TouchWiz customization here probably appearing at a later stage. This means that you will be able to enjoy the cool cover-flow-like browsing that we noticed on the XOOM, but you will be losing some of the functionality added by Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tracks can be sorted by album, artist, song, genre, playlist or just bring the new and recent additions on top. Naturally, there?s also a search option, which will be greatly appreciated by those with large music collections. It gets activated by pressing the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a specific album (or a group of tracks based on any filter) you get the familiar split screen interface. Album art, which is naturally supported, appears on the left along with the information about the compilation. The track list goes on the right and the currently playing track (if any) appears at the bottom with quick controls available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing screen offers shuffle and repeat (including repeat one) functionality, but no equalizers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if there is a track playing in background a dedicated row appears in the notification area showing its name. There are also quick pause or skip controls right there so you don?t need to open the music player every time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No dedicated video player yet, good potential though<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As the stock Android Honeycomb doesn?t have a dedicated video player app, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 early adopters will be forced to use the gallery for browsing their videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a bit irritating having to switch the gallery to video-only mode every time, but you will have to, if you have a lot of videos and/or images on-board. Yet this is just one more thing that will be fixed as soon as the software update hits and TouchWiz adds its own dedicated video player. In the meantime, you can snatch a Video player off the Android market too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the even better news is that Samsung promises DivX and XviD support for the Galaxy Tab 10.1 slate. Saving you the effort to convert each and every clip for watching it is vital to turning the slate into a really useful player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playback performance is pretty sleek and our pre-release Galaxy Tab 10.1 was already capable of doing 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you get the right accessories you will easily be able to output those videos to your HDTV and enjoy them the way they were meant to be so the potential seems all there. We are really hoping we won?t be made to regret those words when we get an actual retail Galaxy Tab 10.1 unit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser does a splendid job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you could probably figure out by now the Galaxy Tab 10.1 web browser has no customizations whatsoever. Nothing to regret here though as the Honeycomb browser is one nicely performing and functional app. There were a few glitches with our unit, but they were undoubtedly entirely down to its pre-release status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is neat and simple, yet powerful enough for all you needs and the full Flash support is more than welcome for experiencing browsing as it should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser and opening a new one is as easy as clicking the plus sign on the right. The address bar and search bar are, as usual for Android devices incorporated in a single field, which scores another point for the Tab 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks have their own screen and they can be organized in folders for easier navigation. History uses a split-screen interface letting you check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week. There?s also a Most visited tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing the browser with your desktop Google Chrome doesn?t need any extra software ? you check a box in the settings menu and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also auto-complete for forms and passwords and you can pick the default zoom level for the browser. Not that altering the zoom is that hard with pinch-zoom, naturally, being supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing that is missing here is the alternative interface that Motorola XOOM offered. We are talking about the quick access to your page controls (back, forward, refresh, bookmark etc.) by a swiping gesture performed near the right edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash performance on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 was, unsurprisingly, about identical to the one of the previous Tegra 2 devices we tested. This means that you will be able to watch 360p and even 480p Flash videos embedded right in the browser, but at least at this stage, 720p or higher resolutions are out of the question.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3.15 megapixel stills and 720p video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough, the camera interface is the only part of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 software package that was customized by Samsung. Given that the 3.15 megapixel snapper capable of doing 720p videos is hardly a key selling point of the device, we wonder if the effort wouldn't have been better invested elsewhere, but maybe it was an easy enough task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nonetheless, the two cameras are mostly there to provide the functionality needed for video-chatting and some augmented reality apps or games and the possibility to snap a label or two as a memory aid comes as a welcome bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is an oversized version of what you find on the Galaxy S II with the available settings on the left and the shutter key and the video/stills switch on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go a few samples to show you the image quality of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 camera. Have in mind that those were captured with a pre-release unit and the final unit will likely produce better snaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is not much different really. There are less options available here but the layout is basically the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a 720p video sample from the slate that we uploaded to YouTube. Once again you should remember that it's way too early to judge the image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 is certainly in the running for the best Android tablet of the year. Slim and sleek, it has a screen that is hard to match in quality by anything of comparable size and this tablet also has plenty of power under the hood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our personal preference still lies with its smaller 8.9? brother and its more complete TouchWiz experience, but the update is coming to the Tab 10.1 too and we are sure not everyone shares our thoughts about the size. And we can easily see why ? being able to enjoy the excellent picture quality on an extra 1.2 inches could be worth sacrificing some portability for a lot of people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there seems to be plenty of room in the 10.1? league for the largest Galaxy Tab to develop its potential. The XOOM is notably heavier and thicker and is yet unable to use its trump cards (the microSD slot and LTE support) due to unfinished software support, while the Eee Pad Transformer is in such limited supply that it is not making as much of an impact as we thought it would.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola XOOM</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet even if the Galaxy Tab 10.1 did win the Android finals, it probably won?t be good enough for its manufacturer. You see, Samsung likes to think big and that?s why they probably won?t consider the slate a success unless it manages to challenge the iPad throne and steal some of its thunder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, we cannot say how those two will really compare before we get a final unit of the Galaxy Tab and put Android 3.1 Honeycomb through its paces. The potential is all there, but we have to see it realized before we can wholeheartedly pass our judgment on this Android tablet compared to its iOS alternative.</paragraph>
