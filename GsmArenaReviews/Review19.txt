			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We can?t be sure but it does look like LG are still feeling the Android water before taking the plunge. Or they might just be too careful not to cast doubt on long standing commitments. You know, the soon-to-be Windows Phone 7. In any case though, their first Android attempts have enough in them to get us excited. The LG GT540 is not the kind of phone to make big headlines but fresh smartphone converts wouldn?t want a big-fuss, high-maintenance gadget anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 will not aim at the top-end where Motorola, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and HTC are battling it out, but will target more sensible users instead. Well-rounded connectivity and good design, with just the right touch of extravagance, will certainly open doors for the GT540. It can count of course on our warm reception but the exit will be entirely up to its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 30 Sept: The rollout of the Android 2.1 update for the LG GT540 Optimus has started in Europe. Check out our scoop and first impressions in our blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pet-named Optimus, the LG GT540 aims to give first time smartphone users the right balance of features in a friendly package. That?s really easier said than done. The GT540 is an entry-level smartphone and LG have no problem saying it out loud. It doesn?t look though like they?re lowering people?s expectations to give the phone an easier ride.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 forms a nice duet with the other LG Android-running handset, the GW620. Giving users a choice between QWERTY keyboard and compact size (and perhaps lower price) is great, while the extra development costs just shouldn?t have been too high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re about to see if the form factor change has had any consequences to the LG GT540 overall performance. One thing that?s sure to have changed are the ergonomics and we are to check those out right after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG GT540 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 is a reasonably sized handset, standing at 109 x 54.5 x 12.7 mm. It?s no big deal to comfortably find room for it in most pockets. It?s hardly too heavy (115.5 g) but this was to be expected in an all-plastic phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Back at the Barcelona MWC, we were not quite sure what to think of the LG GT540 design, but the curves work quite nice actually. Maybe it?s the black unit we?re reviewing that changed our minds. The finish on our unit (each color version has a differently styled surface) successfully imitates brushed aluminum and the time-tested black paintjob might not be the most creative but is certainly attractive nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high quality plastics used for the body of the LG GT540 also contribute to the overall design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Almost the whole front of the GT540 is taken by the 3? resistive touchscreen of HVGA resolution. The image quality of the TFT display is decent, although, as is to be expected in this price range, won?t blow you off your feet. The touchscreen is quite responsive for a resistive unit too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the sunlight legibility of the LG GT540 is disappointing. It?s not impossible to operate the phone outside on a bright sunny day, but it isn?t a pleasure either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we find the centrally located earpiece. There are no ambient light and proximity sensors on the GT540.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen there are a handful of buttons. Back and Menu are resistive touch-sensitive controls while the two call keys and the Home key are regular press buttons. It?s a bit confusing to use much like it is to explain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All of those keys are large enough and reasonably spaced to use comfortably, but the transition between touch and non-touch can be a little confusing at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the phone hosts only a volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right, you?ll find the dedicated camera key, the Search key and the microUSB port. The connectivity port is hidden under a small plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A short press on the search key will open the Quick Search Box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is on the small side but has good enough press. You can of course also use the virtual on-screen shutter key but it doesn?t have half-press and that makes taking photos awkward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top has nothing but the 3.5mm audio jack. We haven?t got the full retail package of the GT540 and have no idea what the supplied headset will be like. The standard audio jack however gives you unlimited choice of headphones to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic rear hosts the 3.2-megapixel autofocus camera lens. There is no protective cover but the lens is sunk and enclosed in a frame for food enough protection against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the rear cover but is luckily hot-swappable. The GT540 supports microSD and microSDHC cards. It had no problems handling our reasonably full 16GB microSDHC card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is impressive ? 1500mAh kept the LG GT540 running for nearly four days under regular use (half hour of browsing, half hour of telephony, taking a few pictures and briefly using the other features).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG GT540 handles nicely and the hardware controls are reasonably comfortable. It sits well in the hand and feels sturdy. We have our doubts about the durability of the back cover, which is slightly thinner than usual. If you?re careful enough not to drop it from a few meters height, it should last too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GT540 will also ship in white and pink, and the varied colors and distinctive styling of each color version suggests LG will be counting on robust demand from both male and female users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Upgraded Android UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 Optimus runs Android 1.6, which is yesterday?s news, but at least has been slightly retouched by LG. It?s not even close to the S-Class themed GW620. The only re-designed bits you get are the homescreen and the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you get three (or more) homescreens to put widgets, shortcuts and folders on. There are three non-customizable buttons at the bottom ? dialer, menu and messaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new addition coming with the LG Optimus theme is the variable number of homescreen panes. Initially, you get only three screens, but you can easily add another four to make room for your widgets. This and the arc-shaped buttons at the bottom remind us much of the HTC Sense UI organization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area, one of the Android strong points, got a tweak as well ? it has four switches for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 doesn?t have the standard set of Android controls. LG have decided instead to use only three ? home, back and the menu key. Now, you may think the Search key is missing but it?s just been relocated to the side ? and it makes sense actually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, pressing the menu key on the homescreen offers a Search option too, along with the usual commands like adding a widget, changing the wallpaper, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG customizations went a little further ? the main menu has been changed too. Much like on the GW620 you can group apps into categories. Unlike the GW620 however, the Optimus has no pre-defined categories and their number and names are left to the user to configure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the menu, you?ll find a little tool called Homescreen selector, which lets you pick between the stock vanilla Android homescreen and the custom LG Home. If LG Home is currently in use, you may access the selector directly from the homescreen options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard Android v1.6 widgets, LG has preloaded additional SNS ones ? updates, status and messaging. The trio helps you keep track of your friends? activities on Facebook, Twitter and Bebo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI on the LG Optimus is acceptably fast and has almost no lag, except occasional hiccups when the gallery gets overloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the LG GT540 Optimus compares to the HTC Hero in terms of performance. We used the free Benhcmark and PiBenchmark apps from the Android Market for the test and the results are here for you to see.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Another socialized phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android v1.6 has one single Contacts application to do all basic jobs ? Call log, Contacts, Groups and Favorites. The app uses a tabbed interface for easy navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the Contact list, there?s a Search Contacts button and an Add a new contact button. Another way to search for a contact is by using the alphabet scroll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact is listed with a photo, name, default phone number and a call button. Viewing a contact has been redesigned with social networking in mind. A tabbed interface is used here again. The default tab is View ? it shows all the contact info along with social networking related info (latest status, address, works, birthday, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the GW620, the Optimus won?t let you link every contact with different social-networking profiles You can only import contacts from Facebook, Twitter and Bebo. Unfortunately this won?t update your current entries; it will add new ones instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, once you?ve imported your friends? details from a social service, they will be linked permanently and will be updated regularly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is the Log ? it lists all communications with a given contact, from calls to Facebook messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is mostly unchanged. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes unneeded info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s take a look at the other three tabs in the main Contacts app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Groups tab hosts all of your custom groups plus the imported social-networking ones (Facebook, Twitter and Bebo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log and Favorite Contacts need no special introduction. You can add favorites by taping on the small star right next to the name.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer can be easily accessed via the dedicated key on the homescreen, while the fastest way to reach the Call log is the hardware green receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer shows a virtual phone keypad that lets you dial a number. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? the implementation on the GT540 Optimus searches both contact numbers and names unlike the one on the GW620, which went through only the contacts? numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the actual calls, voice quality is great: sound is crisp and loud enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the LG Optimus did well ? it scored a Good mark, so you won?t have trouble hearing it beep. You can find more about the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich messaging capabilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 Optimus can handle all common types of messages with ease - SMS, MMS and email. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of integration of that content as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail is one thing that you can't expect to have changed much compared to other Android handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted, spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Email app doesn?t display messages conversation style ? it sticks with the folder structure. The Inbox folder shows the number of messages that have been retrieved and how many of them are unread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts are also supported. You can have all your mail in the general inbox or choose to filter a specific account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two types of on-screen keyboard you get with the LG Optimus ? the phone dialpad and the on-screen QWERTY keyboard. By default you get the QWERTY regardless of the phone?s current orientation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery with 3D effects<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 Optimus has a pretty attractive gallery. 3D effects and smooth scrolling contribute to a pretty good user experience in general.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those 3D effects are reserved for Android 2.x devices only, but LG have somehow ported them to ver. 1.6 (even to 1.5 on the GW620).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual shortcut that allows you to share your images over email, MMS or Picasa is now updated to support social-networking and Bluetooth. Yes, there is Bluetooth sharing this time. Unfortunately, sharing multiple photos at a time isn?t available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 supports a couple of zoom methods ? you can use the onscreen virtual controls or you can zoom 2x with a simple double tap on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, zooming and panning is really fast.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>DivX/XviD/MP3 capable Media Player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Media Player does what it says on the tin ? and for the most part does it well. When you run the Media Player you must choose between Music and Video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Video section?s default view shows you the list of videos on the memory card. The player interface is simple and easy to use ? it offers the playback controls and automatically switches to full screen when you tilt the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great bonus (though hardly a surprise for an LG unit) is the built-in support for DivX and XviD videos. Playback is limited to maximum video resolution of WVGA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s better than usual ? built-in DivX/XviD support is rare on most OSes and Android is no exception. LG Optimus handled most XviD videos we threw at it reasonably well. The bigger ones (100MB+) had some dropped frames, but it wasn?t too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately playing DivX files is almost a no-go. None of our samples managed through the Media Player. It seems support is limited to WQVGA resolution and specific bitrate, but we couldn?t hit the right format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music in the Media Player app is skinned to resemble other LG music players, but aside from a sleeker look and a few animated transitions, it doesn?t really bring anything new to the table.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no equalizers, no visualizations ? nothing the vanilla player doesn?t have and nothing to really excite the audiophiles out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Android Music app is here<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Selecting Music on the main menu launches the default Android music player. Again, it?s an odd choice considering they?ve taken the time to add a skinned Media player. Anyway, the functionality (the lack of it mostly) is the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The core features are all there and the looks are mostly fine but there is still some catching up to do before the best in class are matched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort tracks by artist or album or you can browse them by playlists. The now playing user interface - though very sleek and more comfortable - doesn't offer too many new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While a song is playing, the track info is visible in the notification area on the homescreen and that?s a handy shortcut to the actual music player app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the well known letdowns are still there, like no equalizer presets and no alternative visualizations when album art isn?t available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part is the option to run relevant Google and YouTube searches.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 Optimus is equipped with an FM radio too. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 48 stations as favorites. You can also listen on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not quite surprisingly the LG GT540 Optimus audio quality is pretty close to the one of the LG GW620. Both handsets are pretty quiet but have nice clean audio output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cut-off extreme bass frequencies are probably our only (not quite significant) grudge against it with the rest of the readings being very good (distortion levels) to excellent (stereo crosstalk, noise levels and dynamic range).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera is no big deal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 Optimus is equipped with a 3-megapixel auto-focus camera and has no flash whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is an almost exact copy of the camera interface on the LG Viewty Smart, for a random reference. That has its good and bad points. For one, first-gen Androids are known for their rather bare camera interfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus camera interface is still pretty simple but finds room for some of the essential functions right on the screen. Selecting the auto-focus mode, the flash mode and exposure compensation is matter of a single tap. The controls on the left can be hidden to free up space in the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between still camera and camcorder is done with the trademark virtual slider we've seen on previous LG phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here comes the not-so-good part: the extended settings menu. It uses the well-known rotating dial and its problem is that it's quite slow. You can access only one item at a time, to get to the others you need to rotate the dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't skip over items - you need to rotate over all of them till you get to the one you need, and the dial can be unresponsive at times. Using a simple list - while not as pretty - would have been much faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Usually, only the rarely used settings go into the extended settings menu, but in the LG GT540 Optimus things like shoot mode and scene mode are buried in there. And scene mode was supposed to be a quick way to set up the camera for a particular kind of shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shooting experience on the other hand is fine. The camera manages to focus and snap a shot quickly enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the image quality, there are four forces at play here that give their best to mess it up. First is the noisy image sensor, then comes the aggressive noise reduction that smears everything; and finally the heavy JPEG compression that results in a lot of compression artifacts. On top of that, oversharpening is quite prominent too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the LG GT540. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 camcoder is a mediocre performer. It manages VGA videos at 17 frames per second, which doesn't sound particularly exciting. Videos lack detail and there are some artifacts to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is almost identical to the still camera?s. The same criticisms we leveled at the still camera UI apply here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an LG GT540 camera video sample.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 offers the full connectivity package. It covers the basics with quad-band GSM/EDGE but also offers speedy 3G connectivity with 7.2Mbps HSDPA and HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For local connectivity, there's Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.1 (just the headset profile though, you can't send or receive files unless you pay the Android Market a visit and get the free Bluetooth File Transfer app). The GT540 features a built-in GPS receiver with A-GPS support, microUSB and a hot swappable microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a 3.5mm audio jack so you can plug in your favorite set of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Control widget comes in handy when you need to quickly turn Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or the GPS receiver on or off. An Airplane mode switch would have been a great addition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing your data couldn't be easier - it's just that you mainly sync with the Google services. For those of you who prefer desktop syncing with Outlook or Outlook Express, the Moxier Sync app comes in handy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good but Flash-less web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Great web browsing has been an undoubted Android strength since day one. The LG GT540 is hardly an exception here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty minimalist. You get the address bar, which is docked at the top of you screen so scrolling down and hiding it isn't an option and a small arrow at the right side of the screen. Tapping this arrow reveals the LG custom interface for the browser, which is actually a bar with six shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those let you reload a page, go back and forward, access your bookmarks, open a new tab or check the browser settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hitting the menu key reveals six more shortcuts. You can start typing an address, search and select text, check out your downloads or exit the web browser from here. The final button reveals even more options (bookmarks, window overview, settings etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you don't get double-tap or one-finger zooming on the GT540. And since pinch-zooming isn't even an option, you only get to use the on-screen controls for that purpose. There is no text reflow either so LG's second Android handset is a rather poor performer in terms of zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no Flash support on the LG GT540. Neither Flash games nor Flash videos are an option. You do get to watch YouTube but it uses the preinstalled YouTube application rather than the web browser itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer seems fine, office document reader preloaded<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 comes with the usual set of organizing apps. We are starting to see a positive trend among recent Android-running handsets to have a document viewer preinstalled, rather than making the user download one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is Quickoffice and it supports viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and PDF but only their Office 2003 versions. This time you don't need a dedicated PDF reader but you still have to get the paid app for editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can't download them to the phone's internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a voice recorder, which might be pretty useful for making audio notes and a nicely touch-optimized calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, clicking the SNS icon in the main menu gives you an app designed to help you update your Facebook, Twitter and Bebo profiles. You can also keep track of your friends' activities in this app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google maps and GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT540 comes with a built-in GPS receiver. It got satellite lock in a minute and a half even without the A-GPS on, which is a decent achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and of course makes an appearance on the LG Optimus as well. Its voice-guided navigation version, the Google Maps Navigation is only available in the US and in the UK, the rest of the world is in no luck here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still plan a route and track your current location so it is better than nothing but you have to rely on network data for downloading the map info. To zoom in and out in Google Maps you have to use well-known on-screen controls. Luckily, you can also double-tap on a selected area to zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street View mode is supported and it's probably the most fun part of Google Maps - it gives you a 360-degree view of the surroundings where it's available. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like you're taking a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn't a dedicated sat-nav application, so if you need that, you will have to visit the Android market and pick one yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market gives you loads of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Market structure is quite simple - featured apps on top and, below them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the Market shows several featured apps. The Market organizes apps and games into two separate tabs and each tab lists sub-categories (e.g. Finance applications, Arcade &amp; Action games). In each category you can select to view the Top free apps or ones that are ?Just in?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a third tab ? Downloads ? that keeps track of what you?ve already downloaded. Do keep an eye on this tab ? when updates become available for an app you?ve installed, a label shows up next to the app name to notify you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, we?re talking the makers of Black Label handsets and some pretty good cameraphones. And well, it?s only their second attempt at Android. No wonder then, they?re not too keen to make a big noise about it. On a second thought though, it?s really the Android way. The quiet multitaskers will just do their job and offer consumer-friendly smartphone experience. Quite often it would be first-time smartphone users too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a casual look, possibly the biggest sin of the GT540 is the outdated Android version. While the competition is busy releasing Éclair-powered devices (v2.1), the GT540 owners will have to wait for an upgrade, which is not certain at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting a Donut instead of an Eclair is not such a huge letdown after all. There?re enough applications out there that will run comfortably on Android v1.6. And by the way, the Optimus does get you v1.6, as opposed to the GW620 that only comes with the obsolete v1.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most importantly, the potential LG GT540 users are quite unlikely to worry about such things. The Optimus is supposed to be the first smartphone they ever had. And it?s clearly got what it takes to entice feature phone users to upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GT540 Optimus boasts HSDPA and Wi-Fi for a full connectivity set. Bluetooth is crippled indeed by the Donut, but still. It?s a HVGA touchscreen while some of its direct rivals come with a QVGA display. The phone is social-network-friendly and has more than decent media. And as far as its design is concerned, the GT540 seems to know how to please everyone ? there are multiple color versions and distinct stylings to suite every taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG position the Optimus as an entry level smartphone and we think the device will connect with LG users who would like to upgrade. As to competition, Android?s been busy lately and there?s plenty of choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first name that comes to mind is the Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica. It has a larger screen, serves Éclairs and thinks as fast as the Optimus. However, its price tag is a bit higher. Among the other Droids worth considering is the Motorola QUENCH. It packs a capacitive display, a 5-megapixel snapper along with a highly customized UI, the MOTOBLUR. It?s Android v1.5 underneath though. The cheaper HTC Tattoo has a QVGA screen that shortens the list of compatible applications. Another option is the HTC Magic (a.k.a. T-Mobile myTouch 3G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung I5700 Galaxy Spica ? Motorola QUENCH ? HTC Tattoo ? HTC Magic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Android is not set in stone, the list of competitors gets even longer. Here come the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic and its even cheaper versions ? the 5230 and the 5530 XpressMusic. All three of them are based on the S60 platform and have been around long enough to now cost way less than the LG GT540 and the rest of the potential rivals. You might want to check out the HTC Touch2 PocketPC as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 5800 XpressMusic ? Nokia 5230 ? Nokia 5530 XpressMusic ? HTC Touch2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, the LG GT540 is standard issue entry-level Android phone. Nothing more, nothing less. And this seems just right for the intended target audience. The various paint jobs with fashionable styling suggest the Optimus is getting ready to be enjoyed by girls and boys alike. It is smart and has rich connectivity and social networking features. There are some flaws we couldn?t just let go but none of them is a real deal breaker. There you go.</paragraph>
