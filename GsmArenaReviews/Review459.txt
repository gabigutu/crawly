			<paragraph>Nokia 6030 is a cheap phone, which looks good and offers a radio. Having designed such a phone, the manufacture is trying to repeat the commercial success of its older low-middle class phones, which have recently been petering out. Is the new 6030 model prepared to follow the path outlined by Nokia's legendary models?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia presented its 6030 model as an entry into the low middle class category in March, just before the CeBIT fair. The main advantage of this phone is its design and price. What it will not bewilder customers with is its functions, for which an explanation is also at hand - Nokia 6030 is directed at the group of less-pretentious users, who are expected to get satisfaction of a common basic functional menu.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The low middle class phones are very important for manufacturers, even though it does not seem so at first sight. Parents have already become used to equipping their children with mobiles at a relatively young age, so any simple control together with a reasonable price is equal to a boom. Common mobile phone users form the other group that will surely appreciate these same features. There is no need of megapixels here and memory cards appear to be unnecessary.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Glossy strips<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone gives a solid impression. The famous standard mobile construction has round edges, a size of 104 × 44 × 18 mm and weighs 90 grams. Glossy strips are dragged along all side parts of the phone. Although plastic, they successfully imitate metal. What's more, they visually divide the side parts of the mobile, astringing this way the strip of different color among them. Thanks to this effect, the phone looks far thinner than it really is. At the bottom edges of the device are situated the eyelets for interlacing a strap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the front cover of the new phone, it does not resemble any other Nokia model's front side. It looks as if it has been transversely laminated with 5 different big strips, 2 of which constitute of the really bulky context keys. The very first element that catches the eye of the new owner is surely the main control button. It is glossy - just like the strips on the sideways. However, as its surface is visually quite big, a single look is enough to reveal the cheap image of the plastic control button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer's logo glasses just below the silver strip of the speaker as well as on the back cover of the phone. There is no sense looking for a camera lens here, for Nokia 6030 does not take pictures. This, however, may be a very smart idea in terms of the target user category, because simplicity keeps the price low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Glossy silver elements are literally everywhere </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two camps of plastics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Remarkable is the elaboration of the upper part of the cover, which consists of one piece only. It does not break in two at the cap, in result of which the construction of the phone seems solid enough. Unfortunately, it just seems this way. At the very beginning of the tests I felt like praising 6030 for its high quality construction, but after some time the back cover (which otherwise has a safe opening mechanism) started to show a play. The latter is far from strong, but becomes notable when the keypad is in use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Back cover is made of good quality plastics, but unfortunately, it does not hold tight ? battery and the SIM bedding </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The surface elaboration is not worthy praising. Well, at least it is not in the case of the black color version of the phone, which we are processing the tests on. The front cover is made of glossy material, so fingerprints are visible everywhere. As a result, the cover gets almost immediately sticky and dirty. Far much better is the situation with the matt plastic plates, of which the back cover of the phone is made. What a pity they were not applied along the whole body of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Comparison to a credit card ? Nokia 6030 in my hand </paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is at most probable that when you pick your Nokia 6030, people around you will hardly notice that the phone in your hand is a low middle class one. Nokia 6030 could be easily mistaken for Nokia's manager model, which does not have a camera, especially when being looked at from behind. That is why this phone allows for a quite a pleasant show off at a relatively low price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   "Metal" strips on the side parts of the phone tack on it an element of luxury </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6030 will be available in three official color versions: the tested black one, a golden "champagne" one, which we did not happen to like that much, and a silver one, which looks great and thus might be the best option among all three. A strong asset of the silver version is also the absence of finger "pitter-patters" on its surface. Nokia has also designed removable covers for the 6030 model.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Passive means slow<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this holds true for the 6030 display. It has been manufactured with CSTN technology. In terms of quality, the display fits into the middle class category. Yet, although passive, the display is quite easy to read under direct sunlight. It is able to show 65K colors, having 128×128 pixels on a square of 27 mm sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, the plastic plate of the display is even. The convex "glass", that is sometimes used instead, often makes things worse.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keys are huge<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad is watery. Although the main four-way control button moves in a sure and pleasant way, it waggles too much. The most impeding part of the whole phone, however, turned to be the confirming joystick. It sticks out a lot over the main control button, which results into the user brushing against it much more often than they might be happy to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Keys are made of glossy plastics ? joystick sticks out a lot</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placed around the control button are the context keys and the standard keys for accepting or denying a call. All four fields are really large and are therefore very easy to press. They feature low uplift and excellent reactions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric keypad is relatively good. It allows for comfortable writing, with all keys being effortlessly reached by one's thumb. When pressed, instead of sharp clicks it gives out pleasant muffle sound. Although the backlighting of the keypad is even, it is relatively weak. Some residual backlighting works under the confirming joystick, too, and helps you take bearings in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Keypad backlighting is insufficient ? the phone in twilight</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well known menu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of the menu is a copy of the menus of all other current Nokia phones of the Series 40. You can either pick up items and organize them into a matrix, or use the model of a long list with individual icons. The menu search is possible due to the four-way control button and the cursed on confirming joystick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most serious minuses of the display is its inability to change the font color. This disadvantage becomes especially obvious on dark wallpapers, where texts are almost, if not completely impossible to read. A perfect example of the mentioned color problem of the display is the following picture of underwater world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      View setup of the main display and the main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left context key has been assigned the "Go to" function. Its menu contains all important items, which are possible to organize. The right functional button as well as all four ways of the main control button can be assigned one selected menu function.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6030 uses simultaneously both the phonebook, which is saved on the SIM card, and the entries in the phone's memory. The memory takes in up to 300 names. It is not much, but on the other side, this is an amount, of the whole of which the target customer of 6030 will hardly ever make use of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The phonebook ? types of numbers ? contact details ? searching </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each name can be assigned 5 different phone numbers, an email, a web address, a street address and a note. Individual contacts cannot be given neither a picture, nor a ringing melody. This disadvantage could possibly be made up for by filing the contacts into groups, which can be subsequently differentiated by using different melodies. This is however an emergency and inconvenient approach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Contact groups list ? only groups can be assigned different melodies and thus get demarked </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone does not have call filters. Even though you are offered earphones with a microphone, you will not be able to dial a number by using your voice. Searching is based on consecutive entering of the relevant characters. As for the phone call itself, one can listen to it in the speaker using the loud handsfree. The latter may be good quality and loud enough for the owners of Nokia 6030, but as far as the opposite speaker is involved, there is no doubt he/she will complain about the weak factuality and the noise.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sound and text<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Ringing is polyphonic and features 16 voices. There are nearly 30 melodies prepared for you in the phone. Provided you need more, additional melodies can be downloaded and saved into the shared memory of 3 MB capacity. A bit weird are the cracks that can be heard at the very beginning of each sound step, played in the Gallery. Luckily those cracks did not reappear in the ringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for ringing profiles, they allow for modifications. What's more, Nokia offers two places for the user to create a completely new profile of their own. The device also offers time profiles with preset time out options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Profiles ? time profile setup </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6030 manages text and MMS messages. In the process of writing it informs you about the number of the free characters left. A text messages can be divided into 6 sub-messages. Available is also a standard T9 dictionary, which is possible to completely switch off. Multimedia messages can use up as much as 100 kB at most. There is no email client in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Message types ? T9 dictionary is possible to switch off completely ? writing with small letters ? a capital letters </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Alarm and calendar<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock can be set to ring repetitively, in a selected interval. It also enables for choosing the days, on which it shall be active. The calendar is once again incomplete. Its menu offers a month view only, which is extremely insufficient. At the same time, this is the function, in which the focus on non-pretentious users should have stepped back into background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Alarm clock is repeated ? selecting repetition days ? sleep fill settings One can choose the day, which the calendar week should start with. Each day can be assigned an event, a note as long as maximum 160 characters, and a reminder, which can be repeated daily, every week, every fortnight, once a month or even once a year. The calendar does not have a task manager. Month view at the calendar ? note view </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Do not look for a stopwatch, a countdown, a dictaphone or a mail box in Nokia 6030. The phone only has a standard calculator and a simple currency converter. A bit more complicated converter is installed into the Applications. It offers distances, capacity, surface, temperature and other conversions, incl. a conversion type of its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Application converter </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mono FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Those, who may be thinking of buying the new Finnish toy, may start feel undecided by the FM receiver present in the phone. I really don't know, whether Nokia would have suffered losses, if it had implemented a stereophonic radio. To activate the radio, you need to plug Nokia's HS-7 earphones, delivered together with the mobile. Surprisingly, they play pretty well for the cheap phone they have been attached to. Do not expect any audiophile parties, though. What we are offered here is just another pair of common plastic earphones. Anyway, even so, the bass components and the drum beats can be heard clearly, which is - as you all know - far from a common feature of mobiles' basic equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Earphones HS-7 delivered together with the phone ? slide clip ? there is no radio without plugging the earphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone allows you to save as much as 12 radio stations, including their titles. Automatic tuning is sure enough. The earphones can also be used as a handsfree set. At the point of "confluence" of their wires there is a tiny base with a microphone as well as a button for both accepting and denying a call. Moreover, the mains leading to the converters have different lengths. As a result, you can drop the wire of the right earphone around your neck, so that the earphones alone can lie on your breast, when not used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Tuning stations in the monophonic radio </paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No Mini-USB connection<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In order to connect the mobile to a computer or to another device, you will have to use a data cable. Other options are not available. The main difficulty is that Nokia 6030 is not equipped with Bluetooth, nor has it infrared port. What's more, the delivery package does not contain a data cable, so you will have to buy it in addition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the 6030 model was first launched, there was a lot of speculating about whether the connector, which could be seen on the presented pictures, was of the mini-USB type. Well, I will have to disappoint you, for it is not. What we have here is an interface of Nokia's own, which the Finns called "Plug and Play". I do not understand, where the standard Pop-Port disappeared, since it was virtually identical as far as usage was concerned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The slot for the Plug and Play connector</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with a built-in hardware modem, which you will, however, hardly have the chance to make use of. The obstacle lies in the necessity of cable connection, which is also the only one available, as well as in the lower speed of the GPRS technology - in this phone of Class 6 only. Web fans will have to do with the 2.0 version of the WAP browser, which also handles simple internet pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Internet browser </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let's conquer the world!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main advantage of the new Nokia is probably the design. In terms of functional equipment we can hardly speak of any miracles, especially considering the fact, that the phone lacks certain basic functions, such as the week and the day view in the calendar, the use of ringing melodies for distinguishing the callers or stereophony of the built-in radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I dare predict that Nokia 6030 is going to be a successful mobile phone, which many mobile users will probable get to like. Yet, I seriously doubt the success of this phone will be as impressive as the one of the legendary Nokia 3510i or Nokia 3100, which achieved some excellent commercial results at the time. Besides, it may be worth considering the option of paying somewhat 30 euros more and getting rather the 6021 model, which offers an active TFT display, Bluetooth and a better organized calendar.</paragraph>
