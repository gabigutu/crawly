			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The latest midrange offering from Samsung features the ever familiar Andr...wait-what you mean, it's not Android? But it looks exactly like Android! Well, it seems things just took a more interesting turn. The Samsung S5380 Wave Y runs the latest version of the Bada OS, 2.0. Like us, you may be used to Samsung being almost synonymous with Google's mobile OS these days.But they're obviously still pushing their in-house platform on the Wave lineup, in case, you know, Android spontaneously combusts or something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not be too brash-options are a good thing, and having one more smartphone platform to choose from can't hurt. Bada 2.0 has had several revisions since its initial release with the Samsung Galaxy Wave 3, and the latest stable build runs great on the comparatively limited Wave Y hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is the complete feature list, as well as the potential deal-breakers:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For people coming from Android, the limited supply in Samsung's app store will be a major question mark. But the Bada app store has been slowly building up content. And to be honest, the likely Wave Y buyers are not coming from another smartphone. Samsung's Y models are targeting the young and the Wave Y will most probably compete with the Galaxy Y for the favor of the brand's loyal users looking to replace a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While obviously not as impressive as the Bada 2.0 flagship, the Wave 3, the Wave Y provides a good amount of extras which do not push the price too high. That's good news if you're shopping on a budget. The next page features our usual hardware tour.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Wave Y gives us a 2 GB treat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5380 Wave Y comes in a small box with a microUSB charger, a microUSB data cable and as well as a quick start guide. To complement the rather limited 150 MB of internal storage, Samsung have included a 2 GB microSD card, complete with an adapter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S5380 Wave Y 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5380 Wave Y measures 110 x 58.5 x 12.3mm. In terms of dimensions, it is very similar to the Samsung S7250 Wave M, although the slightly smaller screen allows the Wave Y to maintain a more compact form, and shave off almost 20g of weight, coming in a tad over 100g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5380 Wave Y's all-plastic body is solid and feels good, weight-wise. The capacitive screen doesn't dominate the front like on most higher-end Samsung smartphones, and it doesn't have that oversized look when compared to the frame. The back panel features a stylized groove which gives the appearance of a partially removable back panel area, but in reality the entire back part of the phone is revealed when it is removed. We'll take it apart further down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display unit is nothing to write home about, but does an adequate job at displaying content with a decent ~180 ppi pixel density. Its reflectiveness can have a moderately adverse effect on how visible the screen elements are in sunlight, and the screen surface is slightly prone to fingerprints and smudges, but not overly so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is our display test for the Wave Y:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the Wave 3, the Wave Y uses capacitive call keys around the physical Home key. They're not backlit when idle and the single massive Home key is a prominent accent on the otherwise sparse front. The bad thing we noicted is the backlighting of the capacitive controls is somewhat hazy, and worse yet, they're not haptic enabled. In fact, haptic feedback isn't available for the touchscreen either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display and logo is the earpiece and a barely-visible proximity sensor. There's no ambient light detector and no automatic brightness setting for the Wave Y's screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung S5380 Wave Y features the volume rocker, which has comfortable thickness and is easy to locate by touch and press. There is also a lanyard eyelet, as well as a small crevice for prying off the back panel. The Lock key on the right is smaller and more flush to the side of the phone, which can make hitting it with accuracy a bit tricky. There's no dedicated camera key on either side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the device features the 3.5mm audio jack resting on a fixed surface that's not part of the back panel. Conversely, the bottom area has an opening cut for access to the microUSB port. This is also where the microphone hole is located.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back, the only interesting parts are concentrated near the top, where the 2MP camera lies next to the speaker grille. There is no LED flash to speak of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens is sufficiently recessed into the body of the phone, which keeps it out of the way of scratches and fingerprints. The loudspeaker on the other hand only has a small nub, which doesn't help against the sound getting muffled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back features a standard plastic rear panel, which gives access to the battery, SIM and microSD compartments. As stated above, the groove along the back panel is entirely aesthetic, only gives the appearance of a dedicated lower area of the phone. By using the small crevice on the left side of the phone, the entire back and bottom cover of the phone comes off. The panel itself is made of a very flexible, almost rubber-like plastic, which nevertheless fits tightly against the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath, the 1200mAh battery provides 6 hours and 40 minutes of talk time, and up to 570 hours of standby. As usual, the SIM card is accessed by removing the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD slot is also located under the back panel, which eliminates some of the convenience of having a hot-swappable port in the first place. After all having to remove the back panel is not too many steps away from having to take out the battery. Nonetheless, a hot-swappable microSD port is one of the few advantages the Wave Y has over some of the higher-end phones in the Wave lineup, like the Wave I, II, and 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5380 Wave Y is a solid phone for its price. It has good construction and decent functionality, while retaining compact measurements and an acceptable weight. If compactness is your thing, the Wave Y looks good and feels right in hand, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next is our tour of the Bada 2.0 OS complete with benchmarks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Bada OS 2 with TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've established that the Wave Y is not an Android phone, despite the visual similarities, which are prevalent thanks to Samsung's TouchWiz UI. The Bada/TouchWiz combo was, in a way, being worked on by Samsung long before the appearance of Android, and the Koreans have learned a lot from their experience with Google's mobile OS. The 2.0 OS is optimized to run software seamlessly and efficiently on high end phones like the Wave 3, as well as lower-end models like our Wave Y.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada 2.0 brought a new element to the homescreen - the Live Panel, essentially an extra vertically scrollable pane of full-sized widgets. There are contextual menus just like on Android, and the gallery, media players and the web browser match those found on Android, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some basic weather info has been added to the lockscreen, although it's not a dynamic weather widget, and all you get is a simple temperature reading and a current weather icon. In case of a missed event, swiping on the notification will perform the relevant action. If the music player is running, you'll get the music widget at the top of the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen can stretch over as many as ten panes to fill with widgets and shortcuts. There's a scrollable homescreen pane, called Live Panel. It comes with full-size widgets such as AccuWeather, Yahoo Finance, AP mobile, calendar and search. You can choose their ordering and enable or disable them as you please, but you cannot remove them altogether or add new ones. The bottom of the Live Panel is reserved for contact shortcuts. You can place as many favourite contact pictures there as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single hardware control on the Wave Y (the Home key) switches between the regular homescreen and the Live Panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen panes can also readily accommodate application shortcuts alongside widgets downloadable from the Samsung app market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on any homescreen allows you to edit the contents of that specific pane, while a pinch zoom displays an aggregate view of all panes currently in use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is almost the same as on Android, with the big difference being that you cannot pull it down bit by bit - it's a tap to expand, a tap to collapse. There are switches for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, sound and auto rotation. Music controls are displayed too if the player is running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada 2.0 is a proper multitasking platform, so naturally, you get that on the Wave Y. The task manager is accessed by a long press on the Home button so you can easily switch between currently active applications, or terminate them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is flat, with all available items and apps initially spreading across two screens of icons. If needed, you can add up to 7 more. Icons align in a 4 x 4 grid and you can reposition them the way you like. Scrolling the menu screens is looped, so when you reach the last pane you don't have to sweep all the way back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned earlier, the Bada OS is heavily indebted to Android. That being said, there are some important differences to note. The Samsung S5380 Wave Y has a single hardwired control. A Menu key is the first thing experienced Android users are likely to miss. One thing directly resulting from this absence is the fact that all application-specific settings are packed together in the general settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, if you're adding a contact for example, you won't be able to access the phonebook settings. You'll have to go back to the main menu and access the settings from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the absence of Menu and Back buttons, the previous Bada edition relied heavily on on-screen soft keys. We like it how the new version pretty much gets rid of them. The swipe gestures in the phonebook and inbox are nothing new but they did well to keep them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fully-functional phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wave Y's phonebook has rich functionality and practically unlimited capacity. The handset displays the phone memory and SIM-stored contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you really can have all of your contacts gathered in one place. If you want to use your Exchange contacts too, you not only need to set up your Exchange account properly, but you need to import them in the Contacts settings. It's a very easy step, but it took us a while to realize why our Google contacts were not available in the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search the entries by either kinetic scrolling or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen. There's a Search bar at the top of the contact list too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields available for each contact, which doesn't prevent them from remaining perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada OS has a cool phonebook feature, which is also available in TouchWiz-skinned Androids. A right swipe over a name in the contact list will dial the contact's default number while a left swipe will start the Message composer. In Bada 2.0, in whatever direction you swipe, you'll reveal four shortcut keys: Call, New Message, Video Call and Delete. The side-sweeps also works in other lists where you have names or numbers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5380 Wave Y excelled in our reception tests, with trouble-free handling of calls, no choppy audio or reception issues. Unfortunately, there is no secondary microphone for active noise cancellation here. And no smart dial either. The Wave Y will only recognize digits and suggest corresponding numbers from the phonebook, but it won't suggest names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include muting, using the keypad, holding the call or adding another call to this conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the S5380 Wave Y. It snatched a Below Average score. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wave Y supports SMS, MMS, and email. Texts and multimedia messages share the same editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging app resembles its corresponding counterpart in Android and iOS. It only offers Conversation view, but in the Advanced tab you can create folders to archive your messages and filter spam and system messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - reveal a menu with shortcuts for Call, Video Call, Block Number or Delete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to email, setting up your account on the Wave Y is hassle-free. You just need to go to the Accounts section in the Main Settings and set up whatever emails you need - Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, Exchange or other. In most cases, you'll just need to enter your username and password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have to set your email account up manually, there is a host of settings that you can tweak. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported and you can set the handset to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting in roaming. The email client supports SSL encryption too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client looks pretty much like the Android app. It supports conversations and in the upper left corner you can switch to the advanced folder view. Multiple accounts are supported and there is a shared inbox for all your emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on an email message will once again reveal a hidden menu with options for Download/Reply, Forwarding, Block or Delete.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich input options, Siri-like voice commands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Capacitive touchscreens usually won't give you handwriting recognition but, just like the Wave 3, the S5380 Wave Y is among the few exceptions. The handwriting screen has two viewing modes - full screen or a dedicated handwriting box (usually taking about half of your screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer typing to drawing, go for the on-screen keyboards. You get diverse options - a portrait numpad and a landscape full-QWERTY keyboard with or without the T9 Trace enabled. The so-called Continuous input is similar to the popular Swype. You tap on the screen and move from letter to letter without lifting the finger. Just like Swype, the Continuous input guesses the word you're trying to write (even if you weren't that accurate) and places suggestions in the text above the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That should allow you to write up to 40 words per minute. Now that's fast typing! Plus, if you prefer the old way of typing letter-by-letter, it's still available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave Y supports voice dictation and voice commands very similar to the iPhone 4S's Siri. The major difference is your Wave Y can't actually speak.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the voice dictation works just like on the iPhone 4S - you tap on the Mic key on your virtual keyboard and speak. Then your Wave Y will put everything down for you. The service is powered by Vlingo and is not as smooth as Siri, but most of the time it works just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you double tap on the Home key you'll get to the Voice Commands interface. You can do things Siri-style, but the software isn't that smart. For example to compose a message you speak out the relevant command and the name of the addressee. After you've said the name though, you must say something like Message or Tell for the software to know where the actual text of the message starts. If you want proper punctuation, you'll have to specifically dictate all the commas and question marks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice commands can be used for voice dialling, text messages, emails, web searches, memos, playing songs or playlists, and social updates (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). You can't create appointments and alarms, and no - you will not get replies to the questions you ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are voice alerts too for things like incoming messages and status updates, and your phone can also read messages out loud. You can download different voices for free at the Samsung Apps store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Credit goes to Samsung for trying to expand the voice recognition capabilities of the Bada OS, even if it isn't the next Siri.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Android-ish gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another thing that got redesigned under Bada 2.0 is the gallery, which - to no one's surprise - takes after Android. It's fluid and efficient, and prettier than in previous versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports kinetic scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zooming is also available but you can also double tap on the screen to zoom in and out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave Y gallery shows the pictures in full resolution unlike most Android handsets, so zooming in on a picture will reveal much greater detail. Like the Android galleries, the Wave Y offers rotate and crop tools too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Functional video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the video player is quite simple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave Y supports MP4/H.264/MKV files, but it does not include support for AVI files, regardless of format. Subtitles were not recognized either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The capable music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like the gallery, the Bada 2.0 music player is designed to look like the one in TouchWiz-skinned droids. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface looks even better when you use the music player in landscape mode. Browsing albums or tracks is pretty standard in portrait mode: you get a list of all songs or albums, each with a small thumb. The list is smoothly scrollable with impressive kinetic effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're browsing in landscape mode you'll be getting an album art reel of virtual CDs. Tapping on a CD will expand it to show all the tracks within the selected album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, sweeping down across the screen (from the arrow above the central CD) will display a virtual dial to let you search the albums or tracks alphabetically.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5380 Wave Y is equipped with an FM radio with RDS. You can navigate to different stations by dragging across the dial on the top, or using the arrow keys below. You can also save up to 8 radio station presets. The interface is slightly different than the one found on the Wave 3, mostly due to the fact that it does not feature FM audio recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also listen to the FM radio on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed to serve as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good audio quality somewhat spoilt by stereo crosstalk<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Wave Y S5380 did fairly well in our audio quality test. It's not the best we have seen, but it certainly does better than its price tag suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an external amplifier, the smartphone got impressive scores all over the field, with the average volume levels the only thing that could possibly be improved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones are connected, there is plenty of degradation in terms of stereo crosstalk. It gets pretty high, but that's about the only score to take a notable hit, so it's not too bad overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The 2 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5380 Wave Y is capable of taking 2 megapixel photos and capturing QVGA video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera viewfinder is quite reminiscent of the company's recent cameraphones. The comfortable interface is nicely touch-optimized and has all you need on the two vertical bars on each side of the viewfinder, and there is an option to hide them both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the important settings are user-configurable: white balance, brightness, default storage, geotagging, exposure metering, etc. You can switch the default storage between the main memory and the microSD card. Unlike the more expensive 5 MP camera on the Wave 3, the camera found here does not feature touch or autofocus, and is instead fixed focus. As such, we do not recommend this phone if you plan on shooting photos close range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5380 Wave Y produces images that are decent, although not spectacular. The camera features colors with good accuracy, although the sharpness of the image left much to be desired-again, most likely a result of the lack of autofocus. The noise level we saw on these phones was OK, but the tonal contrast not so much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Here are some camera samples:<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unimpressive video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface has very few visible options, namely recording length, brightness, and resolution. The advanced settings allow you to additionally adjust white balance, effects and default storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Wave Y captures video at QVGA (320 x 240)@15fps. The resolved detail is very low by today's standards, but given the price of the phone, it makes sense that Samsung had to skimp on something. If you can get past the low resolution and framerate, the color balance and contrast are otherwise good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample from the Samsung Wave Y.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is more complete with NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All kinds of network connectivity are at the users' disposal - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSPA. The GSM/EDGE networking of course comes in quad-band flavor and there's dual-band 3G - 900/2100MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5380 Wave Y supports Bluetooth 3.0. Naturally, A2DP is part of the deal. To activate Bluetooth (and Wi-Fi), you can use the dedicated control hidden in the notification area at the top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some apps like the Samsung Store, Facebook or Twitter require a configured packet data profile and an active SIM card to use Wi-Fi connectivity. Still those services don't actually use packet data instead of Wi-Fi, they just check if it's available. Strange, indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of Wi-Fi connectivity, the Wave Y supports 802.11 b/g/n connectivity as well as Wi-Fi Direct. Thanks to the latter, you are able to exchange files with other Wi-Fi Direct-capable gadgets and without a Wi-Fi router. It works just like Bluetooth transfers usually do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5380 Wave Y is DLNA-capable device. You can use the AllShare app to connect with other DLNA-enabled devices to share music, picture and video content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave Y also has NFC support, so you can check out any of the rather scarce NFC tags lying around if you encounter any in your travels. If you have another NFC enabled device, such as a Bluetooth headset or Wi-Fi router, the Wave Y should connect to them quickly without requiring additional setup. You can also create your own NFC tags. The Wave Y allows you to assign various information to them, including bookmarks, contacts, memos, phone profiles, All-Share profiles, as well as the aforementioned Bluetooth or Wi-Fi profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S5380 Wave Y also packs a standard microUSB port. You can choose from 4 connection modes - Modem, Mass storage, Samsung Kies and USB debugging. Samsung Kies is used to connect your Samsung mobile phone to a computer. In Mass Storage mode the phone mounts its internal memory (1GB user-accessible) and the inserted memory card as removable drives on your computer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dolphin is your web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S5380 Wave Y packs the latest version Webkit-based Samsung Dolphin Browser, which resembles the one found on Android. Yes, we know we said that before. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the refresh button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in or pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom in/out or use double tap. There is kinetic scrolling too. Text reflow is not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bada 2.0 offers Flash Lite support and some of the banners showed up, although we couldn't get embedded videos to play. The Dolphin browser also offers a download manager and a search-on-page option. If you tap and hold on a chunk of text you'll get the usual selection tools, along with copy and translate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wave Y comes with its own Calendar app, which offers three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also add locations, participants and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave Y features a decent alarm clock application, which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern. It also hosts the world clock, stop-watch and timer functions. There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have included the My Files app - a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo, Tasks and Voice Recorder are self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social Hub is the messaging and media sharing service - this one app allows you to create a message (it may pack media content too) and then send it to various services - SMS/MMS, email, social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Search, which can be added as a widget in your Live Panel, works on everything in your phone - contacts, images, music, videos, emails, history, apps, etc. It works very well and helps when you have lots of content. It also offers internet search with Google or Bing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Apps gets you more apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Bada OS offers a native application repository from the start - Samsung Apps. Samsung Apps is very similar to the Android Market. It has three tabs - featured, top and category view. There is also a download section and search option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Apps store is expanding fast, although we can't say the same about its quality. Still, there are thousands of apps inside, so you'll probably find at least a few useful tools and fun games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Samsung App store's growth is impressive, it is far behind Apple's App Store, Google's Android Market or even the Windows Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a music store called Music Hub. Its functionality is pretty much the same as the iTunes store - you can use it to buy single tracks or entire albums.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It seems the Bada OS is pushed to the sidelines, what with Android and iOS combining for almost half of the devices sold last year. What's interesting is that Samsung themselves have accounted for a large portion of those Android sales. Does this mean that they are going to go full-fledged with Android in the future, putting Bada to rest at some point? Only time will tell. What it does mean is that for the time being Samsung are hedging their bets by keeping Bada in play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And they're making it fit for all budgets in a bid to secure wide backing for their homegrown OS. The impressive S8600 Wave 3 is of course their top-shelf offering, which we'd gladly recommend, if money is of no object.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a screen which rivals most high-end smartphones, as well as a better processor, internal memory, and a 5MP camera capable of 720p video. The media playback functionality is also far superior. Granted, all of this comes at more than double the cost of the Wave Y.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a better camera and bigger screen are what you're looking for, but only just, then the Wave M offers a 3.6 inch screen (albeit at the same resolution), a 5MP camera, as well as a secondary front-facing camera for video conferencing, for about ?60 more.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>That being said, it's hard to not consider an Android phone. The Android marketplace continues to grow, and the operating system provides many advantages simply not found on Bada's proprietary OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5360 Galaxy Y comes with Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread out of box, and features virtually identical specifications to the Wave Y, with the exception of a slightly inferior 240 x 320 resolution screen, and even worse video recording. However, it can be found for &#x20ac;120 in most markets, which is the same price as the Wave Y. As an added bonus, it keeps it even more compact.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>How about an HTC phone? The Android-powered HTC Explorer is more compact while sporting the same screen, and offers better stills and video. It's currently available for about &#x20ac;140 in most markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini is the ultimate in compact smartphone design. The super mini beats the Wave Y on almost all levels and is ready to match the price too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're firmly against getting an Android phone, Nokia also offer some good alternatives. The Nokia C5-03 and Nokia 500 both offer superior 5MP cameras and higher resolution screens. The 500 is also upgradeable to the latest version of Nokia's Symbian-powered OS, Belle, and runs at about &#x20ac;150. The C5-03 is closer to the Wave Y price range.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you use a phone for little more than calling, the Wave Y more than adequately gets the job done. If you're looking for a budget phone without scraping the bottom of the barrel, it's priced competitively enough to factor into your decision. Some rival budget smartphones are a long shot away, but being comfortably close to Samsung feature phones may actually work in its favor.</paragraph>
