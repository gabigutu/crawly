			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Designed to a flagship standard and powered by the latest in handheld computing, the Optimus G cannot hope for a warm welcome from rivals but is due every bit of their respect. LG is not asking for it - it's getting ready to earn it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Early on this season, LG was looked upon to put the missing piece in the Android quad-core puzzle. It delivered that alright with the Optimus 4X HD, but were far from done. Their Optimus G completes what's nothing short of a grand slam, and does so with a flourish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G is the first phone to market globally with an S4 Pro chipset. Four Krait cores and next-gen Adreno 320 graphics are getting a scary snap out of Snapdragon. Kraits have better per-core performance and have demonstrated it in numerous benchmark tests. And having four of them in one place is a promise of a major speed boost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there's more than sheer horsepower to a true flagship and LG have given the design, display and camera their best too. You can safely say the Optimus G has every piece of top-notch technology currently available. The 13MP camera is a first for LG and the screen boasts some impressive credentials as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is little LG could've done better, apart from pushing ahead with Jelly Bean perhaps. The non-expandable storage is a slight disappointment but if that's the price to pay for the beautifully slim body, we'd take it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having already gotten a feel for the Optimus G, we cannot wait to take it out for a proper spin. There's plenty to test and explore, so let's get busy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new processor architecture is matched on the outside by a bold and assertive, though not exactly brand new, design. There're novelties in screen and battery technology, as well as imaging and media. But the first things on our list are, as usual, the design and build. So, who's up for a ride?</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Optimus G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Optimus G is barely bigger than the handsets itself. It packs a charger and USB cable, a single-piece headset and a couple of NFC tags. The headset has flat cabling and cool silver earbuds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last thing to find in the box is a SIM eject pin. LG could have wrapped it instead of simply chucking it in but it's no big deal as long as it doesn't get lost during the factory packaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG doesn't supply a MHL adapter enabling TV-out, but none of the competitors has one bundled either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Optimus G 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 131.9 x 68.9 x 8.5 mm, the Optimus G is a tad more compact than its main rival, the Galaxy S III, and almost the same size as its predecessor, the Optimus 4X HD. The Optimus G fits a display with a wider aspect ratio of 16:10 in virtually the same body as the Optimus 4X HD, thanks to the so-called Borderless design that minimizes the screen bezel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G weighs 145g, which is 12g more than the Galaxy S III. It's not a difference that will be badly felt in daily use. The LG flagship is pleasantly solid, but the straight-etched sides don't allow as good grip as the curvy Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G styling isn't exactly new - you can spot the Prada influence that spilled down to the L-series as well. What's more important is that the angular design is an emphatic departure from the organically curved Galaxy S III and HTC One X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design is free of embellishments and that's the right approach to a device of this size. Clean lines and straight angles make a simple but strong statement. Gone is the textured back of the Optimus 4X HD, which now may even be considered tacky when compared to the smooth glass covered rear of the Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the finish has nothing to do with what Apple used on their iPhone 4 and 4S. It's actually more akin to Samsung's hyperglaze coating. What's different here is the underlying pattern called "Crystal Reflection" finish. It is more prominent on a black handset than a white one: because the glass is polarized, the pattern shifts depending on viewing angle and lighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the LG Optimus G, just like its S III rival feels like an all plastic device (if we didn't know it from the LG press materials we'd have a really hard time telling that the back panel is made of glass), which to many isn't quite great for a flagship device. LG made it quite clear that with all the antennas the smartphone packs plastic and glass was its only choice, so you should think of this as the price that needs to be paid for having the monstrous specs in such slim body. Just don't expect to wow anyone by showing them the sides or the back of your Optimus G - leave that to the screen at the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our extended preview was based on the black model a while ago, and we're lucky to have the white Optimus G for this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front is occupied by the huge 4.7-inch True HD-IPS+ LCD display of 768 x 1280 resolution. Whatever color version you choose, the screen bezel will be always black, unlike the Optimus 4X HD, the Galaxy S III or the iPhones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a very thin metal frame running all around the phone's body where the screen glass and the rear cover meet. It is one of the few subtle accents in the Optimus G's design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's take a closer look around. Above the screen we find the earpiece, a couple of hidden sensors and the 1.3MP video-call camera. There is a small status LED right next to the LG logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the 4.7-inch display is the familiar layout of capacitive controls: Back, Home and Menu keys. All three of them are haptic-enabled and pleasantly backlit in white (with a dedicated setting for the backlight duration).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone features the microSIM compartment (you'll need the SIM eject tool to open it) and the volume rocker. It is nicely shaped to accommodate its other role: launching the Quick memo app. You no longer have to press both keys simultaneously, which was rather uncomfortable - pressing right in the middle will do the trick and that's where the volume rocker has a very subtle, but convinient hump.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side has just the Power/Lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the Optimus G is different depending on the region you are in. Our unit came straight from South Korea, hence the T-DMB tuner and telescopic antenna. The Europe-bound phones won't have those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack along with the secondary mic are also on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom hosts the MHL-enabled microUSB port and the primary mic. There are a couple of screws that secure the back as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera lens protrudes from the back slightly, so the phone rests on it. The 8MP variant of the Optimus G has the camera flush with the surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just below the camera is the single-LED flash and diagonally opposite is the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is non-removable - that is to say, not designed to be user removable, but it can probably give in if you undo the screws. Under the cover is a 2100mAh Li-Po battery, developed by LG Chem and promising increased lifespan of 800 charge cycles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional battery test of course and the Optimus G achieved endurance rating of 45h. This means that if you were to use the smartphone for an hour of talking, an hour of web browsing and an hour of video playback per day, you'd need to charge it once every 45 hours.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus LG features a 4.7" True HD-IPS+ LCD screen of 768 x 1280 resolution and 470 nits of brightness. The so-called borderless design is trying to minimize the bezel but doesn't get rid of it completely. There's just enough to let you comfortably hold the phone without worrying that your palm of fingers will touch the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG uses a screen technology called Zerogap touch - basically a laminated screen so there's no air between the screen layers (which causes glare) and it uses in-cell touch technology. The top layer is Gorilla glass for protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the LG Optimus G through our usual display tests and here's how it scored. You can find more about the testing procedures here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the LG Optimus G screen is pretty reflective, which leads to a rather mediocre performance in strong sunlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We snapped a shot of the display under a microscope and here's what the RGB matrix of the Optimus G looks like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus G display matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles are good thanks to the IPS+ tech, but not without some color shift and contrast loss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we put the LG Optimus G side by side with the Galaxy S III and Optimus 4X HD it was clear that the Optimus 4X HD is inferior but the Optimus G has quite decent contrast for a non-AMOLED unit and actually has more accurate color rendering than the over-saturated AMOLED screen on the Galaxy S III. Overall, the image quality is nothing short of impressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G is about the same size as the other Android flagships but does well to set itself apart with its bold and assertive styling. It may not have as good handling as the Galaxy S III, but it comes very close and generally feels pretty comfortable in the hand. The build quality is rock solid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The magnificent screen up front and the excellent handling for a device this size, make the Optimus G a pleasure to use. It may come a few points short of a perfect score for looks, but it still feels like a proper flagship - now let's see if it behaves like one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Optimus UI gets customized deeper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G is powered by Android 4.0.4 ICS with a planned upgrade to Android Jelly Bean later on. The Optimus UI on top of ICS runs deep and adds tones of optimizations including choosing themes, changing the look of icons, choosing between a static or swipe-able wallpaper, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android 4.0 interface is sprinkled with some extra little touches that really make using the UI an enjoyable experience. Those are small tweaks that pop up here and there will surprise you with their usefulness. We'll be sure to point them out to you as we go along. Now, let's get started with a video demo of the flagship Optimus G in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has updated the cool swipe lockscreen, which lets you see what's "underneath" as you unlock the phone. Now, by default swiping a finger at any spot of the lockscreen creates a magnifying glass effect, showing you what's underneath as if you're looking through a rain drop. You can also place up to four shortcuts that will unlock the phone straight into an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the lockscreen clock style as well as the four icons at the bottom with whichever app you choose. That's how it should be done - in HTC's Sense for example, the lockscreen shortcuts always repeat the homescreen shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're at it, the shortcut bar at the bottom of the homescreen is one of the major changes in the Optimus UI. It can now fit up to 6 shortcuts and that's one more than what TouchWiz offers on the Samsung Galaxy S III. You don't have to use all available slots though - you can discard all but the App Drawer shortcut if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the shortcuts are always visible on any of the homescreen panes. With the exception of the app drawer shortcut, you can rearrange, delete or replace any of these with shortcuts of your choosing, even folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the bright color themes and the white system menus, which look very nice on the HD screen. Many aspects of the phone's behavior can be customized, you can go to as small detail as the capacitive key backlight and the transition effect between homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG home-backed tweaks and enhancements are by no means limited to the visuals. The Q Slide option makes it possible for you to watch a video while using other apps, while the system-wide QuickMemo integration allows you to take a screenshot anywhere in the phone and take notes over it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Optimus G LG has also added a landscape mode for the homescreen, which is useful given the 16:10 4.7" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can resize widgets (Ice Cream Sandwich also allows you to resize most widgets, if you want them to take up more or less space) or you can even shrink a widget down to the corresponding app's icon. LG have also added a pinch of Jelly Bean to the ICS Optimus UI - if you move a widget over icons they immediately move out of the way, which is really neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done by tapping and holding on a blank area of a homescreen. A context menu appears, allowing you to add various customizations to your phone. The tabs along the bottom let you select the appropriate app, widget or wallpaper, which you can add to the homescreen of your choice. Gridlines will appear when you hold and drag an app or widget, allowing you to easily place it on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a certain icon isn't to your liking you can always change it to whatever you prefer. There's a wide choice of different icons and you can even choose to make one of your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contextual menu is accessed the straightforward way - just hit the menu button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has also enabled a ton of other customization to the the homescreen looks and behavior. There's a dedicated setting for looped homescreen scrolling and the so-called screen effect changes the transition effect between homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area was also been tweaked by LG to allow you to rearrange the toggle buttons shown there. You are also free to add and remove toggles from the edit menu. You can add an insane amount of shortcuts here, but don't worry that they won't fit on the screen - the row becomes side-scrollable so you can still access them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, if you've got a music track playing in the background, quick controls will show up here. You can also drag notifications to the left or right to dismiss them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default you get seven homescreens to fill up with widgets and shortcuts, but you are free to delete any that you don't need to speed up navigation. You can also set the default homescreen to any of the panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager on board is of the of the ICS variety, which shows you all of the currently running apps, and lets you stop them by swiping them to the left or right. It is accessed by holding down on the hardware home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the Optimus G, LG has added four icons at the bottom, which allow you to quickly open up a particular app or even stop all apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a shortcut to the task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's task manager lists the currently running apps, but also lets you uninstall apps and gives you info on your storage. It comes with its own dedicated widget, which shows a graph of the available RAM and conveniently offers a button to clear up memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer lists all your available apps and widgets, with a dedicated tab for user downloads. There is a button in the top right corner, which triggers edit mode and lets you to easily reorder and uninstall applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to make the icons in the app drawer smaller too. If you select an app whilst in edit mode, a pop up will let you see information like RAM usage, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although styled differently (icons, colors, etc.), the settings menu of the Optimus G is your run of the mill Ice Cream Sandwich menu. It does feature some interesting extras, however. Eco mode lets you choose what Google finds a more low-key approach to managing your CPU, which in turn reduces battery consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG borrowed a trick from Samsung's TouchWiz and implemented its own version of Samsung's Smart Stay - called Wise screen. It uses the front-facing camera to detect if you're looking at the screen. Thus you can browse the phone for hours on end without it auto-locking itself. We can confirm that the feature works very well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>We put the quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro to the test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G is the first device to hit the market with a quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset, meaning it has four Krait cores clocked at 1.5 GHz each, the Adreno 320 GPU inside and the whole package is aided by 2 GB of RAM. Suffice to say that currenty it's widely regarded as king of the hill, supposedly mincing all its contemporary rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've performed a battery of benchmarks on the Optimus G and pitted it against some of the top smartphones currently available on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up was BenchmarkPi, which tests the calculative performance of the processor cores. It's all about the architecture here and the Optimus G comes on top, though not by much, compared to the 32nm cores inside the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack gives the multi-threaded performance of the S4 Pro CPU a run for its money. The Optimus G once again comes out on top by miles ahead of the Exynos Quad inside the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 2 is an all-round benchmark, which gave the nod to the Exynos chipsets inside the Galaxy Note II and S III. The Optimus G is a close third just above the Tegra 3-flaunting HTC One X.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vellamo hits the HTML 5 and CPU points of a smartphone. The Optimus G didn't quite make the cut here finishing second to last, even behind its "outdated" predecessor, the 4X HD.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is another all-round benchmark. The LG Optimus G failed to make a serious impact in the performance rankings.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant is a rather self-minded benchmark, often times pushing some devices ahead of others, which are obviously better. Still the Optimus G got over 7 thousand points, putting it in first place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is an array of GPU-stressing benchmarks, in which the Optimus G got on to a flying start. GLBenchmark Egypt off-screen tests show the GPU's RAW power while ignoring the screen reolution. The Optimus G's Adreno 320 got a good 113 fps, slightly beating the Mali GPU's inside the Galaxy S III and Note II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.1 Egypt (720p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>JavaScript is handled by SunSpider and BrowserMark. The Optimus G didn't really make a strong name for itself here, although it isn't half bad either. The Apple iPhone 5 tops both benchmarks with ease, showing the effort that went into optimizing iOS 6 for browsing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So did the LG Optimus G kick the door in and slapped around the top names in the smartphone world? No. But it did carve a serious claim for the S4 Pro chipset as one of the best, if not the best around. Keep in mind that these benchmark scores will surely move up a notch once Android Jelly Bean gets to settle on the Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the quad-core Krait-clad S4 Pro could have its work cut out for it as we're nearing the mass-release of the A15 architecture to phones and tablets around the world. It is very likely that the new A15-driven processors will run circles around the S4 Pro performance-wise. In any case, things are getting more and more interesting in smartphone land.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Ice Cream Sandwich has, for the most part, very similar functionality to that found on previous Gingerbread iterations. It has a tabbed interface, in which the central tab lists all contacts alphabetically. The LG Optimus G's phonebook tabs can be swiped left and right without the need to touch the specific tabs labels, which a step up from the Optimus 4X HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact images, where available, are displayed and there's a quick alphabet scroll on the right. There's also a regular search bar on top of the contacts list. The other tabs are Groups and Favs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phonebook from getting messy - you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, Twitter contacts and so on). The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed - First Name, Last Name or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a contact photo brings up the quick contacts keys. You can use them to call the contact, send them a message or email or view their profile. A new addition is the option to initiate a video call, which was lacking on the LG Optimus 4X HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the name of a single contact brings up their details. From here, you can edit the contact's info by hitting the pencil icon in the upper right, while the star icon on the upper right will add them to your favorite contacts. Editing a contact is pretty straightforward; you can add or remove fields as needed, as well as specify the types of phone numbers, email addresses, ringtones, additional fields and even add notes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G had no trouble holding on to signal (even where signal was poor) and the in-call audio is consistently good and loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer integrates the Call log, Contacts and Favorites, each within its own tab. Again, these tabs are side-swipe-able for convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is clever and groups some of the calls, e.g. 3 missed calls from the same contact on the same day. A number next to the contact name shows the number of events. It's a great space saving feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works for both numbers and names. Only one matching contact is displayed, but if you tap the down arrow button, the rest show up as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can pop-up the dialer should you need to dial another number. Also you can use the phone while on a call, just hit the menu key and a small green line replaces the notification area and acts like a shortcut back to the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the LG Optimus G and we can tell you right from the get go that it has a very potent speaker on tap. It scored an excellent mark and will undoubtedly be heard loud and clear in most conditions. Aside from that sound was very clear and not just volume-happy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G can handle all common message types: SMS, MMS and email. Email capability is excellent with support for Exchange available out of box, and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of SNS integration as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia to a message is pretty straightforward - just hit the attach button next to the text field and select a number of available options, such as images, videos, voice recording, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted, spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts, and operates in much the same fashion as the Gmail one. If you add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy, although there's no conversation-style view like in Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY, Swype, voice and handwriting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G offers a standard QWERTY keyboard, which features both portrait and landscape typing. The keyboard fills up the screen nicely and offers great ergonomics with ample spacing between keys, still leaving enough room above the keyboard for you to see what you're actually typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of speed and accuracy are commendable in both portrait and landscape. There's a dedicated setting that enables keypress vibrations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Swype-like input as well, though it's somewhat uncomfortably out of sight in the Input Language submenu. You need to enable Shape Writer instead of the standard QWERTY layout in the settings. Voice input is enabled too, as well as handwriting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG gallery is great gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G uses its own custom gallery which is like the stock ICS one but with some added tweaks here and there. It automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored on the phone. By default, images are sorted by albums, but you can sort by location or time as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different sets are tiled neatly across the screen. You can expand or shrink individual albums using a pinch to zoom gesture, making the elements of the grid of photos either really huge or very tiny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once selected, you can view an image close up by pinch zooming or double tapping on the desired area. There is a sliding gallery along the bottom which allows you to quickly browse other images in the album. On the top there are three shortcuts for quickly sharing, editing or deleting the selected photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share feature offers quick sharing via Email, Google+, Picasa, Memo, MMS, SmartShare, Social+ or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of editing options available, ranging from photo effects to cropping and rotation to red eye removal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app displays images in full resolution. Zooming and panning involves no lag whatsoever on the Optimus G.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A music player to like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the LG Optimus G has seen some changes over what we saw on the Optimus 4X HD. The interface is completely revamped and is now easier to use with various tweaks that ease navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip songs back and forth. The interface now has a metallic look to it instead of the dark grey theme of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a search menu, if you need to look up the title, artist or the album. After that you can pick where to search - your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search. Flipping the device to landscape mode while on the Now playing screen squeezes in a list of other songs by the same artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets, which become available when you plug in a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're playing a song it also gets displayed in the notification area, where you can pause and change tracks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player goes beyond... the video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Optimus G has a fairly simple interface, giving you just a grid of all the videos on the device. There's an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can, of course, play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization. For each video you've started, the thumbnail gets a tiny clock icon, which shows how far into the video you've gone in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated either, yet it's quite powerful - in fact the video player was the focal point of most of the custom features developed for the LG Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The live preview while viewing a video is gone, sadly. It was a YouTube-esque pop up preview of the video above the scrubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get the basics out of the way, the available controls during playback include a scrubber for jumping to various parts of the video along with the standard play/pause and skip buttons. There's a Dolby Mobile toggle as well. LG have implemented MX Player-like controls too - a swipe left or right will move the video forward or backwards, while a swipe up or down will influence brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new additions is a Video Speed control (you can set values from 0.5x up to 2x). There's a lock button too, which hides all controls for pure full-screen viewing. Another new feature in the video player is Live Zooming. You can zoom in (with a pinch) during actual playback and we mean some serious zoom length, not just a quick resize or fit to screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G handled everything we threw at it - DivX, XviD, MKV and MP4/MOV up to, and including, 1080p resolution. The AC3 audio codec (among lots of others) is supported, so you don't have to worry about the sound either. There are no limitations for the bitrate, file size, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles (both Latin and non-Latin) are supported with settings for font, color, font and size. You can toggle subtitles on and off, but there's no option to manually point to a subtitle file, so the subtitle filename has to match the video filename.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG took Samsung's pop-up play feature a whole lot further with Q Slide. A dedicated virtual button takes the video from the player to the UI - anywhere in the UI. In portrait mode the video is a thumbnail, which is dead-locked at the top of the screen, while in landscape it takes up the whole display. The unique feature here is the slider, which directly controls the opacity of the video layer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way the underlying user interface can be more or less visible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is nicely clean, if somewhat quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD audio output was pretty disappointing, but the company has obviously learned its lesson and here comes the LG Optimus G with some of the cleanest output we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The below average volume levels aside, the Optimus G results came out excellent in the first part of our test. When connected to an active external amplifier, the smartphone produces excellently clean output with no weak points whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more impressively, stereo crosstalk is the only area of its performance to suffer noticeably when we plugged in a pair of headphones. On that occasion the LG Optimus G produced one of the cleanest outputs we have seen. The volume levels don?t drop like on most of the Optimus G rivals, either, so they can qualify as average on this occasion.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G comes with a 13 megapixel camera, capable of producing still shots with a resolution of 4208 x 3120 pixels. There is a single LED flash, but as usual it won't be of much help in most low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the camera user interface, which consists of two bars of shortcuts to be quite convenient. At the right you get the usual still camera/camcorder switch, the virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut, which lets you quickly preview your recently captured images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If using the onscreen shutter isn't your cup of tea, you can use the volume rocker to snap a photo. It lacks the half press to focus functionality, but then again, so does the virtual control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you can capture shots using only your voice. There's a dedicated entry in the settings to activate the voice shutter and once you have done so, you can use one of five words to trigger it. "Cheese" and "Smile" were to be expected, but "LG", "Kimchi" and "Whisky" work too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left bar of the camera interface holds five shortcuts, four of which you can customize to your liking. The last one is the extended settings menu, which holds the option to edit the bar, along with the options that didn't make it to the bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G camera interface lets you set the resolution, ISO, white balance, focus mode (auto, face-tracking), shot mode (normal, continuous shot, panorama or HDR), geo-tagging on/off, preset scenes, color effects and brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a cool time machine option, which allows the Optimus G to capture shots before you have pressed the shutter key. This comes in handy for those cases when the action is too quick and you are worried you might miss the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Optimus G is doing well, without being overly impressive. The produced photos have accurate colors, but the overly aggresive noise reduction wipes off most of the fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few shots we've taken with the LG Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also done a few macro samples with the Optimus G. The smartphone's camera can focus from pretty close range, allowing to go really close to the subject.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G joins the long list of tested devices in our photo comparison tool. Unfortunately the higher resolution didn't really give the Optimus G an edge against the Galaxy S III and the One X. The three did almost identically well on the ISO chart and while the Optimus G did have a slight advantage on the second chart it was the worst of the three in the third one. The page of the tool has information on how to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Optimus G in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>There's 1080p video recording, too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G camera is capable of shooting 1080p videos at 30fps. The camcorder shares its interface with the still camera, but offers fewer settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can adjust the exposure and the white balance, add a color effect or toggle audio recording. The video recording resolution can also be lowered to 720p, 480p or even as low as QCIF if you need to conserve space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is still no way to change the focus mode - it's always set to continuous, but unlike the Optimus 4X HD, the Optimus G has no issues with that. Given that LG already addressed the issue on its former flagship with a firmware update, the lack of problems here is hardly a surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The option to capture still shots while recording video is present here as well, though its implementation isn't as good as we hoped. Instead of capturing full-res still (or at least ones cropped to match the 16:9 aspect of the video), the Optimus G does 1920 x 1080 shots, which renders the feature pretty useless. After all you already have such images as frames in your videos, so having them as separate images is hardly giving you much extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the videos is good overall, but their dynamic range is rather limited and the resolved detail isn't all that impressive. You might want to keep the exposure compensation to -0.3 or -0.7EV in scenes where wider dynamic range is required to prevent the highlights from clipping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, the colors are accurate, and the contrast is pretty good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample taken with the Optimus G.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In our video comparison tool, the Optimus G didn't quite manage to match the HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S III performance in either good or bad lighting. The Optimus G videos are still perfectly usable, but it's obviously lagging behind the One X and, particularly the Galaxy S III on this occasion.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G comes with a wide range of connectivity options. It has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for global roaming and three-band HSDPA with 21 Mbps of download and 5.76 Mbps of upload. Wi-Fi is dual-band with a/b/g/n support, DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and Hotspot capabilities. There is NFC and Bluetooth 4.0 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartShare is an app that lets you control a DLNA network - you can play media from other devices (e.g. NAS) on your phone or play something from the phone onto another device (e.g. a DLNA-enabled TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi Direct is a technology, which enables devices to connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty of it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to an eventual Bluetooth demise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board in the form of a dedicated app called LG Tag+. From there you can create, read and send NFC tags. With NFC you can share contacts, URLs, memos, messages, calendar events or even a call request to another NFC-enabled device or a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also store information, a profile preset or some action in a blank tag and then use it to make the phone perform an action every time you touch that tag - for instance launch a SatNav app when you touch the in-car tag or change your ringing profile when you touch your designated tag at the office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MHL-enabled USB port is one of the most valuable connectivity options that the LG Optimus G offers. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. Sadly, there isn't an adapter included in the retail box, so you'll have to purchase one separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you plug the dongle into the phone you also need to plug a charger into the additional microUSB port on the dongle and the Optimus G screen will be mirrored on the TV. What's even more impressive is the LG Optimus G Dual screen/dual play feature, which allows you to have different content on your smartphone screen and on the larger connected display. This way you can easily check on Facebook, while streaming a movie to your TV (if you are this sort of person), or turn the Optimus G into a powerful presentation tool (you have the remote with possibly some side notes on your phone and the slides on an HDTV) .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB port has yet another feature - it enables USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (again, there isn't one in the box) but this one is fairly straight forward - you plug it into the Optimus G and plug a standard USB cable on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity option worth noting is the 3.5mm audio jack on top of the Optimus G.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G features the standard Android browser (with some LG modifications on top), but also comes with Chrome preinstalled so you are given a choice right from the start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard browser offers the typical minimalist interface, with the address bar (used both for typing web addresses and initiating web searches) on top and a control bar at the bottom (with options hidden by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling down moves the address bar out of view. The bottom control bar houses the back and forward keys, homepage shortcut as well as new window and bookmarks keys. You can hide that bar by dragging it down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. A more minimalist UI is available from the Labs entry of your settings page. It hides most of the browser's user interface and gives you a quick five-button panel when you slide your finger from one of the screen edges inwards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser offers the ability to save a cached copy of any page you're currently browsing onto your phone. If you choose a website and go to 'save for offline reading', you can then open it from the Saved section of your bookmarks, even when you're no longer connected to the internet. This is great for long articles, as you can save them for those times when you don't have web access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G supports double tap zoom and pinch zoom. There's text reflow too - it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you've pinched to zoom in, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find on page, always request desktop site and share page options are available from the advanced menu. If you tap and hold on some text you get the usual markers and select/copy/find/web search/share options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a history section in addition to the Saved pages list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The powerful quad-core hardware enables the Optimus G browser to play 1080p Flash video without a hitch. But if Flash content is what you are after you will have to side-load the app as it's no longer available through the Play Store. We did so on our unit and everything worked trouble-free. You can play touch-optimized Flash without breaking a sweat too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Well covered organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G comes with the usual set of organizing apps and there's a preloaded document viewer and editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is Polaris Office and it's one of the most advanced mobile editors we've seen. You can of course view documents - Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and PDF files too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit mode offers almost a full set of options - text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables. If you're editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, merge cells and so on. Even creating a full PowerPoint presentation is possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also doubles as a file manager and integrates with Box.net.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has a split screen interface - the top part is reserved for the monthly calendar and one on the bottom for the agenda/daily/weekly view. This way you will always have your monthly view visible. The border line between the two sections is not fixed and you can easily move it. You can hide the monthly view completely, but you can't do the same with the other section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to enjoy the calendar in full screen without any additional views, just turn the phone landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. You can also view events from three different calendars: your phone, your email and Google groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G features an alarm clock application, which allows as many alarms as you need to be set, each with its own launch time, sound and repeat pattern. You can enable application link, so the calendar/email/music player/ tasks/weather app launches after the alarm goes off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a clever feature called puzzle lock, which will make you solve a simple puzzle to disable the alarm. This way you will only be able to stop the ringing when you have properly woken up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Timer, World Clock and Stopwatch features are also part of this app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a useful voice recorder and a nicely touch-optimized calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app allows you to take notes and add media to them, such as images, audio, or location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called QuickMemo function is integrated in the phone's OS, allowing you to capture screen shots of anything (including the lockscreen!) and scribble notes over them like you would on the LG Optimus Vu. A simultaneous press of the up and down buttons of the volume rocker will take the screen shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also Yahoo-powered weather, news and finance apps - any issues you might face with those can be resolved by downloading one of the many alternatives from the Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Social integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are no dedicated Facebook, Twitter or MySpace apps preinstalled. Luckily, the Social+ widget is here, along with the Facebook and Twitter contact sync. Once properly configured, the Social+ widget will show your Facebook news feed and Twitter updates, the latest Twitter mentions and your social messages. The gallery has Social+ integration so you can easily share photos onto Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G does come with the Google+ and Messenger apps. Google+ lets you view trending profiles, as well as feeds from all your circles, while the messenger app lets you quickly chat with any of your Google+ contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, while they do not come with the phone, you can always download the official Facebook and Twitter apps from the app marketplace.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus G managed to get a GPS lock in about a minute from cold start without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection. Initial route planning requires data to be enabled, though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play app market, previously known as the Android Market, lets you download various apps for your device. Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.). You can also see if updates are available for your currently installed apps by going to My Apps in the contextual menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG SmartWorld app store is also on board. It's similar to the SamsungApps market - there you can find various content and promotions exclusive to LG users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Safe to say, LG has done it - all the right pieces are put together in what's a good-looking and powerful smartphone. And unlike the Optimus 4X HD, the Optimus G isn't trailing behind the competition. This time LG is ahead of the pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The powerful S4 Pro chipset will make sure that you get as smooth a smartphone ride as you can possibly find. We are not just talking benchmark scores and bragging rights here - the LG Optimus G really moves around at the speed of your thought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is quite impressive too even though, depending on your preferences, it might come just short of the best around. And the camera delivers quite decently. As long as the relatively high--resolution 13MP sensor doesn't lead you to expect miracles, you should be quite happy with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing about the LG Optimus G that raises doubt is the stubborn insistence, bordering on a pathological obsession, to match whatever it is that Samsung has - from the hyperglaze finish to the Nature UX. It leaves a cheap impression and betrays an inferiority complex. When you have the most powerful smartphone, ripples and bubbles on the lockscreen are irrelevant. And by the way, LG's Q Slide is better than Samsung's Pop-up Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choice of finish won't be everyone's cup of tea but that was the case with the Galaxy S III too. Sure, LG had their reasons for going with plastic and glass, but then again so did HTC for the ONE X and Nokia for the Lumia 800 and they managed better than the Koreans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's just nit-picking though - the Optimus G isn't a smartphone that we would mind carrying around. The gorgeous screen is where all the attention will be focused anyway, and the loading times are so short, you won't have much time to waste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And yet, we hope that LG realizes that putting together a great package only ticks off the first item on the to-do list. There's no escaping the fact that Samsung has already delivered Jelly Bean to the Galaxy S III and the Optimus G is still stuck on Ice Cream Sandwich. The Optimus UX may have managed to catch up with Nature UX, but a flagship can't be excused for not running the latest version of the platform available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The drama surrounding the Optimus 2X ICS update dealt a severe blow on LG's reputation, and the fact that the Optimus 4X HD is still on the JB waiting list doesn't help either. LG should take extra care not to mess this one up or it would completely use the faith of the tech-savvy users who, when buying a flagship product, would like to be treated to the latest and greatest software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's crucial for LG to deliver the update before the holiday shopping spree and unlock the Optimus G's full (market) potential. With Google's event fast approaching this October, there's a good chance that come Christmas, Ice Cream Sandwich will be succeeded twice. At that point, LG should have at least delivered one update and committed to the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not look too far in the future and see what the Optimus G is up against if you are in the market for a smartphone right now. Currently pre-orders for the smartphone are going at about &#x20ac;599 and that will probably be as much as the handset will cost at launch. We expect it to settle at about &#x20ac;499 a couple of weeks later at which point the fight between it and the Galaxy S III should boil down to value-adding software features or personal design tastes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll be comparing the LG Optimus G and the Galaxy S III in more detail in a dedicated article later on, but here goes the short version. The Optimus G has more pixels and, thanks to its full RGB matrix, a slightly sharper screen, but it lacks the natural contrast of the Galaxy S III AMOLED. Still, the LG flagship has its rival handily beat in terms of performance. On the other hand, the Galaxy S III has Jelly Bean already, so this may be as close a call as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One X recently got a slight update in the face of HTC One X+. The two Tegra 3-powered smartphones can't match the LG smartphone in terms of performance, but can still offer more than reasonable speed and are more attractively priced. Couple that with a slightly better design (particularly on the One X+) and an equally good screen and it might be worth the trade-off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC One X &#x2022; HTC One X+</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end of the day, geeks who are looking for the ultimate performance have little choice, but to opt for the LG Optimus G. As smartphones learn more and more tricks, two things get increasingly important - computing power and screen (both in terms of real estate and image quality) and LG has nailed them both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has finally has a flagship to be proud of and one that's an OS update away from being the Android smartphone others have to work hard to match.</paragraph>
