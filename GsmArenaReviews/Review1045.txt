			<paragraph>The touchscreen revolution wasn't equally kind to all big phone makers. Samsung and Apple were quick to spot the opportunity and got propelled to the top, very much at the expense of the likes of BlackBerry and Nokia. And while the Finns thought the best way to turn their fortunes around was to join forces with Microsoft, BlackBerry is trying to stay afloat on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The revenue the BlackBerry Z10 will bring is probably not lifesaving for a company that still isn't too deep in the red, but it's the message they're trying to send that's so important. Challenging the establishment with a brand new platform isn't something you do in just one try. The Z10 has to convince users that BlackBerry has what it takes to compete with the best. After a certain point, this is less about skill and strategy, and more about motivation and commitment.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Z10 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry says it has finally created a smartphone that will no longer target corporate users only, but one that average Joes will crave. The problem is we've seen the Canadians make that promise before, so we'll have to see it to believe it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rebranding the company and dropping the confusing naming scheme looks like a good move. Enough of the RIM Blackberry Torch 9800, 9810, 9850, etc. nonsense - you simply get a BlackBerry Z10 now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now that you can easily ask the guy at the shop to show you the right smartphone, let's see if it can actually inspire you to reach for your wallet. A proper hardware examination is due and it starts right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Z10 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z10 measures 130 x 65.6 x 9 mm, which isn't too big for a smartphone with a 4.2" screen. We've seen better of course, with the Motorola Razr M/Razr i duo measuring 122.5 x 60.9 x 8.3 mm and featuring 4.3" displays. The difference in width goes down to the different screen aspect - 15:9 for the Z10 and 16:9 for the Moto phones. It seems BlackBerry could have done better with the space above and below the display. On a second thought, considering that swipes are central to the navigation and many of them start off the screen, they have an excuse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that the BlackBerry Z10 is pretty easy to handle (it's just not as good as it could have been). At 137.5g the smartphone also strikes a good balance between solid feel in the hand and comfortable carrying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry has done a solid job with the BlackBerry Z10 design. With the touchscreen bar form factor admittedly offering little creativity, the Canadians have crafted a handset which has enough character, without being overdesigned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We particularly like the patterned plastic back, which not only looks cool, but also feels nice to the touch and provides excellent grip. The front is not bad either, although certain similarities to the iPhone will have some people impressed for the wrong reasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At any rate, the BlackBerry Z10 is a nice looking smartphone, that no one will mind being seen with. It also feels pretty sturdy, so chances are looks won't fade too quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A key difference between the BlackBerry Z10 and its smartphone rivals to run the major platforms (iOS, Android and WP) is the lack of any hardware buttons at the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you get below the display is the microphone pinhole, while above you'll spot the earpiece, the ambient light and proximity sensors, as well as the front-facing camera and the status LED. The LED alerts you of anything from incoming calls through BBM and regular messages, to the battery status and social network updates. You can selectively enable the events you need or disable LED notifications altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no home button to let you wake up the phone without reaching for the power key, but the Z10 was designed not to need it. Instead, you can simply do a vertical swipe on the screen and the smartphone will wake up. Yep, that works right from sleep, which is one better than the Nokia N9's solution where a double tap wakes the phone up before you swipe to unlock it. If you are worried that you'll trigger the unlock by accident you can disable it from settings and use the Z10 the old-school way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The heavily gesture-based UI means there are not too many controls on the sides either. On the right you get a couple of volume keys, separated by the voice command button. You can set the volume keys to double as music controls, allowing you to skip tracks. Sadly, there's no camera shutter key here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two connectivity ports are on the left - the microUSB and microHDMI jacks are both left uncovered, which admittedly doesn't look all that great. They're readily accessible, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the BlackBerry Z10 features the secondary microphone, the 3.5mm audio jack and the power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is bereft of controls: you'll only spot a slit to place a fingernail and pull the battery cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pattern on the back is interrupted only by the 8 megapxiel camera lens, the LED flash and the BlackBerry logo. The logo sits right on top of the NFC transmitter, so it's an indication of the strongest signal point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the BlackBerry Z10 back panel rests the 1800 mAh removable battery and the two card slots - microSIM and microSD, the latter being hot-swappable. We are really glad BlackBerry didn't go for an embedded battery as more and more OEMs are taking this route recently. We'll know how good the battery is when we are done with the full review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A pretty good 4.2" display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z10 offers a 4.2" display with an aspect ratio of 15:9 and WXGA resolution (1280 x 768 pixels). Those figures add up to a nicely sounding 355 ppi pixel density, which means the screen is tack sharp and you?d be hard pressed to discern individual pixels. It's not as good as the Oppo Find 5 and its 1080p 5-incher, but you'd have to be looking from way closer than feels comfortable to tell the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is quite good, too. Contrast is good, viewing angles are very wide and colors are very lively. The Z10 is not the best in any of these aspects but it's close enough to the top to make everything on the screen look punchy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum brightness setting does seem a little low to us and there's no way for you to disable the automatic brightness control. The reflectivity of the screen is reasonably low, so we didn't have any issues with sunlight legibility.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface is fluent in gesture<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry 10 is a bold step up from the previous versions of the OS. If we had to put things in perspective we'd say it's as big as Microsoft's leap from Windows Mobile to Windows Phone. The new OS is unafraid to experiment and clearly designed to impress. BlackBerry has obviously been paying attention to what others were doing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OS has bits of WebOS and Meego in it - swipes and backgrounding - but also Android (some contextual menus) and iPhone (the rich elaborate graphics). Only the icon design and some deeper system menus allow but a mere glimpse into the BlackBerry of old. Not that the comfort of loyal users was of utmost importance. You just can't expect to feel right at home in an OS that skips straight to 10 from 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not rush it then - check out the BB 10 in action running on the Z10 here:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It takes a swipe up from the bottom of the screen to unlock the Z10 (it's important to note that swipes start off the screen). Interestingly, a single swipe will unlock the phone even if the screen is off. It's a unique feature - no need to wake up the device first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's up to you to decide whether you just want to check out notifications on the lockscreen, without unlocking the phone, or unlock the device and go straight to what you were doing. A short swipe is the Blackberry equivalent of Meego's double-tap-to-wake-up. A longer swipe will unlock - and it's not too hard to get the hang of it. The Power/Lock key can be used as well of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen itself shows a good deal of info - the time and date, the next event in your calendar, message counters and there's a camera shortcut. A swipe down from the top launches a dim, red clock - great in the dark since it doesn't hurt your eyes with bright light. A tap on the screen brings up the option to set an alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry 10 homescreen consists of multiple panes, two of which have a special purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer takes up most of the homescreen panes - it's a paged grid of shortcuts of all installed apps. A long press on an icon starts edit mode, which lets you rearrange icons and uninstall apps with a single tap (deleting obviously works only for non-system apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you have at least one app running a special pane appears to the left of the app drawer panes. It holds up to eight "active frames" (similar to the Web OS cards), each of which is (typically) a thumbnail of a running app. Not all frames are just a downsized screenshot of the app, some switch to something more informative. For example, the Phone app switches to a list of recent calls, which is big enough to read comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frames are arranged chronologically and have a small x button when you don't need them any longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between apps is done with the same swipe up gesture used for unlocking the phone. No matter where you are in the interface, it will bring you to the task switcher page. One thing to note here is that as you swipe up and the current app is pushed into the background, message counters appear on its left for the various messaging services that BlackBerry 10 supports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is Peek - named that because it lets you check new incoming messages with minimum interruption. If the message doesn't seem important, you can bring your finger back down and you will return to the current app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If just the message source isn't enough to tell you how important it is and should you need to drop the current app, you can continue swiping to the right. This continuous L-shaped swipe (up, then right) will push the current screen off to the side, revealing BlackBerry Hub. If you release your finger, you'll go into Hub to read the message, or you can just reverse the gesture and go back to working within the current app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hub is always the leftmost pane on the homescreen and can be accessed either by the swipe up then right gesture or by tapping the small indicators at the bottom of the screen. Those immediately take you to the respective pane. You can swipe your finger over them to quickly scroll through all homescreen panes if you're not sure where to find the thing you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get back to Hub in a moment - it's the heart of BlackBerry 10 and perhaps the strongest weapon against competing OSes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one more important swipe gesture that will come in use often - a swipe from the top. This has two functions. On the homescreen it brings out a shade of quick toggles (Settings, Rotation lock, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Alarm and Notifications). In an app, it brings out an app-specific list of options (think Menu key in Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's a handy way to replace a dedicated Menu button, though things are a bit inconsistent and some apps do have a menu button in the bottom right corner of the screen. Another issue is that quick toggles are only accessible on the homescreen, so you have to get out of the current app if you want to switch Wi-Fi on, for example. This sort of defeats the purpose of quick toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z10 packs a dual-core Krait processor and 2GB of RAM - that's enough to run Android smoothly, but BB 10 OS has been tailor-made for this hardware (or vice-versa) and everything works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.2" screen is very responsive and doesn't miss taps. BlackBerry has made sure to leave enough room around it, so the swipe gestures can be executed comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get used to all the swipe gestures, BB 10 OS can be fast to operate, but the problem is getting there in the first place. It's a problem we think Windows 8 has too - without an obvious UI element (e.g. a button), a user will have to interact with invisible things that only come into the open when you do the right gesture. BlackBerry better hope people see their ads to learn about these gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the swipe down for quick toggles -or- app options (which may be elsewhere) wasn't confusing enough, the Hub makes it even more confusing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Hub is a messaging power house<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerries were the phone of choice for business users and they have to deal with tons of messages - so the interface has to be very efficient. And the BlackBerry Z10 saddled with the new Hub is as efficient as they come. Perhaps only Windows Phone is close when it comes to unified messaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hub is pretty simple at first glance - a list of messages with an icon that indicates the service (SMS, BBM, email, Twitter or Facebook, but also calls and voicemails) and also flags messages read or unread (color icons are for unread messages, monochrome icons are for read messages). Messages are indexed by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tap on a message to read it and you can respond to that message from the same screen too. That's great because you don't have to worry about where a message came from, you just type a response and it will be sent back through the proper channel. Getting back to the Hub is done either by the Back button in the lower-left corner or by a swipe right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the list of messages is too much of a mess, there's Search or you can swipe right to reveal a list of all services that feed messages into the Hub. You can then filter messages by service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's where the whole swiping business starts to get a little confusing. First, the Hub can also show you your agenda - swipe down to view it. But make sure the swipe starts from inside the screen (think "pull down to refresh" on iPhone). If you start from above the screen, the gesture will bring up the quick toggles instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not the end of it either - a right swipe leads you to the list of all services piped into Hub, a swipe left (or tap on the right side of the screen) brings you back to Hub. BUT if you start the swipe from the just outside the right side of the screen, you might end up on the task switcher pane instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Confused yet? There's a more refined way to filter Hub - the down arrow in the top right corner. Using this interface, you can search for individual folders (e.g. Inbox, Outbox, Missed calls, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a menu button in the lower-right corner of Hub, which brings out some handy options like Scroll to top (or bottom), search, compose, refresh, select multiple. You already have Search and Compose buttons at the bottom of the screen, but the others can be useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message management skills of the Hub don't end there - a long press on a message brings out a long list of options on the right. You can "drag" a message to one of these options in the same gesture or lift your finger and tap the option you like, whatever seems easier. The three vertical dots button expands the pane with options to include labels, not just icons - you'll need that at first, until you learn what icons stand for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More than one message can be selected here, but if you select messages from different sources, only the options that apply are displayed (e.g. you can mark both emails and tweets as "unread", but you can't tag tweets, only emails). The multiple select can be used for mass delete too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z10 has no hardware buttons so the quickest way to get to the dialer is by tapping the Phone shortcut in the bottom left corner (it's visible on all homescreen panes but the Hub).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer has three tabs - Calls, Contacts and Dial pad. We were a little disappointed to find out that you can't swipe between those two (after all, you can swipe between almost anything else so far).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer has been pushed to third place because it's not very useful - with no smart dial, you have to enter the number manually. There is a feature called "Smart dialing" but it's not the usual "find as you type" feature. Instead, it only automatically applies country and area codes to the numbers you dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice option for those still using cellphone holsters is the option to automatically answer and hang up when taking the Z10 out of the holster and putting it back in again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, you're better off using the Contacts tab. It's an alphabetical list of contacts indexed by their first letter. There's a search field and an alphabet index available for quickly jumping to a specific contact. A tap on a contact expands into a list of all assigned phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log features three shortcuts on top - Voice Mail plus two contact numbers. You can add more quick-dial numbers here, but the more you add, the further down the actual call log gets pushed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log itself displays either all calls or just missed calls (there's a toggle just above it). Calls are grouped together to save space, e.g. two outgoing calls to the same contact are displayed as one item with a call counter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook looks a lot like the Contacts tab of the phone app, except it doesn't have the alphabet index on the right (but the search field on top is still there). Tapping on a contact here brings you to the contact info, which is split into three tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first tab is details - this is where all the phone numbers, email accounts, web site, birthday and other info (including Facebook friends and Twitter followers count) are listed. If the same contact uses multiple services, you can link the entries and have everything in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is Updates. All social networking updates are listed here chronologically, along with automatically generated entries under the Company News heading. If you've entered a company name (or the phone can guess it from the social networking accounts associated with this contact), the phone will search the web for new relevant content and give you a four line preview. A neat feature for sure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab is Activity, a list of phone calls and messages between you and the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like in the Hub, you can swipe right to view a list of all services that provide contacts - your phone, the SIM card in it, BBM and BBM Video, Gmail, Twitter, you name it. You can use this to browse contacts coming from a specific service only or go into the settings to hide contacts from services you don't need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found this bit to be a bit buggy - we'd switch off a service (say Facebook) and the contacts from it will still be visible. We had to go through the swipe-right interface to a single service (any will do) and then back to All contacts for the list to refresh. The same thing happens when enabling a service back again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another trick from Hub is the long press - this gives you an easy access to several options straight from the contact lists. It's especially quick if you do it as one gesture (press and hold on a contact then move your finger to the option and release).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wide-ranging connectivity is a little frustrating<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z10 covers the whole connectivity spectrum with four different versions. All of them have quad-band 2G GSM and 3G GSM (HSPA), but there are some key differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The STL100-1 is the basic model - 2G, 3G with 21Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA. Then come STL100-2 and STL100-3 models, which add LTE to the mix (100Mbps down, 50Mbps up). The difference between the two are the 3G and 4G bands they support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the STL100-4 piles on CDMA with EV-DO Rev. A on top (though it supports fewer HSPA and LTE bands). Anyway, stores will offer the right model for your country and carrier, so you don't need to worry about it too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whichever model you get, you'd be all set for fast global connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is fully featured as well. Dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n handles local Internet connections and Bluetooth 4.0 handles accessories. There's also microUSB port with Mass Storage support for data connectivity with a computer and a standard microHDMI port for TV-Out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board, allowing easy exchange of data. You can use the dedicated app to create tags (e.g. a tag with contact info), which you can send to another NFC-enabled phone. The app also handles reading tags and storing the data for when you're on the receiving end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You don't need NFC to transfer tags either - the BlackBerry Z10 can create a QR code and read QR codes too, which is great for communicating with phones that don't have NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're here, we have to go over BlackBerry Link - the PC Suite for the Z10. The phone has the install file, just plug it in and install the app. Unfortunately, you need it for Mass Storage to work, quickly copying over some files isn't an option unless Link is installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has its advantages though - once everything is installed, the phone storage will appear as a drive on your computer. You don't even need the USB cable, the phone will appear as a network drive once it's on the same Wi-Fi network as the computer (you can disable this if you like).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Link can schedule phone backups and automatic sync of content (both docs and multimedia). That's great with the Wi-Fi option - it will seamlessly sync your docs at work and then your music at home, you don't need to do anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that is great, but needing the app to install the right drivers is annoying. They didn't even install properly the first time around and we had to go through the Windows' Device Manager to get them to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if BlackBerry is going to force Link on us, they should have made sure it works glitch-free. And it's not. The first thing we tried was to drag and drop some documents into the app, but it didn't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Link only supports dragging files from one place in the app to another (but you can use the Mass Storage option and save yourself the trouble). So, we added the folder with the documents and dragged them over through Link, but while doing so we noticed how long it took the app to scan a folder with four docs in it. Scanning phone content isn't speedy either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To top it all off, BlackBerry Link crashed a couple of times. iTunes and Zune are not the most well-liked apps around, and a buggy Link is not what we wanted to see. Okay, we got this off our chest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, if you leave it in the background to do its syncing/backing up duties and use your OS's file explorer, the experience is good overall. But a sour first impression makes us wish BlackBerry just used standard Mass Storage or MTP and spent a little more time on polishing Link.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browser keeps Flash alive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z10 has a WebKit-based browser with full Flash support. The 4.2" WXGA screen isn't as big as most droid flagships at the moment, but it is still bigger and sharper than that of an iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is pretty straightforward. The first thing you see is the New tab interface, which shows thumbnails of recently visited sites. It's a bit annoying that these can't be deleted. There's no Incognito/Private mode either, so be careful what sites you open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering URLs is pretty quick thanks to the autocomplete feature, which managed to guess correctly what we're trying to type most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the UI that displays websites is pretty Windows Phone-like - the web page takes the whole screen, except for a line at the bottom (it even covers the status bar at the top of the screen). The line at the bottom holds a Tab switcher button, Back button, URL field and a Menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tab switcher button brings up a list of currently open tabs, along with Bookmarks, History and a New tab shortcut. The current page you're browsing is pushed to the right to reveal all those. Instead of tapping the Tab switcher button, you can swipe to the right but the gesture needs to begin at the bottom where the Tab button is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can be a short swipe - just enough for the option icons to show up and get docked on the left side of the screen. That seems like a handy way to keep those options and tabs always visible, but they hide as soon as you tap anything - a missed opportunity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the browser is very fast and elaborate web sites are rendered without a hitch. Pinch zooming is smooth and there's double-tap to zoom too, but no text reflow. From the Menu button you get access to several more options, including Find on page and Share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool option has the browser remember which tabs were open, so the tabs will still be there even if you close the browser and open it again later (similar to desktop browsers). Another interesting option is Reader - it strips out the site's interface and leaves only the content, making it much easier to read on a phone's screen. It doesn't work very well with multi-page articles though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Z10 has full Flash support - it's among the last active platforms that do. The dual-core Krait processor had no problem playing a 1080p YouTube videos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry did an excellent job with the hardware of the Z10 - it's an attractive and very well-built smartphone. We wish the battery had more juice, but it's user replaceable and compact enough, so it's no problem carrying a spare. If the Z10 ran any other OS, we'd probably be saying it's one of the best phones on that platform - it's got the design and build quality, all the ports and slots, no gimmicky features. It's the brand new platform that's yet to prove itself worthy, and possibly challenge Windows Phone for its spot as the third player in the smartphone wars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Z10</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry 10 OS is almost unrecognizable as a successor to BB 7. The interface takes iOS's love of skeumorphism and combines it with the gesture trend that started with Web OS and MeeGo (both now dead) and continues on with Windows 8 and Jolla.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to say it feels a bit unpolished though - there's a pretty steep learning curve when it comes to all the gestures. We got used to them, but someone coming from the non-touch BlackBerry QWERTY messengers (or even iOS or Android) will be in for a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the BlackBerry Z10 had come out in May last year (when BB 10 OS was first unveiled), it would have sent a cold shiver down the spine of Androids and iPhones. But both platforms and the phones they power have been steadily moving on, squeezing all competing platforms into a very tight corner of the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As things stand now it's perhaps not iOS or Android that BB 10 is competing with but Windows Phone. Both BlackBerry and Microsoft depend on corporate users buying their products and both tout great centralized messaging and enterprise security. They'll attract some casual users too (especially on a bring-your-phone-to-work basis), but the momentum of the two leading platforms is pretty great now and it won't be easy stopping them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, in the year 2013 the BlackBerry Z10 is merely an excellent phone - we're still eager to see what else it has to offer and will be publishing the full review as soon as possible. By the sound of it, BlackBerry users are excited too.</paragraph>
