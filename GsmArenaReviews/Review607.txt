			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not every day we have a true record holder in our hands, and that's exactly what we were getting ready for waiting for the vivo X5Max to arrive. The slimmest smartphone in the world for more than six months now, the 4.75-mm X5Max snatched a crown that had been tossed between the Gionee Elife S5.1 and the Oppo R5, each of them holding it for a fleeting month or so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can then imagine our disappointment when it turned out we have the global version, which is "only" the third-slimmest phone in the world. A fraction of a millimeter thicker than the China model, the vivo X5Max is an extraordinarily slim device nonetheless, most certain to impress with a profile you wouldn't normally attribute to a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It really looks almost like a planar object, its two dimensions much greater that the third, so to speak, in math terms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of hardware, the X5Max is less exciting, relying on the now ubiquitous midrange Snapdragon 615, coupled with the equally commonplace 2GB of RAM. It doesn't skimp on features though sporting a 13MP primary camera behind a fast f/2.0 lens, as well as a 5MP front-facer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 5.5-inch FullHD display helps keep thickness in check thanks to the Super AMOLED tech, while providing the signature colors and contrast. The extra 0.33mm thickness have allowed designers to fit a larger-capacity battery, though it still looks underpowered on paper for its screen size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another in a long line of designer Chinese smartphones, the vivo X5Max relies on the proven formula of striking looks and all-round capable hardware. We don't expect it to outperform flagships, but its priorities lie elsewhere and the X5Max scores high on style. While it will certainly be on the short list of anyone looking to stand out, the smartphone needs to prove it has enough substance to match its upmarket exterior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're here to examine it in detail and we kick off with the unboxing and hardware overview.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Luxury packaging, usual contents<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max ships in a square retail box with a few luxury touches. All the accessories come individually wrapped. One small box houses the AC adaptor rated at 5V/2A and a USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-ear headphones are packed in another box complete with a model number and detailed specs - a nice touch for an otherwise regular piece. They have a single-button remote, but no flat cords.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, there's a frosted plastic bumper cover for the back of the smartphones, which wraps around the corners as well. Why you'd want to put it on a device you bought for its slim profile is a question we're not prepared to answer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>vivo X5Max 360° spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max is crazy thin, we've already established that. It measures 153.9 x 78 x 5.1mm (or 5.08mm if you want to split hairs) and slimness aside, is a pretty large device for its 5.5-inch display. The engineers simply needed room to fit all the innards somewhere and the phone inevitably had to grow in footprint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a good 5mm worth of bezels on either side of the display, and the overall dimensions of the X5Max are more or less the same as the 5.7-inch Galaxy Note 4. That said, the X5Max is still shorter than the iPhone 6 Plus, though equally wide, so it's not massive after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 156g, the X5Max feels a bit heavier than you'd expect from such a thin phone, but the metal build has had its say and it's a very solid slab.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Body and design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max is built inside an alloy chassis, a single solid piece of aluminum. Most of the back is made of stainless steel, vivo claims, with an anti-fingerprint treatment and it is smooth but not shiny. It doesn't tend to get particularly greasy and even when it does accumulate dirt it's easy to clean up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a couple of plastic strips, top and bottom, which are made of soft matte plastic and likely match the antenna placement, but also serve to house the camera module and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera module sticks out a good 2mm from the back panel, there was no way around it with such a slim profile. To vivo's credit, it is a fast f/2.0 lens and the designers did well to mask the bump by raising the white plastic halfway around the assembly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker has a couple of raised dots to keep it from muffling, but they can't help with the sizeable camera bump, and the device will wobble on a table if you touch it anywhere along its left edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo logo is vertically centered, and we can't decide if the shiny letters have been aligned less than perfectly, or the offset is a design touch. Then again, we might have spent a touch too long staring at details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front greets you with the 5.5-inch display surrounded by generous bezels, though we've seen worse, and here they're at least justified by the slimness. There's also a millimeter-wide black frame around the display, which you won't notice when the screen is off, but is a bit of an eye sore once you fire it up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least vivo has utilized the bottom bezel with three capacitive buttons, relieving the screen of such duties.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've never been particular fans of extreme tests, but we couldn't resist subjecting the phone to a mild twist. You shouldn't expect military grade sturdiness out of a 5mm-thin device and it does deflect a bit, but does so without making a sound. Overall, it's surprisingly rigid, as long as you don't abuse it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max relies on capacitive buttons in the bottom bezel for navigation in a Menu/Home/Back arrangement. Above the display there's the earpiece in the middle with the 5MP front camera to the left and the proximity/ambient light sensor on the other side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back features the 13MP camera in the top left corner, joined by its single-LED flash and a secondary mic midway between the two. The speaker mesh is mostly a design element, as the actual speaker is no more than a quarter of its length and is situated in its right end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is home to the volume rocker and the power button towards the top and the card slot closer to the bottom. The card tray is made of metal as well, and despite its miniscule thickness is quite sturdy. It will take a micro-SIM and a microSD card or a micro- and a nano-SIM card, but never all three at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a microUSB 2.0 port in the middle of the bottom plate, joined by the primary mic. Up top you'll find the standard 3.5mm headphone jack, a feature Oppo didn't find enough room for on its 4.85mm-thick R5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When holding the X5Max you're constantly amazed at how thin it is, it just doesn't get old. You touch nothing but metal and glass pretty much any way you hold it and it feels refined and expensive. Its edges are a bit sharp on the front and the display is recessed a fraction of a millimeter so 2.5D-spoiled fingers may not be impressed at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single hand operation is helped by the slim waistline and the non-slippery surfaces, but it is a large device, so it's best operated with two hands.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5.5 inches of Super AMOLED goodness<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It you want thin, AMOLED is the way to go, and in the case of the vivo X5Max it's a 5.5-inch FullHD panel. That results in 401ppi, which is more than enough for sharp text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The panel is a fine representative of the AMOLED tech and offers plenty of punch and wide viewing angles, though it does exhibit a greenish tint when viewed from the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no color adjustments to be found in settings, nor is there a glove mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Out microscope shot revealed the expected diamond pentile arrangement, with twice as many green subpixels as any other color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum brightness of the X5Max is good for an AMOLED, but more importantly it's higher than either of the Oppo models as well as the Samsung Galaxy A7. The 50% setting corresponds to about 30% of the maximum, nothing unseen before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the sunlight test the X5Max posted an equally good mark, on par with the LG G Flex2, but somewhat behind the Galaxy A7 this time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For starters, the vivo X5Max is a dual-SIM dual-standby device. One of the cards gets the full 2G/3G/4G treatment with multiple bands each, while the other is limited to 2G. You can set which one is which in the settings and the micro/nano SIM slots mean you can use either form factor as your main card. You'd need to go microSIM though if you value the memory expansion, as the microSD slot is shared with the nanoSIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone has dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n with DLNA, Wi-Fi direct and hotspot support. There's Bluetooth v4.0, but no NFC or FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's GPS with A-GPS for precise positioning over cellular, but for all we know, there's no GLONASS to utilize Russian satellites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB On-The-Go and lets you attach peripherals. A standard 3.5mm jack completes the wired connectivity package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Slim phones typically struggle in this very part of our test for very obvious reasons - less space means less battery capacity. The thinnest 4.75mm vivo X5Max comes with a modest 2,000mAh cell, but the version we have for review is a bit better equipped with a 2,300mAh unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put it simply, the X5Max amazed us in terms of its battery performance. It posted impressive scores across the board, not only considering its screen diagonal and battery size, but also in absolute values. Standby endurance, which is not included in the scorecard, is about 11 full days with a single SIM, and a day less with a second SIM inside. Call times on a 3G network are more than 17 hours, well above average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to on-screen activities, the smartphone is good for nearly 11 hours of video playback - it can easily last you a transatlantic flight with constant movie watching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing is the most taxing on the battery, but it also shows a marked difference between the stock browser and the also available Google Chrome. While the vivo offering manages a little over 6 hours, Chrome is substantially more efficient and with it the X5Max scored upwards of 9 hours of web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android KitKat 4.4.4 with a highly-customizable Funtouch layer on top<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max runs on the company's proprietary thoroughly reworked Funtouch OS, based on Android 4.4.4. The dated OS version is a typical source of complaints we've been having with smartphones originating in China. Although some users prefer to stay away from Lollipop, the general scarcity of OS updates usually means you're left with the version you had out of the box, which is never the best treatment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With this minor rant out of the way, there's actually a lot to like about the Funtouch OS. Though you'll instantly be able to tell it takes its clues from iOS, the interface is not a direct copy, but an Android overlay with its own character.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Jelly Bean based Funtouch on the vivo Xshot we reviewed a while back was a little different in certain elements, but what we said then, largely holds true for the version, which is installed on the X5Max. The menu tree is entirely different from the stock Android arrangement and finding the option you're after may take some sifting through the menus. The lack of a search feature doesn't help either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, there's no bloatware to be found, and the phone comes with only a handful of apps preinstalled, nicely covering the basics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the first modified design element you're greeted with. There's a standard issue clock widget on top, followed by a customizable signature, where you can set up an uplifting quote of sorts. In the bottom half there's an avatar box and you can assign a number of different animated ones or choose a photo from the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlocking only works with an upward swipe, while swiping to the left launches the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Past the lockscreen you get the same single-tiered interface like on iOS with no app drawer. The number of homescreen panes doesn't appear to be limited to a single page of thumbs (which holds 9) and we gave up trying to create more after the 11th. You can rearrange the homescreens any way you like and the one you place first is the default one that appears when you tap the Home button. The panes can be cycled though, so in effect there's no first and last one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is where all your apps will show after installation in a grid of 4x6 icons. You can group them in folders and tapping on a folder shows its contents in a nicely animated popup on a blurred background. There's a dock on the bottom of the homescreen, which takes up to 5 icons, folders included, and redistributes them evenly, depending on the number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Menu button brings out the widget library, as well as the option to select a transition effect for the homescreen panes. You also get the option to hide apps you don't want displayed on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major difference to your average Android interface is vivo's separation of the notification shade and the quick toggles for changing settings. Swiping down from the top brings out the list of notifications where you also get the carrier's name and reminders for upcoming calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meanwhile, swiping up from the bottom edge brings out a combined toggles/brightness/tasks drawer, reminiscent of the iOS Control center. Closing apps works with an upward flick, but there's no Kill all button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness slider doesn't take taps if you want to jump straight to a specific position, instead you need to grab it by the handle each time. There's an Auto switch too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The toggles offer the expected functionality and aside from the simple on/off action work as shortcuts to the respective setting upon a long press. All of them are listed in a singled side-scrollable row, and you can rearrange them or hide unused ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>vivo has also devised a nifty and often useful screen-grabbing utility called S-capture. Chief among its features is the ability to capture long screenshots, for example an entire webpage or a conversation in a messaging app. Alternatively, you could record a video of what's going on the screen, like gameplay or instructional videos. The Funny screenshot option lets you crop a part of the screen with a freeform or preset shape, of which there are a few.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max comes with extensive gesture and motion functionality, found in settings under Smart motion. Smart wake works with the display off and lets you draw letters to launch specific apps, unlock with an upward swipe without lighting the screen beforehand or launch the camera with a downward swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air operation holds options for a quick status glance or air unlock, both triggered by a hand wave at the front camera. The very same gesture works for switching homescreen panes as well as shuffling the gallery images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's smart light which covers three features. One claims to wake up the phone when you take it out of your pocket, next is the familiar double-tap-to-wake in a different wording, and Smart keep bright uses the front camera to detect you're looking at the phone so it doesn't go into standby while you're reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart call contains the gestures for picking up and muting calls, while Smart remind will vibrate when you pick the phone off the table to indicate you have pending notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi window is similar to Sony's Smart apps and pop's up a tiny window where you can watch a video, create or view notes and access your messaging inbox.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've lost count of the number of devices, utilizing Qualcomm's upper-midrange Snapdragon 615 chipset (though a quick free-text search in our Phone Finder returned 36 entries from our database alone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably know, the chipset comes with a dual quad-core processor setup and in the case of the vivo X5Max the two clusters of Cortex-A53 cores are clocked at 1.5GHz and 1.0GHz for power and efficiency respectively. There are 2GB of RAM on board, when we're seeing a gradual move towards 3GB even in the midrange, though the real-life benefits of this are still debatable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already had the opportunity to test a bunch of similarly equipped devices and had a general idea what to expect. We have picked out the more-popular of those and it turns out implementing and utilizing the said Qualcomm chipset is still a challenge for a lot of vendors. Results vary greatly, but a lot of that can also be attributed to custom OS overlays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a broader comparison we have also thrown in a few devices that you can pick up for around the same price as the vivo - the LG G3, HTC One E9+, Samsung Galaxy E7 and the Asus Zenfone 2. Others like the Huawei P8 are simply there because of their stylish exterior and design - a major selling point for the vivo X5Max.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, we have the raw CPU performance test with GeekBench 3, which should be straight-forward enough. The eight Cortex-A53 cores inside the MSM8939 are by no means a bit-churning powerhouse, but have definitely proven themselves more than adequate in a lot of current devices. Yet, the Vivo X5Max doesn't seem to utilize them to their full capacity. As far as raw calculation goes, the handset falls behind most similarly equipped devices. Like we said, most of the performance drop can be attributed to poor software optimization and the custom OS. Still, we can see that ZTE has managed to do even worse with the Blade S6, powered by the same chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. Here, the vivo X5Max has held up quite a bit better. We can see it sitting comfortably between the recent Oppo devices - the R7 and R5, which is quite respectable, especially considering that the former is noticeably pricier than the vivo. Also, the AnTuTu scores do tend to paint a more-accurate "real-life" performance picture and we really can't complain from how the X5Max behaves under regular everyday use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark, that for some reason the vivo X5Max doesn't seem to get along too well with. We see a really underwhelming overall performance score, with as much as 200 points of difference between the vivo and the Xperia M4 aqua. Even more worrying is that the handset barely surpasses the Galaxy E7, which is based on the Snapdragon 410 SoC. The detailed single-core and multi-core score only furthers this general vibe of underwhelming performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things look slightly better in the graphics department. The Snapdragon 615 comes with an Adreno 405 GPU. Again, we don't expect groundbreaking pixel-pushing from the mid-range chip, but it does fairly well. It is encouraging to see that frame rates are roughly identical across the array of devices, powered by the said SoC. There are, however, a few notable exceptions line the Xiaomi Mi 4i which has managed to squeeze about half a frame extra of the same silicon, but that is well within the margin of error. And if you are wondering why the onscreen charts seem to be topped by The HTC Desire 820 and the Xperia M4 Aqua, the explanation is simple - half the screen resolution at 720p.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as browsing performance goes, the vivo X5Max does fairly well, as long as you stay away from the stock browser. Chrome does come bundled, so really there is no reason to even consider vivo's solution, which offers almost intolerably low performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the vivo X5Max seems to be more of a charmer than a heavy-duty worker. Don't get us wrong, the Snapdragon 615 and Adreno 405 combo is plenty to get you through any everyday task. However, if you are looking to squeeze the most out of the mid-range platform you are paying for, there are definitely other manufacturers who have done a better job of integrating the silicon. Still, if it is looks you are after, it is hard to beat the attractive exterior that vivo has crafted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook app on the vivo X5Max is called Contacts and follows the general styling of the rest of the interface, meaning it's entirely custom. There are tabs, but unless you are big on groups, or want to jump to the dialer or to your personal info page all the time, chances are you won't be using them too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main interface is a well-organized list, with favorite contacts at the top, followed by an alphabetical run-down of the rest. Naturally, there is a search field, which accepts both names and numbers, as well as a vertical slider, along the letters to the right, for quick navigation. There are no contact pics on this screen though, with vivo opting to fit more but thinner rows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new contact is a pretty straightforward process. It begins by selecting where you would like to store the entry, or you can just set a default the first time you use it. The rest is fairly self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact is done through a clean and well-arranged interface. All in all vivo has tried to keep things as simple and intuitive as possible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default telephone app in the vivo X5Max is in keeping with the overall style, just like the contacts. In fact, they almost look like they are both part of the same application, especially thanks to the pretty sliding transition effect between them. But they are very much separate, despite being linked to one another through a quick shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The intuitive contact searching system is implemented here as well. You can start typing a number or a name and the phone will find the contact you are looking for. In-call options are mostly standard, with the exception of the notes option, which is quite handy when you want to write something down during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The X5Max call quality is top-notch. Sound was nice and clear on both ends and the phone held on to signal well. The noise cancellation system works effectively to provide good background noise suppression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker volume of the X5Max isn't very high. In out tests, it scored below average, much like the vivo Xshot before it. The sound isn't particularly loud, but in terms of quality, it is excellent. That won't help you much in noisy environments though, so keep an eye out for notifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Aside from the ever-present Google Hangouts, you also get vivo's own messaging app. It unifies SMS and MMS functionality in one place, which has pretty much become the norm with modern devices. The app does offer the option to import old messages, which is a rare thing to see and can definitely be useful. Messages can be restored from either a cloud service or simply from local storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To handle emails the X5Max offers Gmail preloaded, obviously, as well as a dedicated email app. This is kind of redundant, seeing how the latest version of Google's mail client can now work with any mail account, Google or not, and is now the only email client you will need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you enjoy the consistency of using all Funtouch apps though, the built-in email client can work with web POP3 accounts alike. A button to start a new message sits at the top right of the app. The composition screen holds no surprises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of text input, the vivo X5Max comes with a custom keyboard solution, courtesy of Swype. Like the name suggests, it does support swipe typing and looks and behaves quite nicely. It also offers a lot of options, like a personalized dictionary, theme support and quite a few gestures for accessing various features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is called Album<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max comes with a simple gallery, but it doesn't leave you wanting for features. Launching the app brings you to a timeline interface of your photos and if you don't fancy this, you can easily switch to a folder-browsing mode. There are also albums, which the user can organize. More albums can easily be created, but the cover selection is quite limited and there is no apparent way to create or download new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a single image offers the usual basic options like cropping and rotation as well as a quick shortcut for sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max allows you to edit photos straight from the gallery. The editor itself is packed with features, ranging from trivial cropping and effects all the way up to fine-tuning colors, shadows, exposure and applying different blurs. It is definitely more than enough for quickly fixing up a photo before uploading it online.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max comes with a dedicated video application. It offers a quite basic interface and few advanced features, but definitely gets the job done. The player itself does offer Hi-Fi support as well as DLNA and subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as format support goes, the X5Max didn't have any issues with playing every video we threw at it, be it DivX, XviD, MOV, WMV, MP4, MKV, including files with the typically problematic AC3 sound. It also has good support for subtitles, though not actual option for customizing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting feature is the pop-out mode. It spawns a small draggable video window on top of the UI, but you can't resize it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nice audio player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player, bundled with Funtouch OS and interestingly named iMusic, doesn't look overly impressive but is quite pleasant to use and has a few tricks hidden away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Launching the app brings you to a selection of quite a few browsing options. Songs can be browsed in various categories and playlists are easily accessible, for even more flexibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main playback interface consists of a backdrop of album art and a simple control pad. You get two toggles altogether, one for Repeat/Shuffle and another for switching on Hi-Fi mode, but it only works with headphones attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vivo has thrown another little treat in the music application. It is a simple timer, but one that is tied to your music player. With it, you can easily fall asleep to your favorite jams, without worrying about draining your battery overnight. It can even power-down the device completely, once the deadline is reached.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Vivo X5Max turned out an amazingly talented musician, acing our audio quality test. The smartphone combined perfect scores with the loudest output around when used with an active external amplifier and really got a flying start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones didn't drop the loudness either - the X5Max still remained as loud as we've seen. A miniscule amount of stereo crosstalk crept in and an undetectable amount of intermodulation distortion, but the quality is still very much spotless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An impressive showing by the slim Vivo champion indeed and one every handset on the market, let alone its price range, would be proud off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP camera delivers good output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera on the vivo X5Max uses a 13MP sensor behind an f/2.0 lens. The maximum resolution it can shoot is 4,160 x 3,120 pixels in a 4:3 native aspect ratio. It has a single-LED flash and no extra features like OIS or phase detection autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app uses a combined interface for stills and video, which brings the common issue of different coverage between the two, so you can't properly frame your video until you actually hit record. Other than that it's a clean interface with only the absolute basics displayed at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the usual shooting modes like HDR, Panorama and Night. In terms of settings you're pretty limited, and for example you can only set a 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio, but not different resolutions for each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo enthusiasts will be pleased to find a Pro mode, evoked with an inward swipe of the shutter release button. This gives you access to a lot of manual controls, including exposure compensation (in 1/3 increments), ISO sensitivity (all the way up to ISO1600), shutter speed (as long as 32s), white balance presets and manual focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a number of grid and spiral overlays to assist you with framing, and if that's not enough, you also get a digital level. These are only available in the Pro mode though, which is a shooting mode itself. What that means is you can forget about shooting HDR, for example, with the level or grids on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max creates good images overall, with a lot of detail, but also plenty of noise, readily visible in patches of uniform color. We're especially fond of the mountain slope in the fifth sample, where there's noise, yes, but also some fine texture, where what other cameras produce is closer to a solid blob of dark green.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photos can use a bit of sharpening in post processing as they tend to be a bit soft out of the camera. The colors are spot-on outdoors, but interestingly the reds in our lab shots were rendered slightly towards orange, though it's nothing to worry about. Auto-exposure is dependable and produces consistent results, but dynamic range is not particularly wide and difficult high-contrast scenes often have their shadows pitch-black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode aims to help with that, and does an okay job of lighting up the shadows. The effect is not overly dramatic, and if you don't have the non-HDR image to compare, you may be fooled that it's a regular shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of detail is mostly the same, but if you don't hold still during the multiple exposures, you may end up with misaligned images every now and then. Another thing to note is the halos that form around areas of high contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Panorama output of the X5Max is nothing spectacular. When shot in portrait, the images are about 1,800 pixels tall and a 150-degree shot results in a little over 8 megapixels. Stitching is alright, with the obvious exception of moving objects and ones close by. The exposure is even across the frame, but the level of detail is underwhelming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The close-up shooting capabilities of the X5Max are quite good. It fills the frame nicely with the subject from fairly close distance. We found you need to be careful though, as it would often lead you to believe it's focused properly, while subsequent inspection on a computer screen proves that not to be the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front camera on the vivo X5Max is a 5MP unit, which shoots images in 2,560 x 1,920 pixel resolution. Its output is decent, but it's not on par with the primary shooter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max shoots standard-issue video up to 1080p/30fps as well as slow motion and high-speed videos. The slow motion recording is limited to VGA resolution and ends up grossly underexposed and downright unusable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p mode creates videos with a bitrate of 16Mbps, and audio is recorded at 96Kbps. Unfortunately, the video quality doesn't hold up well to scrutiny and the level of detail is not what you'd expect from its FullHD title. Dynamic range is limited, and the auto-exposure does tend to readjust unnecessarily on occasion, though the focusing mechanism doesn't hunt frequently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast motion mode is called Fast video and shoots at the full 1080p resolution at four times the speed. The speed aside, its qualities are very much the same as the regular speed mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we've provided an untouched sample, shot at 1080p@30fps (00:17min, 33MB) for download from our server.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max comes with Google Chrome as well as a custom browser. Its interface definitely looks nice, and like everything else in Funtouch, fits well into the general design outline. The tab selection interface is similar to a desktop browser and eats away screen estate, so it's great that it can be hidden with a toggle in the bottom right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned in the battery section, the main disadvantage of the vivo browser has to be its inefficiency, and that really makes it a distant second choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thankfully vivo has included Google Chrome in the mix. It is becoming the most popular mobile browser and should be fairly familiar. Thanks to your Google account, Chrome can sync the tabs you have open on other devices (desktops, tablets) with the phone. This feature also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites and can remember passwords and login data across different platforms.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Vivo has kept things pretty clean in terms of preloaded applications and, besides the nowadays obligatory Google suite, there is quite little preloaded software. Also, the things that are included in the mix are generally well executed, nicely styled and even, quite convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up, Funtouch OS has an amazing central management hub, called iManager. It is designed to keep your phone in top shape and generally does a pretty good job of it. It can clean your RAM and storage on request and naturally manage applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the software goes beyond this and is quite clever. For one, it has access to some advanced hardware features on the X5Max and can influence general performance and power-management through different modes. It also offers black-lists for both calls and messages and can even protect you from pesky applications. Once it detects that a certain app is requesting a permission it dubs kind of intrusive, it warns you with a popup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Max comes with WPS Office (Previously Kingsoft Office) preinstalled. It's a pretty powerful office editor, though the included version is the one prior to the major interface redesign. The app can handle Word docs, PDFs, Spreadsheets and Presentations. It can link to cloud storage, email files, and create a shared view with other users and more. There's editing enabled, too, so you can get some work done on the go, if need be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the other bundled apps have nothing really spectacular to offer, except, perhaps, slick looks. The calendar is straightforward. It can seamlessly sync with your google account and naturally has events, reminders and all of the standard week, month and daily views, but also a year view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we find that vivo has created a quite feature-rich notes app. Entries can contain multimedia, as well as reminders, which get automatically entered into your calendar. The app even lets you doodle on screen for a quick note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other things that deserve an honorable mention are the sound recorder and the calculator, which has a nice scientific view in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a very intuitive file manager. It automatically groups things according to type, but also allows traditional folder browsing, as well as searching. What it lacks is multiple file actions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The third slimmest smartphone in existence, the vivo X5Max turns out to be a multidimensional performer. Sure, its claim to fame lies in its upmarket design, which we need to be really picky to find fault with. The execution is top-notch as well, and the smartphone is working hard to justify its price tag, though of course you need to be willing to accept the premise that style and build are worth a premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Believe it or not, this nearly paper-thin smartphone excels in battery life, of all areas. If you steer clear of the proprietary browser, you're in for a pleasant surprise in terms of uptime. An endurance rating around the 70-hour mark is the summary of a balanced performance in all areas, both active on-screen time and standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.5-inch FullHD Super AMOLED is another excellent performer scoring high in the brightness department, for a Super AMOLED that is. It's sharp, has lively colors and only exhibits a slight green tint when viewed from an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Funtouch OS is perhaps a little controversial. Some will embrace the fresh-looking Android skin with its customization options and nifty gesture controls. Others won't be able to get over how disorganized it is and the strong iOS influence will certainly bother Android purists. It may also be hard to swallow the fact that you're buying into a year-old OS release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Granted, hardware performance isn't the X5Max' strong suit. Vivo apparently held back a little when tweaking the chipset and that may have something to do with the great battery numbers, but we don't see much fault with such a bias, certainly not in the case of the X5Max.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera creates images with a lot of detail, but also plenty of noise, though we appreciate the conservative approach to noise-suppression. True-to-life colors and dependable exposure round up a good overall experience in terms of stills, while 1080p videos are decent at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo R5 is among the most obvious rivals of the vivo X5Max. Fractions of a millimeter are for bragging rights only, and where it matters, the smaller-screened 5.2-inch R5 loses by a country mile - for every full battery charge on the X5Max you'll need to do two on the R5, and no fast charging tech will offset that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Oppo R7, a more balanced offering where battery endurance is not such a limiting factor. You'd be sacrificing even more screen real estate here, as the R7 is only 5.0 inches in diagonal. We'd be hard-pressed to pick the best of these three in terms of build and finish, but there's something about the 2.5D glass of the R7, which may tip the scales in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A7 has a marginally smaller footprint, and at 6.3mm is not exactly thick either. It's also substantially lighter and has a slightly better battery life, even on top of the already excellent X5Max. The Galaxy A7 has already gotten the Lollipop update, while the X5Max may never live to see one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex2 is being heavily discounted in many parts of the world, despite the fact that it's rocking proper flagship hardware. You could easily snatch one for even less than the X5Max, and the dramatically curved 5.5-incher has a lot of appeal for the style-conscious too. The G Flex2 has a superior OIS camera, laser autofocus and 2160p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX4 Pro is worth a look as well. Yes, it's roughly twice as thick, but it's cheaper, its 5.5-inch display has QHD resolution, its camera can shoot 4K video, and it will significantly outlast the X5Max if you're mostly into web browsing. It also has a fingerprint sensor. But did you go on reading after we said twice as thick? The newly released MX5 is in the picture too, and it's thinner, while retaining most of its predecessor's virtues, save for the QHD resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Older flagships are also within reach of the buyer ready to pay the vivo X5Max' asking price. The Sony Xperia Z2 is one that comes to mind. Although two-generations-old already, the Z2 can easily outperform the X5Max, and has environmental sealing and better battery backup. It does have a smaller screen though, and is just another mainstream device, unlike the X5Max.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a lot to like about the vivo X5Max, in fact it must be one of the more pleasant surprises recently. It can't outgrow the limitations of its chipset paired with less than perfectly optimized software, and Funtouch has a long road to maturity. But it has a beautiful display, it shoots fine images and scores high in the most unexpected area, battery life. The X5Max is another fine phone to help overcome prejudice against Chinese designs but also one that argues premium looks do not necessarily imply usability compromises.</paragraph>
