			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Mini phones are hot and HTC don?t want you take Sony Ericsson?s word on that. What started as a small niche is now a segment that keeps growing ? and one that no manufacturer can afford to ignore. Sony Ericsson have just announced their updated mini lineup while Samsung and LG routinely have more than one thing going on in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC know they can?t afford to stop right in the middle of what they?ve been doing with the Wildfire, the Aria and the Gratia. Going all the way back to the Tattoo, which first put Android on the radar for budget shoppers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s plenty of choice already for those who like their droid in a small package. The HTC Wildfire S seems to be aware of that and does well to make itself seen. The lively paintjobs and friendly compact size are the right features to show to potential buyers. The Wildfire S has found a way to further reduce size while keeping the same 3.2? screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we should keep in mind though. HTC seem to be in power-saving mode currently with all their recent releases but facelifts offering minor improvements over predecessors. That holds true for the Wildfire S too, though this is not to say that it shouldn?t be on your list if you?re looking for the next hot mini. HTC seem to have worked exactly on the things that most needed improvement. Display is key here, HVGA finally bringing it to acceptable levels. CIF video-capture was upped to VGA and the phone runs the latest Android Gingerbread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These things should give it enough value as an upgrade. The Wildfire S is well-designed and well-built ? a colorful little droid to offer good bang for buck. Let?s look at what else the S stands for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wildfire S is the usual all-round smartphone ? with the latest Android inside at that ? but now in an even friendlier shape. All work and no play wouldn?t do for the Wildfire S and HTC have added some twists to the old recipe to make it 2011-ready.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Balance was sought above all ? no groundbreaking features are to be expected. Not in this price range, not in a pint-sized package. Minis are friendly and playful. Let?s see if the HTC Wildfire S matches the description.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Economical retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tiny box of the HTC Wildfire S has the essentials duly covered. You get the mandatory charger and an USB cable (to use with the charger as well as in data connections). There?s a set of nice looking headphones and a complimentary 2GB microSD card inside too. The rest is the usual papers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white set of accessories is suspiciously similar to the iPhone?s, the earphones especially almost a complete replica.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Wildfire S 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S measures 101.3 x 59.4 x 12.4 mm and is smaller in real life than it appears on a picture. It?s made entirely of plastic, tipping the scales at the acceptable 105 grams. Maybe it?s the similar styling but we got it wrong initially. No aluminum unibody in the HTC Wildfire S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone feels great in your hand and ? being so small, one-hand operation is hassle-free. 3.2? is still more than enough screen real estate to work with ? you don?t feel crammed for space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S borrows some styling ideas from its bigger brother the Desire S and has inherited others from the original Wildfire. Bottom line, the Wildfire S is neat and friendly, and delightfully compact. The finish hasn?t suffered from the plastic build. The soft rubbery back contrasts nicely with the brushed finish of the front frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone will be available in a variety of colors and the selection makes sense for a phone targeted at the young. Size is still the key selling point though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Wildfire S is dominated by a 3.2? capacitive touchscreen of HVGA (320x480) resolution. It?s a reasonably bright LCD unit but with no automatic adjustment for the lack of an ambient light sensor - our unit is a pre-release one and doesn't offer it. The final market-ready unit will have this covered. The smallish screen is quite reflective ? making it uncomfortable to use outdoors. The poor viewing angles don?t help it either: colors quickly get washed out. Still it?s enough of an improvement over the poor QVGA screen of the original Wildfire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you have every right to expect, the capacitive screen response is top-notch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the device you get the usual four capacitive keys: Home, Menu, Back and Search. The major absence compared to the original Wildfire is the optical trackpad. It won?t be badly miss we guess ? except perhaps in text editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive keys are small but well-spaced, with precise vibration feedback for comfortable use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the Wildfire S you?ll find the volume rocker and the MicroUSB port for charging/data connections. The volume control is unexpectedly big and prominent, with good press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?re no controls on the right, the asymmetrical contour of the battery cover a nice little accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the device there is a standard 3.5mm headphone jack and the power/lock button. It?s easy to locate by touch and bounces right back up after each press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mouthpiece and a tiny lanyard eyelet are the only things to note at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the device is simple but attractive. We like the soft matt finish and the light-colored patch holding the loudspeaker grill, camera lens and LED flash that stands out against the darker finish of the surrounding surface. The camera is a 5 MP auto-focus unit and the LED flash looks quite powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 1230 MAh Li-Ion battery. It?s quoted at 360-570 hours of stand-by and 430/350 minutes of talk time (between 2G and 3G). In reality our unit gave us about 5 days, used sparingly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S is a solid little mini whose key feature is its diminutive size. The premium feel is gone but getting a higher-res HVGA screen we?d call it a fair trade. And just to be clear, the phone has no aluminum unibody but the build and finish are up to the usual high HTC standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a small phone that handles well and comes in a variety of colors to please any taste. Friendly and compact, the Wildfire S will let even less experienced users enjoy Android.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense UI, Gingerbread on an HVGA display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wildfire S runs Android v2.3 out of the box. As usual, it is skinned with the HTC Sense UI, but it?s a slightly updated version. There are two major improvements over past editions: a Quick Settings tab in the Notification area and a revamped Main Menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the surface, the HTC Sense is familiar enough, with some welcome refinements under the hood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a video demonstration of the HTC Wildfire S user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen, there are three virtual keys and a scrollbar. The left key launches the main menu. The middle key is a shortcut to the Phone app and the right key brings up the "Personalize" menu. The latter contains various customization options for the display, homescreen and sound notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The scrollbar at the bottom is just an indication of which homescreen pane you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s Leap view instead - tap the home key (while on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. With a press and hold you can rearrange the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreen panes is all you get though ? there?s no add or delete option. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense makes use of Scenes ? essentially five custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, Play and default). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the widgets on the homescreen. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes (older Sense versions prompted you to save modifications as a new scene) and you can get more scenes at the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but sure allows wide customization ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. They also come with unique wallpaper and can set different colors to various UI elements. They can also replace the standard dock, lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the Wildfire S comes only with one skin pre-installed, but you can always get more from the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has the typical grid layout, but you can switch to a list. In the list layout, there?s two-finger alphabet scrolling, which makes locating apps faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has been updated with the tabbed layout available in different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? all apps, frequent apps and favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of things to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are thirteen different clocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Friend Stream widget for instance shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet/update status. The other version is more compact and only allows status updates and tweets. A third one is also available showing only your friends? status updates with no option to update yours. There's nothing stopping you from using all of them, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is divided into two tabs. The first one features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. A press and hold on the Home button works too. The second tab accommodates switches for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, cellular data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection is available almost everywhere. The Gingerbread implementation involves two large pointers either side of the marked text. You can drag each of those easily to make the selection you need. Then you have Copy/Cut/Paste/Quick Lookup options. It really doesn?t get much simpler than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S has decent performance although a bit low by today?s standards. Despite it runs on Android 2.3 Gingerbread, the Wildfire S is based on the same hardware as its predecessor and even requires more power juice because of the higher resolution display. So there is some lag here and there, but nothing to ruin the overall good experience. But if you are lag-intolerant at all then you should definitely pass this fella and jump on a more powerful phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast boot feature is enabled in the HTC Wildfire S but it won?t work if you have removed the battery ? in that case it will do a regular slow boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool things is apps preserve their state after the restart ? so if you were browsing a web site before shutting the down phone, the browser will restore your session.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our guess is, HTC has used some sort of Suspend or Hibernate logic as we know them from regular computers to implement the fast boot.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sensed phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wildfire S has HTC?s all-knowing phonebook with deep social networking integration. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just the first tab ? the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages received from the contact ? it would have been a lot more useful if it used conversation style view, but for that you?d have to go to the full-featured Messaging app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab holds a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs are what turns the Wildfire S into a powerful networking tool. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed too and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re switching from another phone don?t worry ? you don?t even need a computer to pull your contacts, messages and calendar items from the old phone into your new Wildfire S. The Transfer Data app supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an old trick (Symbian-powered Nokias have been doing this for ever) and most people would probably go with syncing the contacts over the cloud, but still it?s a handy tool to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony with smart dial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). The HTC Wildfire S has both Smart Dialing and Voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wildfire S knows three accelerometer-based tricks ? turning the phone over will mute the ringer of an incoming call or placing it down can activate the loudspeaker automatically when you are in the middle of a call. The other feature is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another very handy feature is that when someone calls, their latest Tweet or Facebook update will show up ? possibly reminding you what the caller has been up to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC Wildfire S fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored a Good mark putting it somewhere in the middle among its competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Wildfire S are capable of handling all sorts of text messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered ? the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. ?drx? matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is bigger and covers nearly half of the screen in landscape mode. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text input method that the Wildfire S offers is an on-screen QWERTY. While it?s still not as good as a hardware one, it?s the next best thing ? the 3.2? screen has enough real estate for big, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit. The HTC software keyboard is excellent too. Going landscape makes the keys and their spacing even larger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hassle-free emails<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S comes with two email apps ? the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app features the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app features several tabs that let you filter the inbox: you can opt to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or invitations. You can mark emails too ? they will show up in the marked mail tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversation view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. When you add multiple accounts, you can view each inbox individually or go into the All accounts section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is possible (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC Wildfire S lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery also applies for the Sense treatment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery has the usual list-with-thumbnail structure. The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each sub-album has a thumbnail of the latest image. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the main album there are three virtual buttons ? one for the actual folder list, another for Facebook and, one for Flickr. These two display images from either account or those posted by your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo on the HTC Wildfire S is very easy ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the HTC Wildfire S image folders you can choose between grid and filmstrip layout (flip the phone horizontally and the accelerometer will take care of the rest). You are also able to mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t copy/paste images from folder to folder either ? you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Wildfire S supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does XviD but has some limitations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the All videos subfolder in the Gallery or from the Videos shortcut in the menu, they launch the same thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files can be viewed as a grid or filmstrip and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface on the HTC Wildfire S offers a full screen toggle (stretch / crop video to fit the screen) and you can scrub through the video too. There are no subtitle, DLNA and SRS support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does OK in general - WVGA MP4 videos were no problem. The player handled all of the XviD videos up to VGA resolution (and few WVGA). Most of the DivX files didn?t though. MKV files are a no-go too. Given the resolution and the hardware we think the Wildfire S gives you the best it is capable of.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs and Playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs or go back. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. From the context menu, you can share a song (over Bluetooth, email or message) and you can set it as a ringtone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Wildfire S is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that annoyed us about the radio is that it takes quite a while to start and stop ? about five seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Passable audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S will hardly set the world alight with its audio output, but it's not too bad for a low-end handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an external amplifier the achieved results are pretty good, except for the intermodulation distortion, which is a bit high for that scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance is similar when headphones are connected - intermodulation distortion rises a bit higher, but the rest of the readings are more than the price tag could demand. We are especially impressed by the stereo-crosstalk reading, which is one of the highest we have seen (with headphones plugged in, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, volume levels on both occasions are pretty low so the Wildfire S will probably not be the audiophile's favorite. It might do a pretty solid job for you if you are not too pretentious though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Poor 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S packs a 5MP camera for stills of up to 2592x1952 pixel resolution. The phone does VGA videos @ 24fps too. There?s a single-LED flash, which can also be used as video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very space efficient. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder, with the virtual shutter in the center. There?s a virtual zoom slider on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S features touch focus and face detection; geotagging is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus lets the camera focus as you reframe ? quite useful given the Wildfire S doesn?t have a proper shutter key and you can?t do that with the virtual shutter key either. The camera supports face detection too, which also can be enabled in self-portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is not as good as you can expect from a 5MP camera. The color rendering is fine, but the contrast need some further tuning. The noise levels are kept low, but the amount of resolved detail is really disappointing ? it?s the biggest issue of its camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check out the camera samples below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 5MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Wildfire S in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see for yourself the Wildfire S camera falls behind most of its competitors and will surely not satisfy the average user. As we said above the biggest problem we met is the unsatisfactory captured detail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor VGA videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but only before you start shooting ? then the focus is locked and won?t change even if you get closer or move back. Still, the Wildfire S had no problems focusing at even very close distances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in 3GP format and the result is pretty much the same as the still shots ? poor amount of captured detail and some contrast issues. There are also some duplicated frames, but that?s hardly noticeable on the poor quality videos. Once again HTC has proved to us it is not in the camera business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes an untouched VGA@24fps video clip (4MB).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S has a complete connectivity set. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and dual-band 3G: 7.2Mbps downlink and 384kbps uplink thanks to HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n but there is no DLNA support. The Bluetooth version is 3.0, but you should not expect high-speed transfers either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you plug in the microUSB cable you?re presented with a long list of options - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use the phone as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses the computers Internet connection).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support 1 to 8 devices (default Froyo app maxes out at 5), you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable only ?allowed users? to connect or leave it open for anything (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good web browsing, but Flash is a no-go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S has the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread web browser. There are some performance improvements over Froyo, but the Wildfire S can?t take advantage of the full Flash support (not supported processor). There is Flash Lite instead, so you can interact with some banners and other basic Flash content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are back and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out yet more options ? anything from finding on page and text selection (which works just like in the messaging app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wildfire S browser also supports pinch/double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes it extremely easy to read even longer texts on the phone display. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history. Tabs are displayed as 3D cards too ? a really neat trick is that if you pinch zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level you go straight into the tab selector. This may be a cool way to manage tabs but too many of them open at once will seriously slow down the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S comes only with Flash Lite support so Flash videos and games are a no-go. As we already mentioned above you can only see some banners and other similar Flash basic content. Interesting enough you can play embedded YouTube videos right within the browser (such as our UI demo videos). We have no real explanation for that, may be the Flash Lite plugin somehow converts them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could always use the YouTube app though, which partially compensate for the lack of Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, the Android 2.3 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer misses a document viewer app<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Desk clock app turns your Wildfire S into a? well, Desk clock. It displays the current time and date and allows you to switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World clock app lets you quickly check the time in different time zones, while the stopwatch and timer apps might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Facebook and Twitter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which let you post on the world?s largest social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Facebook app is available, which enables things like Facebook Chat (yet another way to talk to your friends) and Facebook Places (which lets you to check into places, like Foursquare).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is only one Twitter app that comes preinstalled on the Wildfire S ? HTC?s Peep. No worries though, it does very good job, but in case you don?t like it, you can always download another app from the Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more app worth mentioning - the search app Quick lookup. It lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatter for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market, HTC Hub and HTC Likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.), so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying all apps in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make finding apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to look for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Market items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market, but each one comes with an HTC review. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your Wildfire S contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (if you?ve lost it in your room and can?t find it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose SMS and MMS messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the Wildfire S in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy but if you?re using an updated browser you should be fine. However, HTCSense.com failed to load properly in Internet Explorer 9 but it worked once we enabled Compatibility Mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Navigate the Google way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in a minute and 40 seconds (with A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Navigation is also on board and can do voice-guidance for free. Availability is still limited though, and it relies on Internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually, but you?ll need a co-pilot to read you the instructions for that one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The whole S lineup by HTC is under clear instructions not to be too generous with the upgrades. The Wildfire S takes that almost literally but isn?t afraid to smuggle in something that?s actually worth it. In our case here, the screen is the major beneficiary: it retains the 3.2? diagonal but gets a welcome boost to HVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the record, processor speed (from 528MHz to 600MHz) and RAM (from 384MB to 512MB) have also been upgraded, but not enough perhaps to make much difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s stay focused though on the most important thing about the Wildfire S. It?s (hopefully) an inexpensive droid that offers some premium goodies. You get an excellent build and the latest Android 2.3. Sense is a great skin to have and so are some of the custom HTC features (the HTC Hub and HTCSense.com integration).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a variety of available colors, it will be easy for the new Wildfire S to connect to its young audience. Not least, it?s among the few smartphones that can be attractive to the ladies too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another point in favor is that the major competition is still to be released. The good news is the Wildfire S has still a few months to enjoy before the new 1GHz, Gingerbread-powered and HD video enabled Xperia minis start to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson Xperia mini ? Sony Ericsson Xperia mini pro</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the meantime, there?re cheaper and no less powerful droids to worry about. The Samsung Galaxy Ace might be just what you need ? except that it?s not actually a mini phone. The similarly priced Ace offers a 3.5? HVGA display, an 800MHz processor, a 5 megapixel camera and lots of connectivity goodies. It is currently running Froyo by default, but Gingerbread is already in the air.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus One and the Samsung Galaxy Gio are options to consider too. The Optimus One offers similar processing power as the Wildfire S, while the Galaxy Gio boasts better CPU. Both of them have 3 megapixel still camera though and the level of customization isn?t even remotely comparable to HTC Sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KP Optimus One ? Samsung Galaxy Gio S5660</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Facebook-centric Salsa, which we met at this year?s MWC, is a fellow member of the new generation HTC midrangers. The main differences are the level of Facebook integration and the bigger 3.4? screen on the HTC Salsa. It?s yet to be officially launched though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Salsa</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no question HTC needed to update their lower midrange lineup. Maybe they could?ve done better than the Wildfire S and probably they?re already working on it. Meanwhile, they?re ready to give a good enough deal to users who don?t necessarily need to squeeze every last drop of speed and performance out of their phone. The Wildfire S is a charming little handset that will rather be friends with than try to impress its potential users.</paragraph>
