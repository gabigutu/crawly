			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson is back at it and they are pushing pedal to the metal with their latest unusually curved and unusually streamlined sports car ? the XPERIA Arc. Once one of the top three phone manufacturers, Sony Ericsson has been through some hard times but the company underwent a painful restructuring and it found a way to make its handsets desirable again by focusing on the high-end segment and staking on Android OS. The XPERIA X10 did a lot to repair the company public image and it?s now up to the Arc to improve it even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In theory it should be easier now ? we already know Sony Ericsson is capable of producing top-notch hardware. Even if they aren?t doing spectacularly in terms of pushing updates, their recent smartphones have all been good value for money so the Arc won?t have its origin held against it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet competition on the high-end has never been more intense so a significant performance boost would be required from the Arc even if it was only to retain the same position as the X10 last year. Fortunately it might just manage to deliver, or at least as far as it specs sheet suggests:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The lack of multi-touch input and the less RAM than most competitors were the sticks that were most frequently used for beating the X10. The XPERIA Arc not only fixes those, but expands the screen size and introduces the new Bravia engine for even better image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The waistline has also been slimmed down and the new interestingly curved design adds another touch of class to the Arc. Now add the microHDMI port and the same capable camera as on the X10 and you get the idea that the Arc is a powerful beast indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, with high hopes and eagerness we are stepping into the hardware part of this preview. Join us after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 125 x 63 x 8.7 mm the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc is about as big as you could expect from a device with a 4.2-inch screen. The bezel on top is a bit wider than some competitors but the difference is hardly notable, when you look at it in isolation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to warn you though, that the 8.7mm thickness that Sony Ericsson is so keen to advertise is measured at the center ? the Arc?s slimmest part. The curved handset is more than a millimeter thicker at the top and bottom edges where we measured a thickness of 10mm. Now that?s pretty slim for any smartphone and it certainly gives that high-tech vibe that we appreciate so much ? it?s just that you shouldn?t fall for the misleading ad materials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc is a pretty light device with its 117 grams. We are more into the solid feel that heavier devices leave, but if you don?t like carrying too heavy devices in your pocket, you will certainly appreciate the Sony Ericsson approach. The Samsung Galaxy S benefitted from much the same pocketability and not many people are complaining.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 certainly wasn?t coyote ugly, but placed next to the Arc it?s definitely looking outdated. The slimmer body and glossier plastics make the new handset a real looker and the gradient used for the back plate coloring is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now there are some downsides to this design too ? the glossy plastic is rather easy to cover with fingerprints and there is no metal used for the body. Yet we?d call the overall result pretty pleasing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The display is a step forward<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front is almost entirely taken by the 4.2? 16M color LCD screen of FWVGA resolution (854 x 480 pixels). It uses capacitive technology for its touchscreen so as you could imagine there were no issues with its sensitivity. As we already mentioned this time multi-touch input is enabled too so as far as touch control is concerned, there?s nothing to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dubbed Reality display, the most interesting thing about the the Arc?s screen, is its Sony Bravia Mobile Engine, which is expected to improve the image quality by increasing contrast and sharpness. We were pleased to find out that it?s actually doing a good job, rather than just being another fancy term to place on a press release. You have to keep in mind that this only works with photos and videos, but after all it?s where it matters most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact when looked at it from the best angle the XPERIA Arc display is certainly among the best screens on the market. It?s got more vibrant reds and greens than the iPhone 4 Retina display and in case you aren?t into much saturation you will probably prefer it over the Samsung SuperAMOLED screens too (though we still find Nokia?s ClearBlack screens to be the champion in color reproduction).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, an LCD unit is unable to match the natural contrast of an AMOLED screen, but given that limitation Sony Ericsson have done an excellent job of things. The difference here is by far not as pronounced as it used to be with the X10 screen and most other LCD units out there. We?d get the Arc Bravia-enabled screen over a Samsung?s Super Clear LCD, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Reality screen does have a problem with its viewing angles. The advantage it holds against competition when looked from the best possible angle quickly disappears as you go wider. The writings of the screen might remain visible but contrast degrades very quickly and colors get vastly distorted. It?s an unpleasant effect that you cannot see with the IPS matrix of the iPhone 4 or the two current best AMOLED technologies (ClearBlack and SuperAMOLED).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get a better idea of what we are talking about check out the following video comparing the XPERIA Arc display to the Galaxy S and iPhone 4 units. Notice how quickly the Arc screen contrast degrades as the viewing angle widens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general we see the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc display as a significant update over its X10 predecessor and all upgraders will certainly be happy with it. Yet, depending on whether you look at your phone from a wide angle often and whether you like a bit of extra saturation, it might fall short from the best on the market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The controls are good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Below the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc display we find the same three keys as on the X10. You get a back button, a home key that brings up recently used apps tab on long press and a menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three keys we mentioned are all wide enough, so even if they are a bit thin, you are unlikely to have any problem with their usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the proximity sensor and the earpiece. According to the Sony Ericsson description there should also be an ambient-light sensor present here, but automatic brightness control of the screen was unavailable on our unit. We'll see if that changes in the final version of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the XPERIA Arc holds the 3.5mm standard audio jack. It?s got no protective cover over it so there?ll be nothing getting in the way when you plug your headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rather small power key and the microHDMI port are on top of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc. Despite its small size the power key is slightly elevated so it?s ok to use. Unfortunately an HDMI cable won?t be supplied in the box (or so the official release shows) so you will need to get one yourselves if you are into sharing your photos and videos to an HDTV. We are yet to see if the handset offers some custom TV-out interface or screen mirroring over HDMI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Arc right side hosts the microUSB port, which is again unprotected, the LED status light, the rather thin volume rocker and the miniscule camera key. Now considering the shooting powers of the XPERIA Arc we would have definitely preferred a larger key that doesn?t need getting used to, but we are not going to take too many point of the XPERIA Arc here. After all most of the handsets direct competitors don?t even have a camera key (think iPhone 4, Desire HD, Galaxy S, etc).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we are more concerned about is the location of the 8 megapixel camera lens on the back. Too close to the edge it is extremely likely to get covered by a finger when holding the handset naturally. You have to be extremely careful and only use two fingers on your left hand when shooting if you don?t want to ruin your shots. That?s a common problem for the iPhone4 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the unfortunately non-hot-swappable microSD slot, the SIM slot and the second microphone pinhole, used for active noise cancelation. The battery capacity is 1500 mAh and it?s said to last for up to 430 hours of stand-by or up to 7 hours of talk time. We?d need to spend some time with a finalized unit to comment on those numbers but so far the pre-release has been doing pretty well, surviving through more than three days of moderate usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In conclusion the general handling of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc is quite good. The handset, large as it may be, is pretty comfortable to handle and if it wasn?t for the uncomfortable camera lens placement and tiny camera key it would have been closing on perfection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Gingerbread takes over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc brings two important changes to the company smartphones? UI. It debuts the new 2.3 version of Android, called Gingerbread, and it gets rid of the Mediascape interface. We can?t speak for everyone but for us it?s definitely a fair trade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson still has Timescape to make their products distinguishable and axing Mediascape will probably reduce the future Android update delays. That probably makes the XPERIA Arc a more balanced product than the X10 software-wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters we've prepared a short video demo of the XPERIA Arc user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&gt;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first glance it?s not that easy to see the changes brought by Android 2.3 Gingerbread. The new edition brought lots of new APIs and extended the platform gaming capabilities, but the interface elements haven?t been drastically altered. And with Sony Ericsson skinning the whole thing it?s even harder to spot the differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we particularly like is the Overview mode that the Sony Ericsson Arc offers. You pinch zoom out of any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new screen opens up with a cool transition effect. All your widgets gather there and you can click the one you want and go to its screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of functionality it?s similar to the HTC Leap view or what Samsung have on the Galaxy S. However here widgets are not ordered in mini screens so you cannot see what?s on each of them. Instead all widgets are shuffled so they can utilize the space more efficiently and remain as big as possible and thus easier to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next thing we noticed are the four docked shortcuts (two either side of the app drawer key) on the homescreen. Those are visible on all five homescreen panes and can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders is easy and simple, much resembling the pattern on the iOS devices. You get one icon and drag it over the other. A pop-up appears, asking you to select an icon and automatically suggesting a name for the folder when you do it. Of course, you are free to change the name as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are new animations when moving items around the homescreen, sorting them in folders or deleting them. There are no new wallpapers included in Gingerbread, but you can get as many as you want from the Android Market anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon entering the app drawer you will see a new shortcut in the lower left corner. It allows you to pick how your icons should be sorted ? you can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can pick the custom sorting option and go the old-fashioned way by rearranging the icons manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new Sony Ericsson app called LiveWare comes preinstalled on the XPERIA Arc. It allows you to modify the behavior of your handset when an accessory is connected. You can set any app you have installed to automatically launch when headset, headphones or a charger is connected. You can, for example make the Arc start the music player each time you plug-in your headphones or go to picture frame mode each time you connect a charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major change to the user interface also concerns text selection. Gingerbread really takes things to a whole new level by placing two large pointers either side of the marked text. You can then drag each of those easily to make the selection you need. It really doesn?t get much simpler than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as general performance is concerned the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc does splendidly. It?s powered by a Qualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon System-on-a-chip featuring a 1 GHz Scorpion CPU and the Adreno 205 GPU. Yet the further optimizations brought by Gingerbread helps it do a bit better than the Desire HD at the CPU benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it?s not so much synthetic benchmarks that should concern you ? it?s the real life performance that matter here and the XPERIA Arc feels as smooth as butter. Even at these early stages of its development the handset didn?t treat us to any irritating lags or nasty holdups, which is really promising to say the least.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 MP Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Arc camera usability might be damaged a bit by the lens location or the iffy camera key, but it still remains one of the device?s key selling points. An 8 megapixel autofocus snapper is surprisingly rare to see at the top end nowadays, despite the fact that Samsung INNOV8 has been available for more than 2 years now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, no the HTC Desire HD doesn?t count as its image quality doesn?t come quite close to that of the XPERIA Arc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first thing first, the user interface of the Arc camera has been slightly redesigned. You now have a bar with five shortcuts to popular features at the right, a bar with the latest captured images on the left and still camera/camcorder toggle at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The five most comfortable shortcuts allow you to change the capturing mode, resolution, to pick a scene, turn on flash and enable/disable touch capture (i.e. take a shot by pressing the viewfinder).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon pressing the menu key you get some extra customizable options like focus mode, white balance, geo tagging and image stabilization. As is to be expected from a device in this class the XPERIA Arc also packs face detection and smile shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is quite good although the unfavorable weather conditions around our parts still prevent us from passing a final verdict. We can confirm though that there?s plenty of fine detail in the XPERIA Arc shots and the color balance and saturation seems spot-on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise levels aren?t bad, although the applied noise reduction might be a bit too harsh. Still, with a few more months remaining until the Arc is released, we expect the final units to be tuned to produce even better images. Now it won?t come anywhere near the Nokia N8, but it has an excellent chance of getting the silver medal in the smart cameraphone category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo quality comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc in the Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HD video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD video recording is also a really popular feature recently and the XPERIA Arc is doing pretty well (at least specs-wise) with its 30fps. Videos are pretty smooth, although they seem a little low on contrast and fine detail. It?s nothing that a little tuning of the post-processing algorithm cannot fix, we hope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this 720p sample that we captured with the XPERIA Arc. Once again we have to remind you that we used a pre-release unit and that the weather conditions weren't exactly perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively you can download this untouched sample, taken straight from the device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc is a promising smartphone ? it looks sleek, feels smooth and packs a very decent camera. And chances are that it will improve even further before it hits the shelves as there is plenty of time until then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet the high-end smartphone market is becoming more and more overcrowded with each passing day. It?s where most prestige is earned and understandably every company wants to play a key role there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the LG Optimus 2X that puts the dual-core Nvidia Tegra to the table and the Motorola Atrix that will even add 1GB of RAM. The Apple Phone 4 is always in the thereabouts when high-end smartphones are discussed and we are waiting for Samsung to bring in the Galaxy S successor next month at the MWC. That could either be a global version of the AT&amp;T-bound Infuse 4G or (fingers crossed!) something even better. Not to mention the Google Nexus S, which is certain to get speedy Android updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, hot and camera capable as it might be, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc will have a hard time in the market. It will have to pull off an equally impressive performance when we meet again for a full review in a few months if it?s to stay in the fight for the top spot.</paragraph>
