			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you've been paying attention - and we know you have - there's no way you couldn't have noticed that for a good ten days or so we've all been on and on about two phones. Now, we're about to make it three but don't expect anything radically different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No sharp turns ahead, at least for another while. Android is where all the worthwhile action is these days. Just out of a clash with the HTC One, the Samsung Galaxy S4 is about to fight it out with another spotlight-stealer. To be fair, and respectful of chronology, it's the Sony Xperia Z that has been waiting to finally meet its match.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, occasions like this are an invitation to dwell on the inevitable. When two impressive smartphones in the Sony Xperia Z and the Samsung Galaxy S4 are about to cross paths, it's not just a sequence of events - it's fate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But will the Xperia Z meet its nemesis, or is Sony's headstart to the market too much for Samsung to handle? Well, that would be the question on the minds of Samsung and Sony shareholders. We users, on the other hand, should be interested in what each of them has in there "for me"?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S4 over Sony Xperia Z<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z is clearly a smartphone made to not just compete, but to win. The Galaxy S4 builds on a generations known for amazing screen quality, standard-setting performance, the latest version of the OS available and features unseen before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Completely different ideas stand behind the Sony Xperia Z and the Samsung Galaxy S4, but what they have in common is equally important. These two are definitely in the running for best smartphone of the year, and we'll start with what makes them stand apart in terms of design and build.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alright, it's the styling and finish obviously that makes the first and quite important difference between two gadgets, all the more so when you have two smartphones of similar size, equally slim, powered by nearly the same internals and flaunting a five-inch screen each of HD resolution. So yes, the design does set those two apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In this case, apart doesn't even begin to tell the whole story. Both the Xperia Z and the Galaxy S4 are the culmination of decades of engineering experience, design, precision and aesthetics. And while we have no reason to doubt the commitment of either manufacturer to any of those values, it's clear that these Android flagships are based on a different notion of aesthetics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For Sony, this is a first major breakthrough at the highest level, so an exterior matching the technology inside was a must. And the Xperia Z should be no surprise, coming from a company that has consistently demonstrated its design excellence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glass covering the front and back of the handset, the assertively angular styling, the soft rubbery frame that runs around the edges make a perfect ensemble. Undoubtedly, the Xperia Z is very much in the running for the handsomest phone of 2013.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung, on the other hand, is betting on what's proven to work. It would've been way out of its comfort zone if it was to consider anything different than the build and finish that sold by the millions in the shape of Galaxy S III's. We can safely count the earlier two generations as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 is built entirely out of plastic and looks barely different from the Galaxy s III, except for some subtle details, and has the same Hyperglazed finish (basically, a transparent coating over the plastic). The Samsung flagship looks reasonable - better than the Galaxy S III if you ask us - and raises no doubts whatsoever about long term durability. What it clearly lacks is the premium feel of the Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To top that up, the Xperia Z is IP57-certified for dust and water resistance: it'll survive meter-deep dives for as long as 30 minutes. To make sure no water breaks in, all the phone's ports along the edges are covered with plastic flaps. And that includes a memory card slot too. The price to pay though is a non-removable back cover, and therefore a non-user-replaceable battery, which could be a potential deal breaker for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another negative side to Sony's choice of materials - with all that glass, fingerprints are quite the nuisance. Indeed the Xperia Z turns into a greasy mess in no time, which makes it hard to appreciate the brilliant design. Getting it clean isn't too hard though to be honest, and the white version successfully masks fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While certainly not as good-looking, the Galaxy S4 design comes with a number of practical advantages. Not only is it lighter (16 grams), but the removable back cover translates to a user-replaceable battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of bulk, both phones are in the same size category. A 5" display of 1080p resolution is the centerpiece and there isn't much space wasted around it. Still the Galaxy S4 is a couple of millimeters shorter and a millimeter narrower, even though it has physical buttons and the Xperia Z sacrifices some screen real estate to accommodate those. Peculiarly, the Galaxy S4 and the Xperia Z are equally slim at 7.9mm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Screen comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z and Galaxy S4 are built around a 5" screen each of 1080p resolution, which seems to be the flagship standard in 2013. The pixel density is ridiculously high at 441 ppi, which is par for the course, but frankly, even if there were any difference it would've been impossible to spot at over 400ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, this is where the similarities end, as the two phones use polar opposite display technologies. Traditionally, Samsung has equipped its Android flagship with a Super AMOLED screen, while Sony opts for an LCD. As you'd imagine, the differences between the two screens are immediately apparent once you put them next to one another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a close up shot of the Sony Xperia Z and Samsung Galaxy S4 display matrixes from our digital microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia Z and Samsung Galaxy S4 screens up close</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the contrast and color saturation of the Super AMOLED screens is beyond the reach of any LCD out there, which makes even the dullest image appear remarkably vibrant. And even if you are not a fan of the oversaturated look of AMOLEDs, Samsung is giving you the option to tune the saturation down for a natural look and enjoy the best of both worlds. There's a dedicated Adobe RGB setting that sees to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice thing about having Android 4.2 and an AMOLED screen is that you can download a Daydream for the Galaxy S4 that shows a simple clock on a black background and you can run this overnight without losing too much battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The impressive pixel density of both screens ensures that sharpness is as good as it gets on a handheld display. 441 ppi is actually so ridiculously high that it makes the Galaxy S4's PenTile matrix a non-issue. Typically, fewer sub-pixels (two per pixel instead of three), which is what PenTile means, would produce visible defects. Well, not on a 1080p screen obviously. Hardly surprising, given that jaggies were only occasionally visible from up close on the 306ppi Super AMOLED screen of the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z counters with the second generation of the company's Mobile Bravia Engine, a technology which on paper should make the biggest difference in video playback and image viewing. This may as well be the best smartphone display the Japanese have produced so far - especially considering the jump in resolution. Being the least reflective so far too, the screen does very well outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, that just isn't enough and the Xperia Z screen still falls short of the Galaxy S4 display in just about every aspect of its performance. The difference in viewing angles is particularly striking as the mediocre viewing angles of the Sony flagship look shocking next to the paper-like screen of the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The batteries of both phones are Li-Ion units and with capacities exceeding 2000mAh. The Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets (minor differences accounted for) powering both smartphones have so far demonstrated rather good power efficiency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 has a slight advantage in battery capacity - 2,600mAh over 2,330mAh - but its chipset is overclocked so we'll see how that balances out. Also, the screen types will make a difference, LCD usually does well on the web browsing test, while AMOLED typically fares better in the video test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with the Talk time test, the Sony Xperia Z swoops in to win it beating the Galaxy S4 with a lead of over 2 hours. In fact, it's the second best phone we've ever tested, which is truly impressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z was quick to waste its great advantage in the Web browsing test though with a score of 6 and a half hours. A mediocre score, considering the phone's LCD display, which in theory should work much better with the mostly white web pages. In comparison, the Galaxy S4 achieved the very good rating of 8 hours and 42 minutes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 lasted a solid 10 hours in our video test before the battery hit 10% (many phones refuse to play video below that threshold, so that's where we end). That's quite the movie marathon to while away a long flight (note: we do the test in offline mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z paled in comparison, only just making halfway, at 5 hours 39 minutes before reaching the 10% stop.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All things considered, the Xperia Z can give you two full days on a single charge, if you do an hour each of calling, web browsing and video watching a day. In the same usage pattern, the Samsung Galaxy S4 will last nearly three days. As we pointed out earlier, the battery of the Galaxy S4 is easily replaceable and Samsung will be selling a dedicated charger for a spare battery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the Xperia Z run Android Jelly Bean, but there are considerable differences. For one, the Samsung smartphone launches with 4.2.2 and the Xperia Z has 4.1.1 (with plans to bring it up to speed with an update). The custom skins used are quite different too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two skins, however, try to stay relatively close to Android (their latest versions more than ever). The Galaxy S4's UI piles on an impressive list of exclusive features that the Korean company developed for its flagship devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 gets certain benefits from running the latest version of Android, specifically the lockscreen widgets and the notification area toggles. Of course, Samsung has tweaked both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the lockscreen, the right side pane, which normally launches the camera, is set to Favorite Apps by default (you can switch it back to being a camera launcher). Also, the images on the screen are randomly selected photos of beautiful travel locations pulled straight from TripAdvisor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area shows a row of toggles, a brightness slider and, of course, the actual notifications. There's a whole grid of toggles, and the top row is always visible. The full grid is revealed either by tapping on a button or by a two-finger swipe (similar to stock Android), but you can also just swipe the row horizontally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness slider can be hidden to save space and it has an Auto toggle. In Auto mode, it lets you tweak the automatic brightness algorithm, making the display brighter or dimmer than its ambient light sensor will suggest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen on TouchWiz is pretty standard with only the Overview mode standing out as an addition to stock Android. We do like the small thumbnails that guide you when adding a new widget, they show the widget silhouettes, making it easier to find an open spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony too has updated its custom launcher to go with the new Android version it runs on. The lockscreen on the Xperia Z uses a new cool animation and has two shortcuts for quick access to the camera (swipe left) and the dedicated music controls (swipe right). When the music player is on, the lockscreen will show the music controls by default, but you can hide them with a swipe. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security. The Galaxy S4 has Face and Voice on top of that, but it's more of a gimmick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area on the Xperia Z features several connectivity toggles (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Mobile Data). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. Naturally the notification pane also displays the various notifications from different apps and you can resize those with pictures in them, as well as lists of emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The awesome task manager we saw on the Xperia T is here and so are the so-called "small apps". They are similar to Mini Apps from Samsung, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to fully open a dedicated app. So far, there's a default set of four: Calculator, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder - and it looks like you should be able to stock up on some more from the Play Store as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest one is obviously Multi-window - it allows for two supported apps to run simultaneously, sharing the screen. How the apps split the screen can be adjusted as desired. Not all apps support it, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing is Air View - the Galaxy S4 can detect your finger hovering over the screen and works similarly to the S Pen on the Galaxy Note II. It can preview info like the full text of messages and calendar appointments, give you a peek inside folders with images and preview what's ahead in the timeline of a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there are Air Gestures. A dedicated IR sensor above the screen can detect the direction of your hand waving over the device from several inches and serve to scroll web pages, change tracks and answer calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Screen options are interesting too, they make sure the screen is rotated correctly (the accelerometer-based rotate gets it wrong if you're lying on your side). The other nice thing is that the screen won't turn off while you're watching (or reading) and that the video will pause automatically when you look away and resume when you get back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice is also on board and while some of the functionality partially doubles that of Google's Voice Search, it can do more. It has a nice Car mode too, which simplifies the UI and makes the font bigger.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update, May 9: We added the Samsung I9500 Galaxy S4 (the Exynos 5 Octa one) to the benchmarks. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z and the Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4 are powered by Qualcomm chips: the difference between the regular Krait cores inside the S4 Pro (powering the Sony smartphone) and the Krait 300 of the Snapdragon 600 (in the Galaxy S4) are minor but all in favor of the later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most importantly, the S4 Pro packs four Krait cores, clocked at 1.5GHz, while the slightly updated Krait 300 cores can run at 1.9GHz in the Samsung Galaxy S4. In addition Krait 300 features a hardware data prefetcher that gets data from the smartphone memory and puts it in the much faster L2 cache before the CPU explicitly asks for it, thus improving the performance even at the same clock speed. There are a number of other changes, but there's no need to get too technical here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both smartphones are using 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU. The GPU clock speed is undisclosed but we suspect it's higher in the Galaxy S4 than the Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're also including the Samsung I9500 Galaxy S4 in the tests - that's the one using the Exynos 5 Octa chipset, with four Cortex-A15 cores at 1.6GHz cores (well, also four Cortex-A7s but those are for light loads and will not be used during the benchmarks), 2GB of RAM and PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first batch of benchmarks tests CPU performance - first of a single core (Benchmark Pi) and then the full multithreaded performance (Linpack and Geekbench). The Galaxy S4 narrowly takes the single-threaded performance and gets a more comfortable lead in the multi-threaded tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu and Quadrant are all-inclusive tests that gage pretty much every component (CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, etc.). Both of them place the Samsung Galaxy S4 ahead of the Xperia Z, by a significant margin. The newer chipsets are obviously paying handsome dividends.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With mobile phone screens topping FullHD resolution, GPUs are under more stress than ever. Luckily for the Galaxy S4 and the Xperia Z, the Adreno 320 is one of the fastest around. The PowerVR SGX544MP3 is also among the fastest - it's used in the Apple iPhone 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GLBenchmark 2.7 test runs at 1080p resolution off-screen, meaning the actual resolution of the physical screen doesn't matter, so we can compare raw performance. The Galaxy S4 tops the charts here, beating the Xperia Z by a good 10-12fps - That's nearly 40% difference in performance and the largest we have seen in all tests so far.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Epic Citadel is a tech demo for the latest Unreal Engine, which is bound to see use in real world games. We ran the test in full resolution with performance set to quality. The Samsung Galaxy S4 and Sony Xperia Z came very close in this test as both often hit the software limit of 60fps. The bottom line is both phones will run heavy games trouble-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we tested the web browser performance using the stock Android browser on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and Chrome on Xperia Z as those are the default browsing options on the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider showed vastly superior performance from the Galaxy S4 compared to the Xperia Z and even other droids.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z and the Samsung Galaxy S4 both have mono loudspeakers. On the Galaxy S4 it's located near the bottom of the back panel, while on the Xperia Z it is awkwardly placed in the bottom right corner of the phone, meaning you can easily cover it while watching a video or playing a game in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Partly due to the phone's water resistance perhaps, the loudspeaker on the Xperia only managed to post a Below Average score in our test. You'll hear the phone ring when it's on a desk in front of you and the vibration will make sure you'll feel it in your pocket, but if you carry the device in a purse or bag missed calls are likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After we tested the water resistance, the loudspeaker sounded muffled - perhaps down to a wet membrane. Sony says this is normal but it did take about an hour and a half for it to get back to normal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 scored a Good mark, outperforming the Xperia Z notably on every test we did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. Clearly, it is the louder device. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z has pretty good audio output. It did very well when connected to an active external amplifier and it didn't degrade too badly when we plugged in a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the Sony flagship is no match for the Galaxy S4 - it had a cleaner output than the Sony smartphone. While the two are on par when attached to an active external amplifier, the Galaxy S4 output had virtually no degradation when we plugged in a pair of headphones, while the Sony Xperia Z took a hit to its stereo crosstalk and let some distortion creep in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume levels of both phones are on par.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. The Xperia Z is not that far behind its rival here, though, and for most purposes the two can be considered on par.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera interface and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface on the Xperia Z consists of two panes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, video and still shot shutter keys, and a primary/secondary camera toggle. On the left you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three customizable shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all available settings for the given shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has also included the Superior Auto Mode and has selected that to be default when you launch the Xperia Z camera. The difference between the Superior auto mode (up to 12MP) and regular mode (up to 13MP) with all settings set to auto is that the first tries to guess what kind of scene you are trying to capture and adjusts all image parameters accordingly. This includes color saturation, contrast, metering mode and what not. The regular auto mode only sets the exposure automatically, but lets you fiddle with the other settings if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the Superior auto mode also tells you what it guessed so you can easily intervene if it gets it wrong. From what our experience so far shows, though, it gets things right almost every time, so unless you are a photography enthusiast or just have to have that extra megapixel of resolution, you're probably better off sticking to Superior auto.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia Z camera offers all kinds of features, including face detection, smile shutter, geo-tagging, touch capture and HDR mode. There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera shortcut on the lockscreen does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the Superior Auto and Normal Auto modes, you also get Burst (with three levels of speed), Sweep Panorama (resulting in about 5MP picture) and manual scene selection with pre-defined settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z camcorder interface is similar to the still camera UI but has fewer settings. There are three types of auto-focus modes - single, face detection and object tracking, but even if you select the single focus mode the smartphone will enable continuous autofocus. You can manually adjust white balance and exposure values, you can also use the LED flash for video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Xperia Z offers HDR for video capture, too, allowing you to capture better footage of scenes with higher contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came as a disappointment for us is the fact that even though the Xperia Z is able to capture still shots while recording video, it only produces images with 1 megapixel of resolution. That's basically as good as no feature at all, since the individual frames are twice that resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface of Samsung Galaxy S4 is a departure from the previous versions, which were based on the Galaxy S II interface. This one is based on the Galaxy Camera interface instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That means there are two virtual shutter keys (still and video) on the right, plus a mode button. Modes are picked from a carousel with descriptive images and text. At the bottom there's an up arrow for color effects - the cool thing is that all effects do a live preview, Samsung is really showing off the chipset's processing power here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the upper left corner, there are a couple of quick settings plus an arrow to reveal more options. One of the more prominent settings here is the dual shot mode, which snaps a photo with both cameras and presents them picture-in-picture style (think video call). You can move and resize the image from the front-facing camera that's taking a photo of you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the advanced settings you can activate Burst shot, Face detection and Image Stabilization or manually set the ISO value for the still camera. The camcorder settings include Image Stabilization and Video Resolution only. The third tab allows you to turn in/off geotagging and flash, manually set white balance and exposure values.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The worst thing about the shared camera interface that the Samsung Galaxy S4 employs is that framing 16:9 videos and 4:3 shots is hard on a single viewfinder. You either have to live without the maximum resolution for still shots or learn to frame videos in 4:3 mode and both of those options are pretty awkward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the different camera modes, it's a collection of some of the best camera features on current flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the rarest modes is 360 photo. That's basically the same as Photo Sphere - it creates a spherical panorama like you see in Google Street View. Nexus devices aside, the LG Optimus G Pro has such a mode. There's a regular panorama mode as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Sound &amp; shot - it snaps a photo and records a few seconds of background audio, which really gives photos an ambience. If you prefer to have motion in your shots instead of audio, you can create cinemagraphs with the Cine Photo mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the Eraser mode, which snaps a burst of photos and automatically detects moving objects and removes them. This is great for popular tourists' attractions as it's quite difficult to get a photo of those without at least one person walking into your shot. This is similar to Scalado based tech in Nokia Lumia phones and the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another mode is called Drama, which is basically the same as the HTC One's Sequence shot. It takes multiple photos of a moving subject and creates multiple "clones" of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode is available under the name Rich tone and there is a dedicated Sports mode and Night mode. You can enable auto night mode detection if you don't want to toggle it manually. There's no HDR for videos on the Galaxy S4, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar Best Photo and Best Face are, of course, available. They snap multiple photos and pick out the best one. In the case of Best Face, each face can be adjusted individually. So is Beauty Face, which attempts automatic photo retouching to remove "facial imperfections".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung Galaxy S4 also allows you to snap 9.6MP images while recording videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The Sony Xperia Z settings looks better organized and makes framing easier, while the newly adopted camera UI of the Galaxy S4 takes time getting used to. The Samsung flagship however makes up for that with a number of advanced shooting modes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 comes with a 13MP main camera and a 2MP secondary camera and the two can be used at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z features the new Sony Exmor RS sensor, also 13MP, and has a 2MP front facing camera as well. Unfortunately those two can't be used simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, let's talk Field of View (FoV), how much each camera captures. According to EXIF info, the Samsung Galaxy S4 camera is a 31mm (in 35mm equiv.), while the Sony Xperia Z is wider at 28mm. The difference is noticeable, but not too big a deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 captures very good amounts of fine detail (see bricks, wall texture, foliage) and the noise level is relatively low (check the sky). It shows oversharpening halos here and there, but no purple fringing. The color accuracy is good, though most of the time the colors are a bit oversaturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Superior Auto mode the Sony Xperia Z produces photos with pleasing, albeit slightly oversaturated colors. The images shot in Normal Auto, appear more natural and lack that overprocessed look. Since most of the users will use the default Superior Auto (which usually does better anyway), we shot our samples with this mode. Either way, though, the resolved detail is hardly spectacular and noticeably lower compared to Galaxy S4's samples and the noise levels are only average. There's also noticable purple fringing and while the dynamic range is on par between the two, the Galaxy S4 has the upper hand in terms of contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So even though the Sony Xperia Z produces decent shots overall, it doesn't even come close to the Galaxy S4 photos. Here go a few crops to illustrate our point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped a few photos in extreme lightning conditions. The first set of samples were taken with Auto/Normal Auto, the second pair were shot using the Night Scene presets, the third one - indoors with no additional lighting but the LED flash and the fourth - in a cloudy weather with Auto settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 exposes it low-light shots better than the Xperia Z's, no matter of the shooting mode. It lets in slightly more noise, but it also manages to preserve more detail and produce better colors than the Sony flagship. The Xperia Z picture quality improves though when set to shoot on Superior Auto (which automatically switch to Night Scene), in which case things are closer, but still slightly in favor of the Samsung flagship.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LED flash on the Samsung Galaxy S4 is a lot more powerful than the one used in the Sony Xperia Z and this is main reason for the disappointing indoor performance of Xperia Z when compared to the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the 100% crops where you can clearly see the Galaxy S4 superiority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the cloudy weather was no sweat for the Samsung Galaxy S4 - more than enough detail, good colors and contrast, while the Sony Xperia Z got the exposure wrong and produced a noisy sample with an only average amount of fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check the crops to see for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR samples from both phones are good, but the Galaxy S4 HDR stills are probably the best we've seen from a smartphone. The Samsung flagship takes a while to process the image but it has subtle yet good results. It mostly brings out detail in the highlights and gives shadows a slight boost without producing extra noise or ruining contrast. The Xperia Z is faster, also brings out detail in the highlights, but it does nothing for the shadows and noticeably lowers the contrast of the whole picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to comparing the panorama shots from the two smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that the Galaxy S4 must be used in portrait mode to be able to shoot a full-res 360-degree panorama, otherwise you'll get a lower-res, poorly stitched picture. We are not quite sure what the reason behind this is and it might have something to do with the software still being finalized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Samsung Galaxy S4 is capable of shooting a full-res 360-degree panorama, which results in photos of about 60MP resolution (roughly 20000x3000px). The picture quality is amazing and stitching is very good. Because the Xperia Z can't do 360-degree panos, we only covered the same viewing angle with the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z also offers very-well stitched panorama samples with good contrast, but that's the only good we can say. The detail could have been better, the resolution is very low at about 5000x1080px, and the whole thing looks more like a video screenshot (which it probably is given the resolution) rather than a shot worthy of a flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the Sony Xperia Z in our Photo Compare Tool. Both did excellently on all the charts, though once we come to a more real-life scenario (third poster), the noise reduction of Xperia Z takes its toll and the smartphone comes short of the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S4 and Sony Xperia Z in our Photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. The Samsung flagship has a clear advantage in terms of image quality over its competitor. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camcorder quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Sony Xperia Z and the Samsung Galaxy S4 can capture 1080p videos at 30 frames per second. The Xperia Z can also capture images while shooting video but it only produces 1 MP stills, while the Galaxy S4 snaps full-res 9.6MP stills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 and the Xperia Z have some unique features too - the Galaxy S4 can pause and resume the video capturing and it does the cool dual-recording which lets you capture footage with its two cameras simultatenously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z on the other hand offers HDR video recording, but sadly enabling that doesn't do as big a difference as we hoped. It still adds some detail in the highlight areas, which can make the difference between a usable and a poor video on some occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z videos come up with excellent detail and a solid 30fps framerate. Their bitrate hovers about the 16MBps mark, which is a decent compromise between quality and file size. The colors are accurate, not oversaturated but the white balance is warmer than it should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 stores videos in MP4 files with 17Mbps bitrate on average. Stereo audio is recorded at 128Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured with the Samsung Galaxy S4 have more fine detail than those recorded with its competitor and less noise. Colors and white balance are also a tad nicer, which makes the overall result more pleasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have the same field of view, but the Galaxy S4 resolves more detail. The Xperia Z colors are closer to reality, while those on the Galaxy S4 are a bit oversaturated. The white balance on both phones is complete opposite - warm on the Xperia Z and cool on the Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two phones are in our Video quality comparison data base too, so if you want to do some more pixel peeping you can proceed right ahead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S4 vs. Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. Despite doing worse than the Galaxy S III, the Galaxy S4 was still able to outresolve the Xperia Z and produce generally more pleasing videos. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's usually the hardware that makes a proper flagship - be it the chipset, the camera sensor, the screen resolution or the amount of RAM. Yet, it's only half the work done. The other half gets delivered on the software end. And we don't just mean a custom launcher or skin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Sony and Samsung have put a lot of effort in their own gallery, music and video player. There are connectivity apps too that boost your experience with connected devices such as TVs, PCs, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Xperia Z is called Album and it's among the most fluid and visually appealing apps you could find on any smartphone platform. Images are organized into stacks of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can opt to show all of your albums in one place, and there are three tabs above the stacks - Pictures, Map and Online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can pinch to resize the image thumbnails. The whole thing is super responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids with cool animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Album app supports highly customizable slideshow called SenseMe with several effects to choose from, and customizable music. Standard slideshow options is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Online tab displays pictures from Google Picasa and Facebook. You have options to tag, like and comment on Facebook photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BRAVIA engine enhances contrast, colors and sharpness, while simultaneously reduces noise, but the truth is videos and images still look better on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Super AMOLED superior display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy S4 has a new layout too. It can be sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. There's also a spiral option, which revamps the gallery into a Scalado-like spiral of images and video, which after a while gets really nauseating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the size of the thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that albums' stack of photos but a swipe to the right will reveal a bar that lets you switch albums without going back to the default screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a press and hold on a picture the gallery gives you the option to select multiple images, which you can then mass delete, share, copy or move.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos on the Galaxy S4 is a joy. The screen is ample and the Super AMOLED a treat when displaying colors. The gallery naturally supports full-res images. If you know what "color profile" is you can enable the Adobe RGB screen mode for accurate color rendering, if not you can just enjoy the vibrant colors of the default setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily retouch photos right in the Gallery itself. The photo editor gives you options like crop, rotate, color and effects. You can also make a memo on top of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery on the Galaxy S4 also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow. It is as cool as the SenseMe slideshow on the Xperia Z, but thanks to its advance settings and speed customization, it's actually better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Air view gesture works in the gallery as well. You can hover your finger above and image and you'll get a bigger thumbnail overview of the image or you can use it to peek inside folders. That's definitely something the Xperia Z can't do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a nifty detect text option in the Gallery's context menu, which does as advertised - it detects text on an image and converts it into a text file, which you can share via mail, messages, etc. Keep in mind that it requires a data connection to work. This is another plus over the Xperia Z Album app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. The Samsung flagship's Gallery app offers more options and advance features and while it's not as much fun as the Xperia Z Album it does its job better. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both smartphones boast 1080p screens with a massive 5" diagonal that's more than enough for watching movies on the go. As such they need proper video codec support to let you enjoy the full experience but the software that displays the content is equally important.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z and Galaxy S4 managed to play just about every video we threw at them. Xvid, DivX, MKV were all fine. The Galaxy S4 though handles AC3 codec well, while the Xperia Z doesn't support it and the movies with AC3 audio played without sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of the Xperia Z is dubbed Movies and it has a new interface. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TV shows you have preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the Xperia Z Movies app there is a huge animated thumbnail that shows the last few seconds of the last unfinished video playback. The video gallery sorts the videos by their type - Movies, TV shows, Nearby devices, Others. If you downloaded some TV shows episodes, they'll be sorted by seasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface is nothing out of the ordinary. It has a slightly WP8-influenced interface with an overlay featuring play/pause and FF/rewind along with a timeline, which can be scrubbed to jump to specific scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an option to "throw" the video to a connected BRAVIA TV set, as well as an ample sound settings menu. You can enable surround sound, clear stereo (which reduces channel crosstalk) and if you're watching a video with the built-in speaker instead of headphones you can enable xLOUD and Clear Phase (which automatically adjusts the quality). In truth we found only the clear stereo and surround sound options to really make a difference. Finally you can hop into the display settings straight from the video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia Z Movies app doesn't support subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new video player, found on the Galaxy S4 has the last watched video on top for quick access. Under it there are three tabs - personal (showing you the videos on your local storage), Download (which lets into the Videos store) and Nearby devices, which shows the PCs and players on your local Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is our favorite as it is a true quad-core tour de force - the visible video thumbnails are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate and generating those previews takes a couple of minutes the first time around, but it's an awesome preview and it shows what can be done when you have processing power to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too. The video player lets you squeeze the best viewing experience out of the large, high-res screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chapter preview detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hovering your finger over the timescroll lets you preview part of the video in a small thumbnail - just like YouTube videos do when you hover the mouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is here too - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S4. The Video Player of the Galaxy S4 might not be as eye-candy as the Movies app on the Xperia Z, but it handles AC3 audio and comes with rich subtitle support. The cool pop-up play and live video preview give even wider advantage. </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music Players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player we saw in Sony Xperia smartphones from the second half of 2012 is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it got even more sound enhancement options. It also offers rich audio codec support including FLAC and WAVE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SenseMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Throw option is also available so you can easily output the sound to a connected wirelessly device (audio system, TV set, etc).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's a new ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However die-hard audiophiles might prefer additional players, which sport a 10-band or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy S4 is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC, Wave, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted by the usual Artist, Album, Playlist, etc. but there's also Folder support (which is more often found on third party players) - it's quite handy as it saves you the need to sort songs into playlists like on so many other players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 can also search for content on third party players like PCs on the same network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also customize your own 7-band equalizer too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S4 has a couple of features that will improve your listening experience further. One is Smart Sound, which equalizes the volume between tracks. The other is Adapt Sound - it plays a series of beeps (both high and low frequency) and asking if you can hear them. This way the phone can map the capacities of your specific headset and fine tune the sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options - a timescroll of the song, play/pause and back/forth controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control, AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While listening to a song you can find music controls in the notification area and the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has enabled a great new feature called Adapt Sound. It determines the best possible sound setup for your choice of headphones by doing a frequency test and resolving which frequencies you can hear and which not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It then shows you the sound gain you're receiving by turning Adapt Sound on. Turns out that some of us here have average hearing but we still did okay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Both phones offer excellent music players with lots of advanced options and audio enchantments that will certainly keep the audiophiles happy. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>MULTIMEDIA WINNER: Samsung Galaxy S4. Samsung has supplied the Galaxy S4 gallery and video apps with a host of cool features, which gave it an edge over its competitor today. </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, we started with the inevitable, and end on the unexpected. The Sony Xperia Z and Samsung Galaxy S4 are the crown jewels of their respective lineup and on the (very short) shortlist of contenders for smartphone of the year, so the one-way traffic throughout is coming right out of the blue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony managed to deliver its smartphone to the market two months earlier than the competition and has been cashing in on that advantage very well since. However, Samsung obviously used the time well and brought a product that is ready to overwhelm the Xperia Z, when it hits the shelves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 is equipped with the latest version of the Android OS and will come powered by the two most potent chipsets in the smartphone market. It also comes with that impressive 5-inch 1080p SuperAMOLED display that nearly humiliated Sony's mildly disappointing screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9500 Galaxy S4 ? Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 easily comes across as the superior smartphone, but does it mean that the Xperia Z should start packing? Is there really nothing that the best of Sony in a smartphone can offer against the best Samsung smartphone? Of course there is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z is still an impressively capable package and one of the coolest pieces of smartphone design. The IP57 certification will appeal to the outdoorsy type who need a smartphone with better than average protection against the elements. And we wouldn't say that water resistance is its best bet at staying relevant. The Xperia Z is better than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With all the tests we did and numbers thrown around it's easy to forget that the Sony Xperia Z offers impressive smartphone experience and comes in a beautiful glass-clad body. And mind you, it wasn't Samsung's goal to make the Galaxy S4 the best kept secret by giving it a finish that just doesn't look premium. Anyway, if you don't need all the extra goodies of the Galaxy S4, why not give your eyes a treat. Of course, in that case you should also give the HTC One a serious consideration, but that's the topic for a yet another shootout. And you can bet it's coming up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, if you chose the Sony Xperia Z for the looks and the water resistance, you don't need us telling you it's money well spent. By the way, we are certain that many bought the Xperia Z because there was nothing better on the market at the time. This will be the reasoning of future Galaxy S4 owners too. To be fair though, that's easier said about the Xperia Z then, than it is for the Galaxy S4 now. Oh well, it's a compliment that goes both ways. And rightfully so.</paragraph>
