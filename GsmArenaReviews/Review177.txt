			<paragraph>A phone like no other or a quick-fix Cyber-shot Walkman mongrel trying to pass off as a hip novelty - you can call the Sony Ericsson W902 whatever you like, but it will still be the best cameraphone among music phones. The 5 megapixel auto focus camera opens a new chapter in the Walkman book, while everything else about the W902 walks and talks multimedia. Based on the excellent Sony Ericsson feature phone interface, you get all sorts of treats like the top-of-the-line Media Center with screen auto rotation, Shake control and SensMe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There may be hardly anything else to wish for in a feature phone, though GPS and Wi-Fi in the latest Walkmans might make the W902 stumble a bit. But it still has a special place booked in the hearts of brand loyal fans who are no longer forced to choose between imaging and music, Walkman and Cyber-shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been a while since the Sony Ericsson W902 was released on the market and though we had a little preview out pretty much before everyone else, we somehow managed to miss a dedicated detailed review of this promising chap in the hectic winter months of 2008. Well, it's time to sort that and now that we secured a fully retail-ready Sony Ericsson W902, we are more than happy to take it out for a spin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let's take a look at where the W902 currently stands on the market taking into account the pretty capable competition as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 currently retails online at the rather steep contract-free price of around 300-350 euro (or 400 US dollars). At a similar price (or a little less than that) you can probably also opt for the Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani. Its flashy night effects, Armani branding, dedicated music keys, and 3.5mm audio jack will get it noticed as a potential alternative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung M7500 Emporio Armani</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite its music slant, the Armani is part of another market segment and is some features (and megapixels) short of the W902. Both are stylish gadgets with an ear for music so in the end it's a matter of priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Amazingly, you can get the quite capable Sony Ericsson C902 Cyber-shot for around 100 euro less than the W902. It's got a nice slide-up camera cover, a bunch of touch-sensitive camera shortcuts and pretty similar multimedia capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson C902</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another trim and slim 5 megapixel sharpshooter is Samsung F480. It makes up for the missing music features with a large touchscreen display and superb image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung F480</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to music, Nokia's XpressMusic just can't be ignored. The latest touchscreen Nokia 5800 costs about the same as the Sony Ericsson W902. The camera performance on the 5800 sucks, but it offers a touch-based user interface, Symbian OS, GPS, Wi-Fi and really great audio quality. The huge screen, VGA video recording and the 3.5mm audio jack don't make things for the W902 either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having said all that, we should point out that when you buy a Walkman phone, you don't just buy the hardware, but one of the best user experiences for a feature phone. The Sony Ericsson W902 is surely heavily overpriced right now, but once it settles at a more reasonable price tag, it will be a great buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meet us on the next page, where we'll go through its looks, handling and ergonomics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What's in the box?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 has all you may possibly need in its retail package. A battery charger, USB data cable and headset is stuff you take for granted. The stereo headphones are the usual high-quality kit you get with Sony Ericsson handsets. It's a two-piece headset with a stylish remote that ends on a 3.5 mm plug, so you can use your own set of earphones too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the standard equipment, the W902 ships with a USB M2 card reader, to ease handling of the 8 gigs of external storage, which is also prebundled. We first saw an M2 card reader in the W910 box. The one that comes with Sony Ericsson W902 is the same as what you get with the Cybershot top dog C905.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W902 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 measures 110 x 49 x 11.7mm and weighs 99.8 grams. It is indeed very pocket-friendly, but quite strong and solid too. As to design, we'll just say it again. Sony Ericsson have long crossed the line between recognizable and repetitive. Perhaps even the most conservative of Walkman fans have had enough of new releases that look anything but new outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W902 is the first Walkman bar to feature dedicated music controls on the side and they're welcome for allowing quick control of the Walkman player without even having to open the application itself. Pressing and holding the Play/Stop button will launch the music player in mini mode and music will resume where you last left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our main concern is those keys do take some time getting used to. Before we got the hang of it, we did risk dropping the handset using the side music keys. The Samsung Emporio Armani felt notably more stable and easier to handle. It has the same music controls on the right hand side, but is way lighter and doesn't have the rounded edges of the W902.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman key is atop the Sony Ericsson W902. It launches the Walkman 3.0 player fullscreen and is used for Shake control. You can skip tracks and shuffle your playlist on the W902 by a simple flick of the hand while holding down the Walkman key. Seriously, this sounds awesome on paper, but it's really annoying in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman button is hard to push and sinks very little with zilch of press feedback, so you almost never know if you pressed it right. What's more, its location at the top of the handset almost completely rules out a secure grip - and that's quite needed if you're about to jerk your phone up and down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, if you make the move right, a slight vibration will indicate your shake command has been acknowledged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset only features the proprietary connectivity port, which once again is exposed. That however is hardly its biggest issue. It's used for connecting the headset of course and having it placed towards the bottom of the left side is perhaps not the most comfortable solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom parts of the handset are quite discreet. The already mentioned Walkman key is the only thing to find at the top. The bottom has an etched Walkman logo and the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long crevice is to be seen at the top of the W902 front panel. The actual earpiece only takes less than a quarter of it. On either side are the video-call camera and the ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Sony Ericsson W902 is quite comfortable. The keys are well-sized with enough spacing between rows. Nice tactility and solid press leave little to wish for here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The control and navigation deck features two circular patterns on either side of a round D-pad. Sony Ericsson have always been keen to squeeze in quite a few controls and the W902 is another example of well used space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call and End keys only feel a bit too small for our liking, but they are still nicely raised and tactile enough. All the buttons have a very precise and solid press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is, without exaggeration, perfect. Not only does it handle and respond nicely, it looks a treat with the stylish copper-colored accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Backlighting makes it even better. The alphanumeric keypad and controls backlight in solid white, which is quite pleasant and friendly. The only bit that glows on the D-pad is the little circle around the confirm button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the music player is ON the D-pad and soft keys illuminate in dense dark orange and the handset looks really hot in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The control we probably like best on the W902 is the dedicated camera key. Its size is just right while the comfort and responsiveness are a nice taster of the improved camera performance in the new Walkman.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker though, which doubles as a zoom lever, is quite disappointing. Slim and flat, it has a very poor press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the camera key and the volume controls have the same coppery finish as the D-pad but it does feel too much. It could've been well more subtle we guess.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A pat on the back<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The rear side of the handset features the 5 megapixel camera, the LED flash and the loudspeaker. A lanyard eyelet is also there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The middle section of the rear panel with the Sony Ericsson logo has a kind of scale-like texture, which extends to the side of the handset where the music keys are placed. It won't actually improve the grip but is a nice accent that gives the phone a sturdy tool-like look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only other thing to note here is the slight creak of the rear panel that bothered us back when we did the preview. Sorry to break it to you but it's still there and worse. The slide-to-remove rear cover obviously won't lock properly and the loose bit slides up and down. It was very irritating to have that every time we picked up the phone. Every time!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back panel are the hot-swappable M2 card slot and the 930 mAh Li-Po battery. Quoted at the impressive 9 hours of talk time and 380 hours of stand-by, the battery is more than adequate for almost every user. Intensive music playback, which a Walkman will sure get, won't drain it too fast. With the W902 you can safely count on two days of fairly heavy usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of Sony Ericsson W902 is very good. But that's actually a criticism on our side. It could've been excellent was it not for the wobbly rear. The plastic casing could have used some metal here and there but that's a minor issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is generally solid and sturdy and handles quite comfortably. The Walkman key (in shake control mostly) and the volume rocker are minor exceptions.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fine display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2.2" 262K-color screen of QVGA resolution is very good. It has great contrast and a truly vibrant picture. The good brightness levels secure an excellent mark for the display indoors. Outdoor performance of the sunlight legibility is is as nice as the one of Sony Ericsson C905 - not perfect, but still good. Still, the W902 is well ahead of the Samsung Emporio Armani OLED screen in terms of performance in bright light.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface shines<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The high-end Sony Ericsson W902 has the the most advanced version of the UI of the house. It is customizable with Flash Lite themes and hardly ever stays static. The interface offers an extensive set of options and settings. They are complemented by great speed, which further improves the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Sony Ericsson have set up a nice little interactive demo tool for you to explore the phone interface and features online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with readings on top including signal strength, currently used data carrier and battery status. At the bottom of the display, just above the context keys are their labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper bellow is always on the move and really comes alive when the music player is on, making smooth transitions when playback starts or stops.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard foursome - theme-dependent, 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view. Rotating view features three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden, just as an indication of what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar, which features tiny icons for the other main menu entries. Neither of those view modes works with shortcut keys. Only the Grid view allows quick numeric keypad access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with the Sony Ericsson W980, you can minimize the progress indicator when receiving a file over Bluetooth but you can't do that when sending a file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode can only work with a SIM card in the device and requires a restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is visually appealing and snappy. Auto rotation is enabled in the Media Center and is generally quite responsive. There's a hardly noticeable lag involved but we guess that's to be preferred over an over-sensitive accelerometer that can often play up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Traditional phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way you can set up the phone to auto save to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up your contacts list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact uses the tabbed interface used throughout the phone. There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and finally the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you can add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of the contact is written in only one field, but you still have the option to order contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and it does so quite well, even a "John von Smith" won't be a problem. Naturally, you can search by gradual typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling of calls is excellent and we didn't experience any voice quality or reception problems with the Sony Ericsson W902. Call clarity is great in both the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Search is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed Call Log application should be familiar if you've used a fairly recent Sony Ericsson handset. It displays in four tabs, including All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to or from a single contact, only the last one gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 scored a Good mark in our loudspeaker performance test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson W902 offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts, and the option to assign categories to messages. The Manage Messages application enhances message handling. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W902 handles all common types of messages, all of which - save for emails - share a common inbox. When composing a message, a warning is displayed when you exceed the 160-character limit, to let you know that the message will be divided in two (or more if necessary) parts for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a rich T9 dictionary. The SMS and MMS messages share an editor; when typing SMS you could easily convert it into an MMS via the options menu or using the attach-stuff toolbar below the text box to insert images, animations, videos or sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone automatically downloaded the settings for our Gmail account. The options to view messages full screen and change font size really helped to get a lot of text on the screen. Even at the smallest font setting text remained legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email you get the Manage Email feature, which has the same functionality as the one for text messages. Saving attachments is problem-free, even if the phone doesn't recognize the file type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone can't handle any documents that are attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of a document reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Media Center keeps things in line<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Media Center on the Sony Ericsson W902 is the centerpiece of the phone's interface. It is in essence a gallery for all the media the device can handle, all navigated through a sleek, simple and intuitive interface. It allows instant access to the Photos, Music, Videos, Games and Web Feeds on the handset The current pick is highlighted and the count of stored files is displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Sony Ericsson W902 is equipped with a built-in accelerometer, the Media center interface rotates automatically to match the handset orientation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson photo gallery is definitely among the best we've found in a feature phone. It's a convenient tool for managing a vast collection of pictures with great customization capabilities and features. Some of those options include: one-click access to the latest snapshot you've taken, timeline view for your images and tags that can later be used for filtering. With Sony Ericsson W902 you can also mark some of your photos as favorite and make accessing them even easier through the favorite photo feed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos is a joy with the Sony Ericsson W902, especially when browsing images fullscreen. When you want to go to the next in line, it doesn't simply pop up but instead slides in from left or right. Then, when exiting the full screen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One place where the music and imaging skills of the phone come together is the Slide show. You're prompted to pick a mood (you can choose "silent" too) so it can set the proper music background and transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone doesn't have a GPS receiver but still does geotagging using Cell ID. You have the option to view the location (approximate of course) where the picture was taken on map (Google Maps) .</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman rocks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 features the Walkman 3.0 player with all possible extras included. Accessed from the really nice Media menu, the player supports a vast collection of file formats and has several equalizer presets. In addition, you also get Album art and the proprietary Sony Ericsson Shake control making use of the phone's built-in accelerometer. The accelerometer is also put to use for automatic rotation of the display. Naturally the music player also offers step-by-step filtering of the tracks you want to hear. The D-pad is in charge of music controls and also brings up a list of all the tracks in the current playlist or album. As we already mentioned, the keys on the side of W902 are a nice set of alternative music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The "Now playing" screen is simple but offers all the needed controls and information. The D-pad offers playback controls with their functions shown at the bottom of the screen. Above them is information on the current track such as album art, song duration, track name, performer and album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of album art, you can opt for visualizations but since they occupy the same small space as the album art you're not to expect a grand light show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The animations on the home screen during playback make up for that though. They depend on the currently selected Flash Lite theme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you minimize the music player, the currently playing track, album and artist get displayed on the home screen with some nice graphics that perfectly blend with the screen if a Flash Lite theme is used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizers appear as fullscreen graphics on the Sony Ericsson W902. You can also create a custom equalizer if the presets don't do the trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another highly promoted Walkman feature is Shake control. It allows you to change the currently running track and even shuffle your entire playlist by a simple flick of the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to use Shake control is press the Walkman key and shake the phone forward (for going one track forward) or backward (for going a track back). A quick succession of the two moves does the shuffle trick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also turn the volume up and down by gently tilting the handset while you hold the Walkman key pressed. Again, these are nice little gimmicks but the Walkman location makes it rather uncomfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other high pitched Walkman goodie, SensMe, is a different approach to populating a playlist. Instead of choosing genre or performer, you are presented with a coordinate system. The vertical axis is the tempo - fast to slow, and the horizontal axis is the mood - sad to happy. Songs are shown as dots placed accordingly and you use a circle to select the one fitting your mood best. You can of course modify the radius of the circle and repeat this several times for a single playlist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As cool as that sounds it does have an inconvenience - the songs must be tagged by the Sony Ericsson Media Manager software. To do this you use the manager to transfer the songs with the SensMe analysis option enabled. Tagging songs by hand is not possible so you need to choose between analyzing the songs with the Media Manager, which takes a while, or do without SensMe until you have more time to transfer the songs properly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of Sony Ericsson W902 is a mixed bag. The distinct music focus of the handset and Sony's great experience in the area had us hoping for much better results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came as a surprise to us is the frequency response of the Sony Ericsson W902. It has extremely boosted bass and treble and reduced mid frequency sounds. The graph looks as if an equalizer has been applied only that it wasn't. We can hardly imagine how far off the frequency response will be if you actually apply one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have noticed such behavior on some other Sony Ericsson handsets - but only at their maximum volume. The frequency response of the W902 however seemed to deteriorate even further when we reduced the volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side all of the other reading are pretty good with the distortion levels simply great. The stereo crosstalk is also one of the best we have come upon recently. You can see for yourselves from the following results that save for the frequency response the Sony Ericsson W902 is quite a gifted musician.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on the Sony Ericsson W902 supports RDS and TrackID. You can store up to 20 stations and use the auto save feature to scan and save stations automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio can be minimized to play in the background and controlled via the Walkman keys but, unlike the music player, it doesn't have any visualization on the home screen, not even the RDS info. The previous/next buttons can be used for tuning in - one short click for going 0.1 MHz up or down, and a longer press for switching between saved stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Sony Ericsson W902 supports fast-forward and rewind, and slow-mo playback. It can play in landscape and has three options for video size - original, auto fit and full screen (which crops the video if needed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature of the video player is the screenshot capability. It allows you to save a frame of video and add it to the gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera: Walkman meets Cyber-shot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 packs a 5-megapixel autofocus camera capable of taking shots of maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels (the average file size is a tad below 1.3 MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W902 is the first Walkman that won't let imaging play second fiddle and its 5 megapixel camera is here to prove it. On the other hand, video recording is a bit disappointing with QVGA resolution at 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right above the camera lens is placed the Photoflash (a.k.a. PowerLED) - it's no match for a xenon flash but has its uses in close quarters. For one, it works in BestPic mode and can serve as video light. It's also used as an autofocus assist beam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's roll back and start with the basics. The straightforward guess is the Sony Ericsson W902 uses the same camera as its Cyber-shot sibling C902. The only difference is the absent Face Detection feature, which we won't pretend we miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You still get all the other niceties like image and video stabilizer, BestPic, auto-rotate, macro mode, camera images geo-tagging (based on cell-ID), etc. The user interface also has Cyber-shot written all across. Settings are displayed in the viewfinder on a toolbar with pop-up submenus. Traditionally, the viewfinder toolbar lets you control shoot mode, scenes, picture size, LED flash, self-timer, white balance, effects, and settings (Multi menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image stabilizer is supposed to keep images from blurring in dark environments but, as in all phone cameras so far, it's purely a software tweak of questionable efficiency. Plus no stabilization can help you if your subjects are moving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ultra quick-snapping BestPic mode has two varieties - fast and slow. In fast mode it produces 9 full-size 5 megapixel images for about 1.3sec, each of them of approximately 1MB of size. Saving all the images on the memory card afterwards takes about 15 seconds. The slow mode takes 9 images again but in a larger interval of about 2.5sec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 doesn't have GPS on-board but is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images based on cell tower triangulation. This seems to work quite fine with relatively accurate estimation in dense city areas, where cell towers are closely positioned, but your mileage in other scenarios may vary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When browsing tagged images in the gallery, you have access to a "View on map" tab from the options menu, which displays your location directly on the preinstalled Google Maps. If you pair the phone with an external GPS receiver, the geotagging feature automatically starts to use it to collect exact GPS coordinates for the images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated macro mode in W902 allows you to take images from as close as 10 cm (focus lock is reported in the viewfinder even at 8 cm but the image is actually a bit blurred). The silent shooting mode completes the features list of the W902 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer the camera is also able to auto-rotate your images when you are previewing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 camera is identical to that of the Cyber-shot branded C902. Picture quality accordingly experiences the same highs and lows. The W902 may not have a true rival among Walkmans but the image processing algorithm has a few issues that need sorting out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images are crisp with nice contrast but traces of oversharpening are to be seen all over. Both color and luminance noise levels are way too high and are probably also the result of aggressive sharpening. The lens used also seems to be imperfect resulting in easily visible and quite irritating purple fringing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, macro photos turn out pretty good with more than sufficient detail. Color rendering is better than most other Sony Ericsson handsets but still not perfect. The colors turn out a bit colder than they actually are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the W902 is also capable of capturing video, even if it's only limited to QVGA resolution at 30fps. The clips are recorded in mp4 format and take about 3 MB for every minute of recording. Interestingly enough, the W902 camera is officially quoted to record stereo sound to video clips.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The W902 offers the full range of connectivity options. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board, so there is virtually no spot on earth where you will be unable to connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, you've got the fastest data transfer around, provided that a HSDPA-enabled network is available. By the way the compatible UMTS frequency is only 2100Mhz and, unlike the C902, Sony Ericsson W902 is not reported to have localized versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, Sony Ericsson W902 offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options. There is also support for the A2DP profile allowing listening to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. Last, but not least, there is also the M2 card slot which might just turn out to be one of the quickest means of transferring data on some occasions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC, while the remote synchronization works with remote servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB connectivity has four modes. The first one is File transfers, which is self-explanatory. Then comes the USB Internet in case you need to use the phone as a modem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third one is the Media transfer, which directly connects to Windows media player, and gives full access to tracks placed on your phone, synchronization, play or sorting into playlists. The last one is for direct printing of images.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browsing: screen size is the limit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 has an Access NetFront browser v3.4 featuring the extended custom home screen, also available in many previous Sony Ericsson handsets (like G705, C905 and T700, which we recently reviewed). Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen, right under a search and an address bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They grant access to free content, such as clips, tracks and games on the Sony Ericsson site, including a step-by-step guide for setting up email accounts or internet connections. The appearance of the home screen changes in varying lively colors each time you start the browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elaborate web pages are rendered well and there are lots of configurable settings too. The dedicated full screen mode is replaced by the auto-rotate feature, which actually opens it in full-screen landscape mode. View modes include Text only, Pan and Zoom, and Zoom page. The Panning/scrolling speed is up to standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer, which is a real pleasure to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option. It searches the loaded web page and the first match is immediately listed as soon as you type a letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If are still not satisfied with this browser, you can always count on the superb OperaMini.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tasks &amp; more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W902 offers a wide range of time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Alarms, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Light, Calculator, and Code memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers monthly and weekly views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar. Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages; the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alarms are part of the main menu. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the free memory available the only restriction. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the well known basic applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LED light on the back of the phone can also be used as a torch, thanks to the Light application. The LED can be on continually or for a period of one minute only. It can also blink out an SOS signal.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lots of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as the additional applications are concerned, the Sony Ericsson W902 comes with several applications preinstalled: AccuWeather.com, Music Quiz, Standby World 3D, Walk Mate and a YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AccuWeather app gives you up-to-date weather information for locations of interest to you. It provides detailed information about the current weather conditions in the selected region, as well as a 3-day forecast. You should bear in mind that it requires an internet connection and data charges may apply.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Quiz is exactly what its name says - you have to name the title, artist, album or year of release of random tracks in your music library. Long story short: a part of a song is played each round and you have 5 to 30 seconds to guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Standby World 3D is a nice application with readings for up to three different time zones around the world. The background changes as day turns into night in the selected locations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walk Mate is a simple step counter application, which works in background mode based on the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And at the end we find the YouTube client, which gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarking favorites and so on. It's really nice and it's also tightly integrated in the Media center, so it's always on hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the beta of the Java application is available for download over at YouTube website.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Location services and knowing your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Available for free download and compatible with a variety of mobile OS and Java-enabled handsets, the Google Maps for Mobile come preinstalled in the W902. With Location services you can get help finding your way, view information about your current location and save your favorite locations. To use all features of the Location services internet access is a must.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After defining a start and end location, the possible routes are being calculated with overall guidance, based on the available information in the database. With the GPS Enabler HGE-100, plugged in, Location service gets full GPS functionality, as well as A-GPS for faster satellite lock. This makes it possible to use navigation on the go, with turn-by-turn guidance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two different view modes are available - Satellite and Map view. Traffic information is another important feature here. The user interface is nice and intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a plugged in GPS receiver, the Status info application displays the current activity in km/h for a 60 minutes period. The GPS connection status is indicated on the second tab of this application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, saving your most recent routes is as easy as it could be. Within several clicks, a title, description and position is all you need to save a favorite location.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games are amusing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 packs three preinstalled games: FMX III Hardcore, JewelQuest2 and Need for Speed Pro Street.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one - FMX III Hardcore - is a bike stunts game with nice 3D graphics. You have to go through various stunt events collecting bonus items and execute stunts at the same time. You can choose to play either in portrait or in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>JewelQuest2 is a puzzle game. You have to rearrange precious relics to turn tiles into gold as you advance through the entertaining levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Need for Speed: Pro Street game has cool 3D interface and is well worth giving a try (or a shake if you prefer). It can be controlled by simply tilting the phone left or right thanks to the built-n accelerometer. We however did prefer the old-fashioned D-pad control.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W902 is a neat and attractive mobile phone, with solid multimedia and imaging skills. It's got an excellent music player, a bright and lively display and, most of all, it's the first Walkman to take 5 megapixels photos. The relatively slim design and the 8 gigs worth of storage are a welcome bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Sony Ericsson W902 has a rather small screen, while the mediocre camera quality and poor video recording are not quite in line with the high asking price. Plus, it risks getting outshined by upcoming Walkmans that feature GPS and Wi-Fi, like Sony Ericsson W715.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman branding and features may entice enough people to spend their buck but hardly justify the 100 euro premium over the almost identical Sony Ericsson C902.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our overall impression of Sony Ericsson W902 remains positive and we enjoyed the time we had with it. But we can't ignore the obvious: it's anything but competitive with that 300+ euro price tag. We hate to say it but instead of making the best of the unique Cyber-shot Walkman blend, the W902 will be hoping for a late comeback as a reasonably priced and reasonably dated all-rounder.</paragraph>
