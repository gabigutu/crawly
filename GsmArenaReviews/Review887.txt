			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Jolla may be a completely new name in the smartphone game, but the people in charge are no rookies. Founded by former Nokia employees, the Finnish company is looking to give the MeeGo platform a new lease of life. Established in 2011, it took Jolla two years to unveil its first product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Their first handset is called just like company itself - Jolla, but while the naming wasn't particularly innovative the Sailfish-based smartphone certainly is. It's pretty clear that plenty of fresh new ideas went into its development and the result is quite different from anything else you can get in the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Jolla smartphone runs Sailfish OS - a successor of the MeeGo open platform, which Jolla took and developed further. In a way, it could be viewed as MeeGo 2.0 However, Jolla would like to start fresh and not carry the burden of its neighbor, who abandoned the project that many truly loved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are yet to see if the new Finnish kid on the block will feature the same sort of magic as the Nokia N9, which made so many mourn the end of MeeGo. For starters here are the key Jolla specs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Jolla at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Given the price tag, the mid-range specifications came as somewhat of a nasty surprise when Jolla unveiled its smartphone. However history has shown that a smartphone can be much more than a sum of its parts and we shouldn't write off any device before giving it a proper test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while the screen resolution could have certainly been higher, you can't blame this one for skimping on innovation. The Jolla phone is made out of a unique combination of aluminum and premium plastic and sports a replaceable back panel dubbed "the Other Half", which allows you to automatically change profiles with covers. The smartphone is meant to</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the unique situation that the newly born company faces, that seems to be the only logical step to take - building a very close relationship with its first customers. These are the people who are ready to invest their hard-earned cash into the unknown and they should be treated deserve something beyond mere specifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us after the break as we take a look at the hardware of the first Jolla smartphone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail package ticks the nerdy checkbox<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making a great first impression is crucial for every smartphone manufacturer. Jolla is aware of this and has turned special attention to the starting point of every smartphone ownership - the retail box. It's very well designed and unlike any retail box we've seen - it actually displays part of the code of the Sailfish OS fading away into a white background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pushing the inner box from a special cuthole reveals a special The Other Half back cover (more on that in a second) painted in bright orange that proudly says "The first one". The rest of the accessories include a standard microUSB cable and an AC adaptor that outputs 1A current. Jolla has also included a couple of black and white stickers that make the whole experience a tad more special.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Headphones were noticeably missing from the package, which was a bit disappointing. With the sort of price tag Jolla chargers, we certainly should have get a headset and probably a microSD card too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Jolla 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Jolla measures 131.0 x 68.0 x 9.9mm, which makes its footprint more or less on par with other smartphones with 4.5" displays. However it's not quite the slimmest and at 141 grams not too light either. You do get the nice solid feel that comes with extra heft, but portability isn't the best for the class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the Jolla from every angle in our 360-degree spin below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and built quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Jolla has a very intriguing design that's definitely appealing. Since the junior phonemaker is made entirely out of Nokia renegades that keep the MeeGo spirit in their hearts, the Jolla ought to be a worthy successor to the Nokia N9, which calls out for a solid built quality and cool, innovative design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy to report that the Jolla delivers. The phone sports the so-called two-half design - Jolla frequently refers to each of the halfs as "pillow". The front half, which holds the phone's internals, is made out of aluminum. The second half is actually the back cover and is made out of plastic. Thankfully, it's of the premium kind and complements the aluminum well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned earlier, this is the "Other Half" - each Jolla back cover is equipped with an NFC chip. Once snapped into place, the chip communicates with the phone, and the phone can apply a major user interface overhaul every time a new back cover is snapped. Our only gripe with it is that it's a bit hard to remove and makes an unpleasant cracking noise when you peel it off the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the difference in the choice of materials used for each half makes for an interesting design. The unfortunate downside to this design is that it makes the Jolla a bit thick. It's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but it might turn some people off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Jolla is particularly beautiful, as the glass of the display wraps around the sides of the aluminum. It's not just a design treat, as this makes swiping sideways gestures more comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The edges of the Jolla are sharp and the phone looks quite boxy from the front. It's not too bad though, as the chamfered sides break from the boxy-ness that the Jolla exudes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the aluminum construction, it's as sturdy as a phone can get and nothing squeaks or twists. Due to the significant gap where the halves meet, the Jolla is very comfortable to hold. Your fingers naturally rest there, which greatly improves handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back, as we mentioned, is made out of premium plastic, which is nicely resistant to fingerprints. In fact, after prolonged periods of use, we didn't even have to wipe the back. The front, on the other hand, is quite easy to turn into a greasy mess.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's start the controls breakdown from the front of the Jolla. It's free of any buttons - capacitive or physical - as the Jolla Sailfish OS is entirely based on gestures. Unsurprisingly, the earpiece is located above the display with the 2MP front-facing camera sitting on its left. Barely visible on the right side stand the ambient and proximity sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is a small RGB LED strip which lights up when the phone is charging or connected to a computer. It also blinks on missed events such as calls, messages and email - in green, blue and yellow, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone sports a cool looking duo of grills - one on the left and right sides. The speakers are on the left grille, while the main microphone is hidden behind the right grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving along to the top of the Jolla we find a secondary microphone used for active noise cancellation, the microUSB port for charging and transfering data as well as the 3.5mm headphone jack. The top left side features a small Jolla logo, which looks quite nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Jolla is free of any controls and ports. The Power/Lock button and volume rocker and on the right hand side and are made of metal. They have a very nice tactile feedback to them, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the back is quite minimalist in design and holds the 8MP camera with LED flash at its top right. The bottom also contains another Jolla logo. Just like the first one that's on top of the phone, this second one is quite hard to spot at first sight. It's translucent and you have to look at it from an angle to spot it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover, a.k.a the Other Half, of the Jolla fits quite tight and is opened with a sequence - from left to right. Once you remove it, you get access to the 2,100mAh battery. Above it are located the microSD card slot and the microSIM slot. The latter sports a rubbery flap right below it to keep the SIM card from popping out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two pins above the top left corner of the battery that allow 5V input and enable the creation of back panels with built-in battery packs. There are also the I2C pins, which permit the connection of an external input device, such as a slide-out keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature of the secondary back panel is the NFC chip, which allows it, once snapped into place, to change the visual aspects of the user interface like wallpapers, icons and sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jolla promises the 2,100mAh battery will last up to 500 hours in 3G stand-by and will be able to handle up to 10 hours of 3G talk-time. However, now it's too early for us to carry out our traditional battery tests to find out exactly how long the Jolla will last. We'll save this for our full review later on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Jolla smartphone is built around a 4.5" IPS LCD display, which seems to be a common display size for mid-range smartphones lately. It sports a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels giving it a pixel density of 245ppi. You don't need us to tell you that this is disappointing, considering there are phones twice as cheap that sport 720p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jolla could've done better here, but at least the display is covered with a Gorilla Glass 2 protective layer, which should help against light scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display itself is decent in color rendering, but fails to impress us in terms of contrast and is not even as good as some mid-range smartphones, such as the Moto G. The viewing angles aren't perfect and there's notable color when you are not looking stratigh at the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brightness isn't too impressive and combined with the rather high reflectivity lead to rather disappointing performance of the Jolla screen outdoors.

			<subsectionTitle>User interface provided by Sailfish<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Jolla wanted to turn some heads with a their new Sailfish OS, preserving much of the MeeGo flow to keep purists happy, while adding enough new elements to ensure it has a future when pitted against the likes of the Android, iOS, and Windows Phone in today's smartphone world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any new OS, there's a fair amount of kinks that need to be ironed out, and Sailfish is not without its share of bugs. The most recent 1.0.1.12 version (at the time of this writing) squashed a huge amount of them and added a fair share of features, but it still carries the beta tag and we're sure Jolla will continue pumping out updates regularly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick video showing off the user interface in action:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlocking the phone with the dedicated power/lock button reveals the Sailfish lockscreen that displays the time, as well as any number of icons which indicate sound profiles, battery status, alarms, missed notifications, WiFi signal strength, and many more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the first things you'll notice on the Jolla is that it features no capacitive or on-screen navigation/contextual buttons like on Android, WP and iOS. Instead it relies almost entirely on gestures to navigate through the interface. Closing an app, for example, is done with a downward swipe from the top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An important distinction to remember in Saiflish is between a pull (a drag and hold on the screen) and a swipe (a drag and release).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Navigating from the lockscreen is generally vertical - a short pull down will reveal the date and "Pulley menu" containing various shortcuts, while the same pull up will show the battery level and network status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping up will bring you to Sailfish's one and only homescreen. Initially it will be populated only by a row of shortcuts at the bottom, but as you open and minimize apps, it will get tiled with dynamic thumbnailed "Covers." To minimize an open app into a cover at any time, simply swipe from the left or right edge of the screen inwards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Covers act not only as shortcuts to and from open apps, but also update dynamically based on their content. For instance, the Dialer cover will show you recent calls, while the Store cover will show you app download/update progress. You can have up to four large or nine smaller covers at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Closing any number of Covers can be done by a press-and-hold on any of them and hitting the 'X' icon that appears. You can close all running programs by pulling down from the center of the screen and selecting 'Close all'.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, you can tell apps what to do via their Covers without actually having to open them. Certain Covers will have small icons underneath that indicate actions that can be performed by swiping a Cover left or right. These are called active shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another swipe up from the homescreen will bring you to the app Launcher. The Launcher is where all of your apps are located, and can take up more than one vertically-scrollable screen depending on the number of apps you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top row of apps will also show up on your homescreen, and you can drag new shortcuts here for quick access (it's locked at 4 and there's no folder support).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're on the lockscreen, homescreen, or app menu you can quickly lock the device by swiping down from the top edge of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Events page can be accessed from at any time by swiping up from the bottom edge of the screen. This will show you missed calls and texts, as well as all sorts of social networking and update notifications. Rather un-intuitively, the Events page is not closed by reversing the opening upward swipe with a downward one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Certain apps and interfaces contain contextual menus (called Pulley menus in Sailfish), which are accessed with a downward pull from the center of the screen (not the top). To determine whether an app has a Pulley menu, simply look for an illuminated row along the top edge. We saw an example of this in the lockscreen above, where a pull down from the center reveals several shortcuts and a sound toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actual performance does take some getting used to, partly because of the early (and consequently buggy) OS build, but also as a result of the gesture-centric interface. You have to be careful where you originate your gestures from, as starting from outside the display will oftentimes result in a much different action than intended. Also, the difference between pulls and swipes add another level of complexity that you'll have to be mindful of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't say that it's a poor experience - overall it's quite interesting and nice, but some aspects of Sailfish OS are certainly less intuitive than others. With practice, some optimizations based on user input, and animation/sensitivity fixes of the UI elements, Sailfish has some real potential.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps include Android support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On install, the Jolla will ask you which of the core applications you would like to install on your device, and which to keep on their Store. This is a great way for you to keep applications you don't need off your device, as we all know well from other platforms how much of a pain bloatware can be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the Jolla only needs the Settings, Messaging, Phone, People, Browser, Camera, Store and Gallery apps to work. The "Jolla Essential apps" which you have the option of adding during startup (or anytime later from the Jolla app store) include Notes, Clock, Calendar, Media, Documents, Maps, Calculator, Mail, Microsoft Exchange, and Android Support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you may have noticed by that last one, Sailfish also provides support for installing Android applications, which is a great way of extending the capabilities of the Jolla smartphone. Jolla's own store currently supports about 70 apps, so incorporating the larger app selection of the Yandex app store (installed when you install Android support from the Jolla Store) or the Amazon app marketplace is a much needed and welcome bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Play is not currently supported by the Jolla smartphone, so you won't have official access to the "real" Android app store or Google's own apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you get the option to sideload .APKs as previously confirmed by Jolla. You need to use the beta file manager which is available as an optional download to open the packages for that to work.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Settings provide limited customization options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The settings screen can be accessed from the lockscreen Pulley menu, or through the dedicated Settings app. The main screen features toggles and shortcuts to a number of quick toggles of your choosing, underneath which are a pair of sliders for screen brightness and ringtone volume. Settings are divided into categories for system, apps, and user accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sailfish provides the standard amount of things you can do with your device, including connectivity options, sync and notifications, device lock, updates and more. It is, however, limited in terms of customization, allowing you only to adjust sounds, screen brightness, and timeout in the 'Look and feel' section. You can add a custom background "Ambience" image, which will automatically change the primary interface color as well, but that's about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accounts include your garden variety social networking profiles, as well as Google and XMPP standards. Adding an account will incorporate it into the Jolla's interface, enabling notifications and status updates to show up in your events page, as well as calendar events and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>App settings are also very well thought out, as a press on the Apps button will open up an overview of your Launcher interface with all of the apps with editable settings highlighted. This is a great way to see which apps have hidden settings and adjust them easily from one location.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Jolla's Gallery handles not only the images, but the videos and Ambience themes as well. It follows the general design guidelines and is a pretty simple affair. Upon opening the app you get a list albums - Photos, Videos and Ambiences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos is the actual image gallery. It is a scrollable list of thumbnails (15 per page), which you can tap to bring to fullscreen. There is no kind of filtering, not is there separation by date or location. The Sailfish gallery retains the MeeGo's looks completely. The only things you can do are select and delete images. Luckily there is Select All option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are displayed in full resolution and you can use only pinch gestures for zoom in and out. If you tap again on the image you'll get additional settings for sharing via Bluetooth, Email or social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google,). While you are in this view mode you can use the swipe down gesture to bring the advanced menu. There you can view picture details, use the picture to create a new Ambience, delete it or get editing options (crop, rotate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ambiences</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's talk Ambiences. The Ambience menu, just like the gallery, is a scrollable list of Ambience thumbnails. Here you can set favorite Ambiences (which will appear on the Ambiences quick selection screen), change the ringtone volume of the default Ambiences, set or remove Ambiences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have created a custom Ambience, once you set it as a favorite, in addition to the ringtone volume, you will be able to assign custom ringtones for calls, messages, chats, emails, calendar evens and alarms. You can create a new Ambience by opening an image from Photos and select the appropriate option from the advanced menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jolla doesn't have a dedicated video player, the Gallery handles the videos instead. The Video sections has the same simplistic view as Photos - it is another scrollable list of static thumbnails (maximum 15 per page).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player offers sharing of your videos, in much the same ways as the image gallery. It will even compress the videos for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video interface is really simple - you get just an auto-hiding scrubber at the bottom of the video. Tapping on the center pauses the video and it is the only way to actually use the scrubber. Tapping on either of the sides brings additional options for sharing via Bluetooth, Email, Facebook, Twitter and Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you swipe down the advanced menu will pop up with Delete and View Details options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated video player supports only MP4, MOV and MKV files up to 1080p resolution. DivX and XviD video codecs are not supported, neither is AC3 audio. The lack of those three means the video player is rather useless, unless you don't plan of doing lots of converting. We really hope Jolla addresses that with future updates. And while at it - subtitle support would be nice too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Simple music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The final bit of the Jolla's multimedia package is the nicely looking music player called Media. Its main screen holds Playlists, All Songs, Albums and Artists section shortcuts. Those sections are pretty much self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no Now Playing screen. Once you select a song, a pop-up will appear at the bottom of the screen housing the scrubber and the music controls. Below the music controls is the name of the now playing song, plus part of the names of the previous and next songs. You can swipe between those just like you would use the dedicated virtual keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe up this pop-up to reveal the hidden Add to Playlist, Shuffle and Repeat options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Jolla music player offers no equalizers, or the option to repeat a single song.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Jolla phone has an 8MP main camera with an LED flash and a 2MP front-facing camera. The main camera can record 1080p video @ 30fps. Those specs don't sound too impressive to the Android and Windows Phone crowd, but the iPhone 5s has basically the same specs. It's the image quality that counts, anyway so let's not rush to any conclusions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we get to that, let's talk camera interface. The camera can be launched from the lockscreen (pull down until you highlight "Camera" and release) or from a shortcut. The interface is pretty clean - just a virtual shutter key and row of indicators.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those indicators show the current settings and you can tap any one of them to bring up the settings overlay or use the pull down gesture that is standard across the rest of the UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is a camera mode - still or video. In video mode you also get a time indicator when you record. Flash can be set to auto, off or forced and there are a few white balance settings. In the lower right there's a front/back camera toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The autofocus option offers continuous autofocus, infinity (which is not good for close ups, but prevents unnecessary refocusing when shooting distant objects) and finally the traditional tap focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A gesture borrowed from Android allows you to swipe from the side to view captured images and videos. Just make sure you swipe in the right direction, because you might end up opening the settings instead or worse, exiting the camera. There's no swipe to delete though, you have to pull down and select delete, then wait out the 2 second timer (during which you can cancel).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no geo-tagging option and the photos we took were not geo-tagged. We'll dig into this issue further for the review, as the Jolla phone has an A-GPS, GLONASS-enabled receiver built-in so it should be possible to geo-tag photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing we missed are shooting modes - there's no HDR or panorama mode, for example, not even night mode. Note that by default the camera shoots 6MP 16:9 photos and you can't change that from the camera. You have to go into the Settings, then apps, then camera to change the aspect to 4:3 and gain the full resolution shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The several camera samples we took were in fairly poor weather, so we'll wait for clearer air to snap photos for the review. Even so, there are a few obvious flaws. The photo have a noticeable red/purple tint to them, though color rendering seems accurate. The exposure can use a little tweaking too as the Jolla phone tends to overexpose photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These should be easy enough to fix with a software update. The camera itself seems a decently capable 8MP shooter - not quite iPhone 5s levels, but it will be good enough after a few tweaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also shot a video too. The camera records at 1080p @ 30fps with 12Mbps bitrate. That's not very high for FullHD video, the iPhone 5s and Galaxy S4 do 17Mbps, for example, but we've also seen lower. Audio is captured in stereo at around 114Kbps bitrate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were disappointed by the front-facing camera, which only captures 720p video at 15fps despite its 2MP resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video itself looks good enough - again, it's not as sharp as the best of the best 1080p phone cameras out there, but it gets the job done. We'll take a closer look at the video quality in the full review. Until then, here's a video sample to gauge it for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the audio is garbled, even after we installed the latest update available. This problem isn't limited to just our unit either. Another issue we encountered is that the framerate drops significantly when shooting video in the dark, as low as 12-13fps. You can't turn on the LED light either, so low-light video recording is a no-go at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hopefully there will be a software update soon as this just doesn't work like a finished product should.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While the leading OSes of the day use button-based navigation to various degrees, the Nokia N9 pioneered the gesture-based interface. Sadly, the N9 fell victim to Nokia's Windows Phone transition, but a team of ex-employees kept the Maemo/MeeGo dreams alive by establishing Jolla.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jolla created its own fork of the Linux-based mobile OS. Tizen is another fork, but that's just vaporware for now, despite support from tech giants Samsung and Intel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we like what Jolla has done with the software - the gestures do take some getting used to (perhaps because the iOS and Android way of thinking is so ingrained in us) but once you do, they are simpler to use than BlackBerry OS 10's gestures. It doesn't feel like quite the finished product as there are some areas where the gestures are still lacking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Yandex and Amazon Android app stores is a quick way to bootstrap the app ecosystem as the native Jolla store is quite barren at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, even our quick encounter with the Jolla is enough to tell that the software isn't done. Some features are either buggy (e.g. the camera) or don't work as advertised (the Other Half still doesn't do all we were promised). Yes, Jolla doesn't hide that Sailfish is in beta, but charging people ?400 for a product and then using them as beta testers is no way to gain widespread appeal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of hardware, we suppose, the Jolla phone is good enough (we were hoping to see the Other Half concept expanded on). It has the specs of an Android or Windows Phone device half its price, but, it's a unique piece of tech that offers what no one else does - a Linux-powered phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linux may be the unseen core of Android, but a proper Linux phone does not - or rather did not - exist and some people have been waiting for ages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, never mind the chipset, the screen resolution, the camera, never mind that the Jolla phone in its current state is practically a prototype. This is a story of an underdog bringing us what we wanted, what the Nokia giant promised but didn't deliver. It's also a promise of a truly open platform - sure, Android is open sourced but Google is continuously tightening its iron grip and letting its Big Corp interests show.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Mozilla and Canonical are making much of the same promises though and at least Mozilla had the sense to start its Firefox OS at bargain basement prices. A ?400 phone with these specs and this software is an impossible sell to non-geeks. But with an ever-expanding geek market, securing it might be all Jolla needs to succeed.</paragraph>
