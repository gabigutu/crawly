			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has made some great entry-level Android phones, but it's been a while since we saw a new model. The Xperia M injects new blood into the segment with both single and dual-SIM options. Based on the trademark Xperia design, the M scores high on looks and build quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M shares many of the design features that made its Xperia Z sibling such a looker, including the signature power key. It also has a hardware shutter key along with a couple of other features that are becoming quite rare in the smartphone world - a removable battery and a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M also offers a relatively big and sharp screen, 4" FWVGA of 245ppi, and a dual-core Krait processor, plus 720p video capture with its 5MP camera. These are specs that can be hard to find in the Xperia M's price bracket. Most entry-level Androids either have Cortex-A9 CPUs (or A5/A7), or record only VGA video or have sub-WVGA screens, which is why entry-level Windows Phone handsets are such an enticing alternative in the price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony may have hit a spot that Samsung, LG and HTC haven't thoroughly covered, which bodes well for the young Xperia M. The optional dual-SIM is great too, since a good smartphone with a second SIM slot can prove harder to find than you would expect (with screen, camera and chipset considerations in mind).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M runs Android 4.1 with Sony's magic sprinkled over many of the apps, including a Walkman music player with a dazzling array of sound enhancement options, plus the Album and Movies apps, which have some unique media management skills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bold Purple and Yellow colors are a plus too, with an excellent, soft touch plastic on the back - a welcome break from black-or-white options and the prevailing glossy plastics. Hop over to the next page to see what's behind that back cover, as well as whether the screen and camera live up to the expectations and more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Xperia M<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M comes in an old-fashioned box - big and colorful - which contains the phone itself, the battery, a compact charger and a microUSB cable. A single-piece headset is also in the bundle (though our review unit came without the full set of accessories so we didn't have one).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M measures 124 x 62 x 9.3 mm and weighs 115g. Overall it's more compact than most Android phones we've encountered recently, though the screen bezel could've been thinner. For the sake of comparison, an iPhone 5 (also with a 4" 16:9 display) measures 123.8 x 58.6 x 7.6 mm and weighs 112g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M closely follows the design guidelines of the Xperia family, without being too similar (like the Galaxy line). It has the trademark round, metal power key (the so-called OmniBalance design), slightly recessed sides of contrasting material like on the Xperia Z, an RGB light below the screen and a shutter key. The end result is one very attractive phone, despite being low on the totem pole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front holds the 4" LCD screen, surrounded by relatively big bezels (especially top and bottom, considering there are no physical buttons). Even so, the Xperia M is not a large device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back has a slight curve like Xperias of the Sony Ericsson era. It's made of plastic that wraps around the sides of the phone, giving it a nice unibody impression, but is actually removable so you can access the battery and the card slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another plus about the back is the material - it's a matte plastic with a soft touch finish, making it very pleasant to the touch and fingerprint-resistsant (but can be a bit hard to clean once it inevitably gets smudgy in the end).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It all culminates in a great in-hand feel for the Xperia M - it's small and fits easily in the hand, the materials are pleasant and it's pretty light. At 9.3mm it's not the thinnest phone around but slips very easily into pockets and, again considering its price tag, the M is very well proportioned having an overall impression of a pricier phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M has a 4" LCD display of FWVGA resolution (480 x 854). That makes it relatively sharp at 245ppi. It's protected by a scratch-resistant glass of undisclosed make.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia M display under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendering looks okay, but the white balance is on the cold side meaning there is a subtle bluish tint. Typical for Sony smartphones, viewing angles are not impressive at all, with a visible loss of contrast and even a color shift when you are not looking at the phone head on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the overall image quality is okay, the biggest problem with the display is that it's not very bright. We kept it at almost full brightness most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front display glass is quite reflective too, making the screen hard to read in the sunlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Hardware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The earpiece is above the screen and to the left of it is the VGA front-facing camera, along with the proximity and ambient light sensors. Below the screen is the RGB notification light, which can use different colors to alert you to missed events and you can use the settings to customize the colors for different events. It's a bit too small for our liking, but works well enough even during the day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mic pinhole is also on the front, which makes it hard to accidentally cover with your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone is where all the physical buttons are - starting with the Power/Lock key (which looks good but is also big and easy to press), the volume rocker (which is also easy to use) and the shutter key. The shutter key was a bit of a disappointment as it doesn't provide a solid click, but it's still a great option to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and left sides of the Xperia M is where the two wired ports reside, one on each side. The 3.5mm audio jack is on top in the center and the microUSB port is on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lanyard eyelet is at the bottom of the phone and you have to open the back panel to put the strap in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the back cover is open, you can also access the 1,750mAh battery and the microSD card slot (which you'll probably rely heavily on as the Xperia M provides only about 2GB of user accessible storage). Also here you'll spot either one or two microSIM card compartments, depending on which version of the phone you got (we have the single-SIM version).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on the back is the 5MP camera with LED flash and the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes in Black, White, Purple and Yellow, but we should mention that the Yellow version is not available in dual-SIM flavor for some reason.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M battery isn't that big - a capacity of 1,750mAh is nothing to write home about, but the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini (also available in single and dual-SIM versions) has a 1,900mAh battery and the HTC One mini has a 1,800mAh and both are 4.3" phones. What we mean to say is, even though it may not be much, it's ok for its class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the Snapdragon chipset inside has proven to be very power efficient in other phones we've tested. Again, we're testing the single-SIM version of the Xperia M. The Xperia M dual would have a second set of radio internals so it may be more taxing on the battery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Jelly Bean user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M runs on Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean with Sony's customizations, which mostly stick to stock Android looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Xperia M in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen starts off with five panes but you can add and remove panes and even select one of them as home. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done with a tap-and-hold on a blank area of a homescreen or using the pinch zoom out gesture. A context menu appears, allowing you to perform various customizations on your phone - add widgets or shortcuts, change the wallpaper and the theme. You can also add shortcuts from the app drawer by holding your finger over an icon and dragging it across to the homescreen area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M has a few custom-made Sony widgets for various social services, connectivity toggles, the Walkman player, etc. Unfortunately, the widgets in the Xperia M do not resize or re-arrange automatically when you're trying to place them, even though Jelly Bean supports that feature natively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The wallpaper menu offers both static and live wallpapers. As usual you can preview the live wallpapers before applying them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a new theme changes the lock and home screen wallpapers and the color of the system icons (toggles, menu icons, etc.). Depending on the theme you've chosen, the LED strip below the screen will light up in matching color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the LED strip, it will light up to notify you of various events and you can customize the colors that are used too - you can select one of seven colors for Unread SMS, Missed call, Incoming SMS and Alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are five docked shortcuts (the app drawer shortcut and two on each of its sides). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has two shortcuts for quick access to the camera (swipe to left) and to the dedicated music controls (swipe right). The hardware shutter key actually makes the camera shortcut redundant - it will launch the camera even if the device is locked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the music player is active, the lockscreen will show the music controls by default, but you can hide them with a swipe if you want. You can also enable Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a few toggles switches (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Mobile Data). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is organized in pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. If you tap and hold on an app a green Add to Homescreen area will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon there and you will go back to your homescreens where you can put a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager of the Sony Xperia M shows a vertical list of thumbnails of all recent apps and serves as a launcher for Small apps. Small apps are floating apps that do not take up the whole screen, but instead float over other apps (this works a lot better on screens bigger than 4"). The default Small apps are Calculator, Timer, Notes, Sound recorder and Browser. Note that only one small app can run at a time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now at your command<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know if there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Xperia L gets activated with a press-and-hold-and-upward-swipe of the virtual Home button. You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M uses a Snapdragon S4 Plus chipset with two Krait cores clocked at 1GHz, 1GB RAM and Adreno 305 GPU. It's a chipset made popular by entry-level Windows Phone handsets but it is not that popular with Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Krait cores and Adreno 305 should have the advantage over dual and quad-core Cortex-A5 processors and their Adreno 203 companions that are the hardware of choice for phones like the Samsung Galaxy Core, the HTC Desire SV and Desire 600 dual sim.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single core performance is okay - higher than the Galaxy Core and Desire 600 dual sim even though their processors are clocked at 1.2GHz. Architecture plays a big role here, but so does clock speed - the dual-core Krait in the HTC One mini is at 1.4GHz and that results in a noticeable advantage in performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-threaded benchmark Linpack puts the Xperia M between last year's flagships, the Galaxy S III and HTC One X. It's also well ahead of the Desire 600 dual sim and double what the Galaxy Core did.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2, however, thinks the quad-core Desire 600 dual-sim is practically a match for the Xperia M, while the dual-core Galaxy Core lags behind again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's move on to the full system benchmarks. AnTuTu thinks the Desire 600 dual sim is as good as the HTC One mini and ahead of the Xperia M. Quadrant seems to agree and keep in mind the Desire is rendering graphics at qHD resolution rather than FWVGA like the Xperia M (that's about 26% more pixels). Still, the One mini is ahead but not by far in these two tests (it has a higher-res 720p screen to project images on, after all).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resolution doesn't come into play with GLBenchmark 2.5 and 2.7, both render at 1080p offscreen. The results of the Sony Xperia M are very close to those of the HTC One mini (which also uses Adreno 305), which leads us to believe the GPUs in both phones are running at the same clock speed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In real-world performance that results in a good but not perfect framerate in Epic Citadel (which is rendered by the phone at the screen's resolution). 53.2fps will be enough for current 3D games to run smoothly at High Quality, but future, heavier games might have to choose performance-oriented graphics settings. Still, the Xperia M is an entry-level phone and we don't even bother running these benchmarks on Adreno 203-powered devices, so that should tell you something. It may not be up there with the big boys, but it's no slouch either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good single-threaded performance should have resulted in good JavaScript performance, but that's not the case. The Xperia M is sandwiched between its dual-SIM adversaries, while higher-end minis are ahead. Windows Phone 8 devices that use the same chipset also beat the Xperia.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark 2 and Vellamo run more comprehensive browser benchmarks and give the Xperia M a slight edge.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, the Sony Xperia M has an advantage over quad-core Cortex-A5 phones in CPU performance and only a minor lead in web performance. It's the Adreno 305 that makes this chipset really worthwhile - it allows you to play 3D games that would otherwise be too graphic intensive for Adreno 203 phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M phonebook is integrated with the dialer using a tabbed interface - the Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs can be side-swiped. The bottom bar holds shortcuts to search option, add number field, and the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact list can be sorted by either first or last name. There are two contact search options - a dedicated search field at the bottom of the contact list, and an alphabetical scroll bar to jump to names starting with a specific letter on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a contact has accounts in multiple services, you can "link" their details to keep everything in one place. Their Facebook photos and interests (part of the Facebook integration) will show up as extra tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick contact feature is present alright - a tap on the contact's photo brings a pop-up windows with shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact, visiting their web page or navigating to their home address.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type). There's an Add field button and the X button lets you remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write the name down phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Custom ringtones are enabled too. This is where the LED strip comes into play as well. You can set a custom color for a contact, so the ambience light can serve as a caller ID of sorts. Of course you cannot have a different color for every single contact in your phonebook but you can have one color be for family, another for work calls and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia M was great. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation, so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is integrated in the dialer - it shows a list of recently dialed, received and missed calls in the top half of the screen and the keypad in the bottom half. Once you start typing, the call log is replaced by the smart dial list which searches for matches in both the contacts' phones and names. You can hide the keypad to make more room for the call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity and accelerometer sensors, the Sony Xperia M automatically disables the touchscreen when you lift it up during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M scored a Good mark on our loudspeaker tests, meaning you shouldn't miss any notifications unless you use a really quiet ringtone. Sony has preloaded a number of features that modify how the speaker sounds. We tested with all of them off, then with xLOUD on, which noticeably made the sound louder, and then with both xLOUD and ClearPhase on, which sacrificed some of the loudness for improved audio quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more on the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Each thread is displayed as an IM chat session, with the most recent message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them against deletion. Search is enabled to locate a specific message in all conversations and you can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message into an MMS. Four shortcuts at the bottom of the screen handle the most common cases - an image, a photo, a doodle (you draw with your finger) and your location. This, however, takes an extra row from the screen, which isn't too big to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk. A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox for all your email accounts. It supports batch operations and has a Preview pane option in landscape mode - the list of emails goes on the left, the contents of the currently selected email on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Hangouts is the default app that handles instant messaging (Facebook is preinstalled, but Facebook Messenger isn't).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia M offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. Typing on the portrait keyboard is fairly comfortable, but after using 4.5+ inch phones it's starting to feel a little cramped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape gives you even bigger, easier to press buttons. There's also the added feature of being able to customize the keyboard. You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller, either with a pinch gesture or a sideways swipe. The whole thing is very responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids in a nifty animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a second tab here, My Albums, which includes online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa) along with albums stored on devices in the local network. Also here are some special albums - Maps and Globe, which use the geo-tagging info to display photos where they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slide show using the SensMe brand and much like the music player feature, this one scans files and groups similar photos together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the LED strip below the display lights up with different color (similar with the image on the screen) every time you scroll through the pictures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player has good UI, poor codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI, reminiscent of HTPC interfaces. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the video player's capabilities are pretty poor. It refused to play any 1080p videos and 720p DivX/XviD were also a no-go. 720p MKV files did work, but there's no DTS or AC3 support (which is what most MKV files have). There are as many sound enhancements here as there are for the music player, but with no support for high-quality audio codecs, it's wasted. There's no subtitle support either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download a more capable app from the Play Store, but then you lose the Gracenote features - the Movies app always plays videos (or tries to, anyway) with its own player rather than what you've set as system default. We tried BS Player and it worked, but 1080p videos were choppy (in software decoding mode, hardware decoding failed). 720p videos worked okay, but the sound issue persisted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player, which we first saw on the late-2012 Sony Xperia smartphones is also on board. It offers the same cool interface as before, but this time it has more options for sound enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's a new ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD enhances the loudness of the internal speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However dedicated audiophiles might want to consider alternatives off the Play Store, with support for a 10 or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are music controls on the lockscreen. Swiping them to either side brings back the clock. The notification area also offers the now playing screen with music controls and the option to jump into the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RGB notification light below the screen will change to match the album art of the currently playing song (you can disable this if you don't like it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Play Music is on board as well. It features the Listen Now feature, which tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen uses the song album art and gives you a quick shortcut to the rest of the artist's songs along with the play controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Buggy FM radio with some neat tricks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook. Disappointedly, we found that one of the visualizations and TrackID crash the whole phone from time to time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output clean but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M performed excellently in the first part of our traditional audio quality test posting some great scores in all parts. Unfortunately its volume levels are well below average, which prevents us from giving it full points.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's very little degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones. Except for the slightly worsened stereo crosstalk, the added resitance to the line out has virtually no impact. Volume levels remain pretty low, though, so while the overall output is one of the cleanest we have seen, it's not quite the perfect showing by the Xperia M.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP camera does not impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera that can produce still shots with a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes and is unified with the camcorder one - you can start snapping away or shoot a video without the need to change modes. The right one holds four virtual buttons - a shortcut to the gallery, video and still shot shutter keys, and a primary/secondary camera toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get the shooting mode selection key in the top corner, followed by three customizable shortcuts. The final shortcut here opens the drawer with all available settings for the given shooting mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Sony Xperia M camera offers all kinds of features, including HDR mode, Sweep panorama face detection, geo-tagging and touch capture. Scenes and picture effects are available too. The effects split the screen into nine segments and show a live preview of each of the nine effects, but it's a little laggy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the home-baked quick launch mode, which lets you select what the camera shortcut on the lockscreen does. You can go for simply launching the camera in either still or movie mode, or you can set it to immediately snap a photo/start capturing video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This might come in handy for those occasions when you are worried that you might miss a shot, but it is also useful for when you don't want to waste your battery keeping the camera interface constantly going (it's a real battery hog).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has an auto upload option, but that only works with Sony's own PlayMemories Online service. You can set it to upload only over Wi-Fi and only while charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Sony Xperia M photos is not that good. The dynamic range is low and the photos often have their highlights blown out even when the image appears underexposed. Colors are not great either with white balance visibly off most of the time - and it's not consistent, we saw blue tint, yellow tint even green tint. There is a lens issue with our unit too, with visible corner softness on the left. All that said, the amount of fine detail looks okay for a 5MP camera, but the overall results are not great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode is available too, helping you bring extra dynamic range to both the shadows and highlight areas of your shot. It messes up the colors further and reduces the contrast noticeably.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p video is high on bitrate, low on quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M is capable of capturing 720p video footage at 30fps, same as the 8MP camera of the Xperia L. However, there's no HDR mode for the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came as a disappointment for us is the fact that even though the Xperia M is able to capture still shots while recording video, it only produces images at VGA resolution - which is a third of the resolution of the video, making it quite pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More crucially though, Sony Xperia M just doesn't record good video (the L didn't either). The clips shot with it look like upsized VGA footage as they lack detail and look all pixelated with heavy oversharpening halos. Colors are okay and framerate is steady at 30fps, but the lack of detail really ruins the whole experience. The continuous autofocus feature triggered too often too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely enough videos have more than enough bitrate at about 17Mbps mark (the L did 12Mbps!), so you can't really blame it on compression. The whole thing is a waste of storage though, 17Mbps could fit 1080p video, let alone that the quality suggest something closer to 5Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that the video sound is recorded in stereo at a 96Kbps bitrate, which is just enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M has quad-band 2G and up to quad-band 3G connectivity depending on your regional model. Mobile data speeds can hit the impressive 21 Mbps of HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP and ANT+, both of which can be used for low-power accessories (e.g. sports trackers), and NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and PC connectivity, and there's also USB On-the-go so you can attach external flash drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Media Remote isn't preinstalled on the Xperia M but you can get it off the Google Play Store for free. It will serve as a remote control for DLNA-capable BRAVIA TVs and Sony DVD/Blu-ray players too. There are a few versions of the interface ranging from simply changing the channels to mouse input and viewing disc history. This sort of a remote only works over the Wi-Fi connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia M comes with Sony's Smart Connect app, which replaces the former LiveWare manager, although the functionality remains basically the same. With Smart connect, you can set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger, or at a preset time. It doesn't work with NFC though, which is very disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, there's no app to handle the NFC functions out of the box, which is strange considering Sony took the time to install a QR code reader app, which will see a lot less use. Luckily, there are plenty of capable NFC apps in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's Xperia Link, which shares the phone's Internet connection over Bluetooth instead of Wi-Fi. All you have to do is use the camera to scan the QR code generated by the app on the tablet or computer. If you have the Xperia Tablet Z, the app will also display notifications for incoming calls and show full text messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is the sole web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. The minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A brand new setting is called Reduce data usage and does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone. You can check the graph to see how much data you've saved. Unlike Opera Mini, this mode keeps the full functionality of web pages. Also, secure connections bypass the Google servers, for privacy reasons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, keep in mind you can use the Small app browser, but that doesn't work that great on a 4" screen. Plus there's no easy way to switch from Chrome to the floating browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M comes with the older version OfficeSuite 7 viewer. OfficeSuite 7 lets you view Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF along with plain text files. Just view them though, you'll have to buy the Pro version if you want editing capabilities as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar also pulls info on upcoming events from your Facebook account. Facebook events appear just like regular calendar entries, except that you can't edit them from the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Notes app that comes with the Xperia M. It's pretty simple to use - you can select the color of the note and just start typing or doodling. There's also Evernote integration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a nicely touch-optimized calculator aboard. The buttons are really big and easy to hit, and it also offers advanced functions (trigonometry, logarithms).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. There's also a desk clock option, although it doesn't have integrated weather or news information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch, world clock and timer are available within the clock app. The Timer function now has a history option, and the world clock features a cool slider which helps you quickly figure out the local time in another city.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver setting helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold, turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off the mobile data when the screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage (you shouldn't as it's too small), a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup system and downloaded apps and their data along with media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another helpful tool is the Update center, which checks for updates for your phone and your apps. You can enable automatic download with the option to use Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M also comes with Google+ and Facebook apps out of the box. The Facebook app also has a nice widget that will show you updates on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This being a Sony phone, you can install PlayStation Mobile for Android to play exclusive games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has all the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. You can also check out the Play Picks, Apps to Watch, Apps Highlights and Editor's Choice categories on the Home tab for more curated app lists. The Recommended for you list is based on what apps you've installed and what your Google+ friends have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M has a built-in A-GPS receiver with GLONASS support, which managed to get a lock in about a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is one of the most useful features in Maps as it lets you see your destination so you don't have to look around for the exact building when you arrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has had some very strong contenders at the entry level: the Xperia U was the cheapest dual-core you can get for a long time and the M is its spiritual successor. Most phones in this price range have Cortex-A5/A7 chipsets and can't shoot 720p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia M has a lot going for it - attractive design, compact size and good build, and a reasonably powerful chipset for the class. The uninspiring screen and subpar camera will hold it back, but with a dual-SIM option it should still be able to do well in emerging markets where WP8 handsets like the Lumia 520 are on the rise since they beat the low-end Androids in terms of specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even in developed markets, there's a place for the Xperia M. Phones grow bigger every year and instead of getting cheaper, manufacturers tack on new (often unneeded) features to keep them at the same price. The Sony Xperia M is at the point where it's good enough for daily use (we're talking regular users here, not geeks who drool over core count and screen resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia family has two members that are closely related to the M. The Sony Xperia L has a bigger screen (4.3" FWVGA), an 8MP camera with 720p video, more built-in storage (8GB) but it has the same battery capacity, lacks LTE and a dual-SIM version. At the moment it costs about the same, which is why we expect the Xperia M to quickly get cheaper and become more attractive than the L.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia L</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C is a dual-SIM phone too, but with a 5" qHD screen (220ppi), a quad-core Mediatek chipset (1.2GHz Cortex-A7, PowerVR SGX544 GPU), an 8MP camera with 1080p video recording and a 2,390mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia C</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, the best alternatives for the Xperia M outside the Sony lineup come from the Windows Phone 8 family tree. The Nokia Lumia 620 matches most of the specs of the M, but adds goodies like free satellite navigation for one country, 8GB of expandable storage, Nokia Music and its 5MP camera shoots better 720p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 8S has great build quality, packs a 1,700mAh battery, Beats Audio and, while it only offers 4GB of expandable storage, boasts a 4" screen against the 3.8-incher of the 620. Both are cheaper than the M.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia Lumia 620 ? HTC Windows Phone 8S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We started off with WP8 handsets, because other alternatives from well-known makers are either pricy or have their flaws.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 for example is a fine phone with a dual-SIM version and optional LTE (single-SIM only), but it has an old Cortex-A9 chipset by Broadcom, fails at 720p video and is a good deal more expensive (we're talking 50+ euro). The LTE version has a 1,800mAh battery, but the others have only 1,500mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Ace 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's a bunch of phones, each priced around the same as the Xperia M, with a dual-SIM option, 4.3" WVGA screen (217ppi), dual-core Cortex-A5 processors and Adreno 203 GPUs, expandable storage and no 720p video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Core is the only one of the three with 1GB of RAM and 8 gigs of storage. It's also the only one with a 5MP camera. The LG Optimus L7 II and HTC Desire SV both have 8MP cameras and 4GB of storage. The Optimus L7 II packs a beefy 2,460mAh battery. The Desire SV comes in dual-SIM flavor only and it's the most expensive of the bunch (pricier than the Xperia M too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy Core I8260 ? LG Optimus L7 II P710 ? HTC Desire SV</paragraph>
			<paragraph>See what we mean? In this price range and level of equipment, you get low-power chipsets, no 720p video capture (not that the Xperia M is a star in this category, but still), mostly no NFC (besides the Lumia 620 and the LTE version of the Ace 3) and better specs like LTE, 8MP cameras or bigger batteries are rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we wish Sony had put a little more effort into tweaking the camera software or spent a little extra on a brighter screen, the Xperia M has all the potential to become a smart buy for the budget-conscious. Just wait a little while as right now it's priced the same as the Xperia L, which doesn't make much sense. What it means though is that a price drop is as good as inevitable.</paragraph>
