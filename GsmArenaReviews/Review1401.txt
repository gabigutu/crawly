			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There?s no such thing as a small WP 7 phone. However, 4.3 inches of screen estate are really something else. The best case scenario: the HTC HD7 is the phone you?ve been waiting for. The worst case scenario: it?s too big to fail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD7 was inevitable. Was it not the first Windows Phone 7 ever rumored? And rightly so. There?s no phone too big or too powerful for Windows Phone 7. In fact, if you ask Microsoft they?d say the bigger the better. HTC ? on their part ? didn?t have to think too hard. They simply skipped right to number seven.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Come to think of it, it may as well have been exactly with the HTC HD2 in mind that Microsoft laid down the law about the Windows Phone 7 required hardware. Effectively, HTC had a Windows Phone 7 flagship on standby for nearly a year ? waiting for as much as a nod from Microsoft to let it off the leash. Anyway, as we?ve seen on a number of occasions, this whole thing is about getting things done on the biggest mobile screen possible. And the HTC HD7?s best course of action is to ensure no surprises.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WP7-specific limitations<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alright, one thing we can be sure of ? the HTC HD7 is playing strictly by the Microsoft book in terms of hardware. On the other hand, it does look like a simple copy/paste job. You know, WP7 phones have a hard time demonstrating a personality. The HD7 has the extra task of identifying itself as something different from the HD2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brand new OS is the right place to start. In terms of hardware, the kickstand is certainly an eye-catcher ? not to mention it tells you?re dealing with a phone that will keep you entertained. Next on the list is the HTC Hub and the exclusive apps it offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It still seems the HTC HD7 offers little in the way of creativity. It will be up to the other WP7 phones in the HTC portfolio to do that. The HD7 might just be supposed to be a mere display of power ? the one that completes their grand slam of massive screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are still with us, you?re welcome on the next page where we start with the hardware.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC HD7 unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the HTC HD7 has pretty standard contents: a USB charger and a standard microUSB cable. There?s a one-piece headset with music controls and a manual on both mini-CD and in paper-copy. The supplied headphones aren't your only option ? the HD7 has a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC HD7 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We guess we just need to say it again. Although it looks like a screen this size has raised usability questions, the phone is perfectly manageable ? and the use of space deserves credit. The bezel around the screen is remarkably thin and the slim waistline does well to make the height and width of the handset acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD7 measures at 122 x 68 x 11.2 mm and weighs 162 grams ? we?ve been there already with the Desire HD. This is by no mans a small phone but the screen estate you get is worth it. Not least, it?s the traditional solid build we?ve come to expect form HTC.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It is a big and heavy phone but one that feels solid and durable. The screen? Well, any bigger and we?re talking tablet. The best thing ? and that?s no news by now ? the whole package handles comfortably enough. So let?s skip right to the kickstand ? after all, it?s what makes the difference from the HD2 and the Desire HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, it?s the only piece of metal on the phone ? tipping the scales at 162g already, we don?t think any more is needed. The kickstand is another example of good use of space no the HTC HD7. It folds nicely around the camera deck at the rear. The whole thing has ornamental value too. The chrome kickstand is a nice accent matched by a thin strip further down the rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera deck itself (housing the lens, dual LEDs and loudspeaker) is flashy yellow ? the same color we?ve seen on the internals of some recent HTC phones. With the kickstand folded into place, very little of it is visible ? only enough to be a discreet accent. The matt plastic at the rear is reasonably fingerprint-proof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s nearly all-screen up front and it looks good. That?s in terms of sheer size though it isn?t great to look at ? for image quality. It?s a regular LCD but that?s not what we?re complaining about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To start on a positive note, we have no issues with sensitivity ? the capacitive unit has great response and silky smooth, precise performance. Watching videos and browsing, and reading text, are all nice and comfortable on a screen that size and resolution. The viewing angles and sunlight legibility are passable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s the subpar contrast, subdued saturation and surprisingly weak brightness that we?re not happy with. The screen falls obviously short of Super AMOLEDs and the iPhone?s LCD ? no doubt about that. But it?s also certain that the image quality is inferior to that of phones like the LG Optimus 7 and even the very own HTC Trophy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And as if this is not enough ? the HD7?s screen has another problem. Its response time is really poor and that?s most prominent when scrolling listed menus. You?ll notice it in the launcher where some kind of ghosting causes the text labels of the menu items to fade away while you scroll. The same happens elsewhere in the interface where you need to deal with lists. Quite surprisingly, this is less noticeable in the browser (as you?re scrolling or zooming in on text) or the image gallery. That?s what counts after all, but the unpleasant effect in the main menu (and video player, too) is nevertheless hard to ignore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above and below the display glass there are two long and thin grills which can easily be mistaken for stereo speakers. They?re not ? we regret to say. They have no purpose at all other than getting annoying amounts of dust ? which is nearly impossible to clean at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display you will only find the earpiece and a status LED, as well as ambient light and proximity sensors, all embedded beneath the grill. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen we find the typical Windows Phone 7 controls ? Back, Start and Search. They?re all capacitive keys with excellent sensitivity and haptic feedback. Pressing and holding the middle Start key will activate Voice Commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right-hand side of the device hosts the volume rocker and the dedicated camera key. The volume rocker is a thin button that?s quite stiff and with such low stroke there?s almost no confirmation of a press being registered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated camera key is also small and thin, but its feedback is much better. It has a different problem though. Because of the peculiar design of the rear panel, the shutter key is closer to the middle than it should be. Being away from the natural position of the index finger ? in landscape hold ? it?s hard to reach and press comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing of note on the left side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing to at the top is the Power/Lock key, which is thin but prominent enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the phone features the microUSB port, the mouthpiece and the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the rear of the HTC HD7 is the 5 megapixel camera lens, stuck between the loudspeaker grill and the dual LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens is centrally placed and it?s still the natural place for your index finger to rest when holding the phone during calls. There?s no lens protection ? except for a slight embedding ? even carrying it in your pocket you risk getting it scratched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are only two positions for the kickstand and you can?t fix it between fully-open and folded. It?s spring-assisted and generally provides solid enough support for the phone. The thing is, the lack of front-facing loudspeakers is felt when you use the kickstand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the SIM bed and the 1230 mAh battery. It is quoted at 320 hours of stand-by and five hours and twenty minutes of talks in a 3G network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD7 is a solid and generally well-built phone. Most of the HD7 is high quality matt black plastic, but there is some metal too ? on the kickstand, which doubles as a camera plating. Good use of space make the otherwise big set comfortable enough to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen size is an obvious advantage ? though it?s not necessarily how you might feel about it. We think HTC did a great job of building the phone around the 4.3? screen but failed miserably in picking a decent screen in the first place. If you?re uncertain, the best thing would be to give the phone a try before buying it. And make sure you like what you see ? the image quality issues are so easily noticeable that it made us even wonder if it?s not our unit to blame though we snatched it off the retail network.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Flexible homescreen with Live tiles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The software part of Windows Phone 7 reviews feels like a book you?ve read ? that?s because all WP7 phones run the exact same software, with just a couple of preinstalled apps that make some difference. So don?t get surprised that we?ve reused some texts from our previous Windows Phone 7 reviews (including our dedicated WP7 review). We want you to be sure that even when we reuse portions of the texts, we always take care to check our facts with the review unit thoroughly. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, October 7, 2011: The Windows Phone 7.5 update is out and it brings new functionality and resolves some of the issues that we've mentioned in this review. Check out our Windows Phone 7.5 review here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC fans will be disappointed to find out that the Taiwanese company wasn?t allowed to do a complete UI makeover like they have on other platforms, but still they managed to give the HD7 that trademark HTC feel. The HTC Hub has the familiar clock and a few other apps that wouldn?t look out of place in a Sense UI environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC added apps include Stocks, Photo Enhancer, Converter, Connection Setup and Sound Enhancer. They are all full of eye candy and fancy animations. A few more apps are available in the HTC Hub too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go into details, here?s a video of the HTC HD7 and the Windows Phone 7 interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old Today screen is gone and it has been replaced with a set of Live tiles. It?s one of the most flexible homescreens we?ve seen. You?ll notice just how many useful things you can put on it as this review goes on. The iconic Start menu has gone too and there?s no trace of the honeycomb pattern either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone 7 Metro UI has two main parts that live side by side ? the homescreen (referred to as ?Start?) and the main menu. You can switch between the two by sideways swipes or using the arrow button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is a grid of Live tiles. Live tiles fit the broad concept of ?widget? but, unlike most widgets out there, are very uniform with clear labels of what each of them does. They display info (e.g. number of messages, the date) and are also the Windows Phone 7 equivalent of homescreen shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color theme of the interface is customizable ? the background can be either dark or light and there?s a long list of accent colors (the fill color of the tiles).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is a traditional list ? this is where all the hubs and installed apps are listed in alphabetical order. A press and hold reveals a context menu, which lets you ?pin? items to the homescreen (that is put their Live tile there), uninstall them or rate and review an app that you?ve downloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no folders in the main menu ? so the more apps you install, the longer the list will get. So, finding apps that you chose not to pin to the homescreen may involve plenty of scrolling. The list is alphabetical, so at least you?ll know where to look (an alphabet scroll would have been useful here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is quite simple ? sideways swipes navigate a sort of tabbed interface and there are on-screen soft keys. This will cover the most commonly used features, but for advanced features you can tap the ?...? symbol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It opens an extended context menu (and also reveals a label under each soft key, if the icon wasn?t revealing enough). Pressing and holding on an item in a list (e.g. a single message) will reveal a context menu relevant to that item only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What Windows Phone 7 has lost since the 6th iteration is multitasking. It handles a lot like a pre-version-4 iOS. The Start key (the one with the Windows logo) will get you out of the app and on the homescreen. Alternatively, you can exit an app using the Back key. That gets you back to the app last used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That last app will continue from exactly the same point from where you left it. Getting back into an app is done by tapping its live tile or shortcut in the menu or by using the back button, which returns to the previous screen (even if it was from a completely different app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, lack of multitasking means you can?t, say, run third party music players (e.g. last.fm) in the background. Apps also get suspended when you lock the screen ? however, there?s the option to allow them to run with a locked screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft will lift that restriction, but only for the apps that prove battery-efficient ? the phone must be able to work at least 6 hours with the app running if it?s a music player and 120 hours otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, all the other apps get suspended when you lock the phone ? unlocking the phone will cause the app or game to reload, which can be slow and you usually lose your progress. This can be very annoying to even casual gamers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no ?recently used? type of list to make going back to the app you need easier ? so you might have to search for it in the main menu or keep hitting the Back button until you see it. So, multitasking is not a complete loss, but not quite as comfortable as true multitasking OSes either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook tightly integrates with Facebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People hub assumes the responsibilities of the phonebook, though calling it a ?phonebook? is not very accurate. Instead of contacts, you have people with profiles ? a term borrowed straight out of the social networking domain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends ? everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap on any one of those letter boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to skip directly to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and they can be displayed as ?First Last? or ?Last, First? (the two settings are separate), you can also include or exclude Facebook friends, import only Facebook contacts that have a phone number and add several accounts to sync with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side shows only new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recently called contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact?s profile shows the contact photo. Below that there are actions ? ?call mobile?, ?text mobile?, ?write on wall?, ?view website? and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings up the ?What?s new? panel, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you can add multiple phone numbers and email addresses of different types (home, work, etc), a custom ringtone, a note or a variety of different fields (like birthday, website, office location and so on).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony lacks smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call sound of the HTC HD7 was loud and clear. Signal reception was decent but in areas with weak signal it dropped the call more often than not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also note that the HD7 is susceptible to the infamous ?antenna death grip?. At most, we managed to knock off two of the five bars but we couldn?t make it completely lose the signal (even when we wrapped our hands all over it). Still, it happens when you hold it normally too, so this is something to watch out for in areas of poor coverage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets ? a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead ? the HD7 did fairly well recognizing our commands, though it did have issues separating the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name of Mandark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist ? it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What?s missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone ? a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly for a fee).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an incoming call, the contact?s photo will appear full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note ? status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD7 scored a Good mark in our traditional loudspeaker performance test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Good messaging capabilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of Windows Phone 7 uses threaded view to organize your messages. When you start the app, you?ll see a list of conversations ? each one consists of multiple messages displayed as speech bubbles, which are ordered by the time they were sent/received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An empty speech bubble will hang at the bottom waiting for you to type a response. A message can have multiple recipients too by using the + button next to the recipient field. Just the first few letters of the contact?s name are needed ? the search feature will find it for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can attach a photo to turn the message into an MMS ? either an existing photo or you can snap one on the fly. You can add only one though and you can only attach photos (not videos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email app is pretty good. It easily retrieved the settings for our Gmail and Hotmail test accounts. Each inbox is separate and you can pin it to the homescreen, though there?s no aggregated inbox view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to display all, unread or flagged messages ? by sweeps to the side and you can browse all folders for the email account and batch operations are easy ? a tap on the left side of the screen selects the message, so you can move it, mark it as (un)read or flag it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each message can be flagged, which is a great way to sort only the emails that are important right now ? just tap the ?toggle flag? option from the context menu when you?re done with them and they are off the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried emailing a photo from HD7?s camera, but the email app downscaled it before sending ? so, emailing full resolution shots is a no go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big screen means bigger virtual keys but the thin bezel around the screen makes it a bit uncomfortable to hit the leftmost and rightmost keys. It?s no big deal though and with a little practice you?ll start typing fast and error free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The spell correction also helps a lot here. It turned out to be very accurate and the overall experience was so positive that even heavy texters should be satisfied.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery, kickstand but where?s the slideshow?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub is the photo gallery of Windows Phone 7. When you start it, it shows the most recent photos (including those from the camera), What?s new (which shows photos from online services) and a menu, which lets you view all photos, photos sorted by date and your favorite photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing an individual photo supports pinch zooming and you can easily upload the photo to Facebook or share it on some other service. There?s an option to automatically strip geo-tagging information before uploading it to online services ? that way your offline album will still be geo-tagged, but you won?t have to worry about privacy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub will automatically pull photos from your SkyDrive, Windows Live and Facebook accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have some issues with the WP7 gallery. With a kickstand and a large 4.3? screen, the HTC HD7 would have made an excellent makeshift picture frame. The biggest issues is that there?s no slideshow option ? a basic option of galleries on all phones we?re so used to seeing that we were confused when we couldn?t find it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also doesn?t have a landscape mode for the thumbnail view ? sure, you can zoom out from a photo into a film strip view but still, for a phone that will likely spend a lot of time in landscape mode this is an annoying omission.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app can probably substitute the gallery and offer both landscape mode and slideshows, but it?s really something that should be part of the native app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we?ve had no issues with speed ? Microsoft?s minimum spec requirement guarantees that even 5MP photos are handled without a snag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even so, Microsoft has decided to downscale photos when they are transferred from a computer to the phone using the Zune software (much like emailing a photo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the HTC provided apps ? Photo Enhancer ? can be used to add a bit of flare to photos. It?s a really basic app, you just open a photo and select an effect: Auto enhance, Cinnamon, High contrast, Sepia, Overexposed, Glimmer, Twilight, Vintage, Antique and a few more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, you can apply a few of these effects in the camera itself, but with Photo Enhancer you get to keep both the untarnished original and the modified photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Zune music player plus Dolby and SRS enhancements<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music and video players are simple and have straightforward interfaces. You won?t have any difficulties using them. However there are some things missing, like equalizers. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger ? you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the album art temporarily reveals three buttons ? repeat, favorite and shuffle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The players can of course work in the background and there?s another nice shortcut ? when you press a volume key, the name of the currently playing track also appears along with play/pause, next and previous buttons (they can also scrub through the song).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen ? like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best preloaded apps by HTC is the Sound Enhancer. It can apply sound enhancements to both songs and videos ? there are two separate settings, so the music enhancement you choose won?t affect videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can enable either Dolby Mobile or SRS enhancement and for music you get an equalizer too. It doesn?t support custom presets though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Watching videos excites and disappoints at the same time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The large 4.3? screen with nearly widescreen aspect (it?s 15:9) makes the HD7 a good platform for movie and TV show fans. It?s even better because of the Zune Marketplace, which is a great source for buying or renting movies and TV shows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The kickstand means you don?t have to hold the phone during the movie or episode ? which is great since holding the phone for even 45 minutes (the typical runtime for a 1 hour TV show) can be tiring and awkward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the picture gallery, viewing the list of videos can be done in portrait orientation mode only. The video player on the other hand is fixed to landscape only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another gripe we have with the HTC HD7 video watching experience is that the loudspeaker is on the back so the sound is actually directed away from you. Stereo speakers around the display on the front would have been a much better option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another problem is that the screen is not well-equipped for action scenes ? the unpleasant ghosting effect we already mentioned is visible and spoils the experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD7 has no AVI or DivX/XviD support, just MP4 and WMV. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert unsupported video files to .WMV (up to WVGA res). You can watch those formats on the HD7, it?s just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer configuration).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos from the Zune Marketplace come in the correct format so they might be the easier option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD7 also has a built in FM radio with a dead simple interface. You have the current frequency in very large digits ? swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD7 did very well in our audio quality test. There are no notable flaws when you use it with an active external amplifier - the frequency response is great and so are the noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings. The total harmonic distortion is pretty low too and generally the intermodulation distortion is the only thing about the HD7 ouput that was not particularly impressive (though it's still acceptable).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you could expect things get a bit worse when you plug in a pair of headphones, but the HD7 still maintains a very good performance. As a matter of fact the degradation is so subtle that the device ranks higher up in this scenario, than in the previous. The stereo crosstalk increases and that's about that. There's no extra intermodulation distortion or ferquency response deviations. Now add the fact that the HD7 is pretty loud too and you get the idea that the HD7 is a pretty good music player indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and see for yourself.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A decent 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD7 has a 5MP autofocus camera with dual-LED flash that snaps photos with maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple ? you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy trick for checking out the last few photos is that a side slide to the right opens the last picture shot and a slide to the left brings back the camera's live view instantly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended settings menu offers control over resolution, metering mode and flicker adjustment and also effects (fewer than the Photo Enhancer effects) and also Scenes presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is not particularly comfortable. It?s too near the center of the right side of the HD7, so you can?t hold the phone by both ends and reach the shutter. You have to move your right hand to the left and obscure a part of the viewfinder or use some other awkward solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good thing is the shutter key can wake the phone with a single press ? that is unlock it and start the camera. But that feature cleverly doesn?t trigger if there?s something in front of the proximity sensor ? like the insides of your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera performance is noticeably better than the Trophy camera but that?s not saying much. The noise levels are lower and there?s less work for the noise reduction, so there?s a decent amount of detail left in the photo. There?s still some smearing though and oversharpening artifacts too. Color balance tended towards yellow too (but it?s how Joe Public prefers it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples so you can judge yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-LED flash is good at short distances and you can even try shooting at medium distances. Low-light shooting is hindered by how the flash works ? it doesn?t light up when the phone is focusing (even in complete darkness) and only fires when taking the photo. The camera managed to focus most of the time with just this one flash but you?ll have a very tough time framing the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a 720p video sample from our new test setup. Pay attention to the second half of the video where we lower the light to show you how the the camcorder performs in more challenging conditions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera does 720p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the two LEDs as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can record in three resolutions: QVGA, VGA or 720p. The camera defaults to VGA, which is frustrating ? if you forget to set it to 720p, the videos you thought were shot in HD will be at the much less impressive VGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recorder does a decent job. There?s not much fine detail in the frames though and we suspect upscaling might have a role to play (note the jaggies on the thin branches). There is a slight stutter when things start moving too fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an HTC HD7 video sample: 720p@25fps.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity lacks Mass storage unless you hack it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD7 has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and dual-band 3G with HSPA (7.2Mbps downlink and 2Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP. Bluetooth is currently limited as to what it can do ? there?s no file transfer support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing with a computer is done with the Zune computer application. It?s the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your HD7 ? Windows Phone 7 doesn?t support Mass storage mode. Zune supports syncing over USB and Wi-Fi. There?s a Mac version of Zune in the works too. You can check our detailed review of the Zune software here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a registry hack that enables Mass storage, which is relatively easy (you need to change 3 values in the registry) and since the WP7 internal folder structure is fairly straightforward you can easily browse for content. Anything you put on it, won?t be recognized by the phone itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another syncing option is the cloud. SkyDrive is a free Microsoft service that gives you 25GB of cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great browsing experience would have been better with Silverlight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Internet Explorer on Windows Phone 7 is the best mobile IE yet. But that doesn?t do it justice ? it?s actually a huge leap forward compared to version 6. Coupled with the big screen of the HTC HD7, it will make you think twice before buying a tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Page rendering is perfect and fast, as are panning and scrolling. For zoom, you have double tap and pinch zoom. As an extra guide for navigation there?s the Find on page option. Flipping the phone in landscape orientation clears the onscreen controls and gives the whole screen to the webpage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser can handle up to 6 tabs open at once. It?s a reasonable limit for a mobile device, but tab-lovers might be disappointed. Anyway, even with 6 tabs open the HTC HD7 zipped through webpages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>History and favorites are supported and you can even pin a favorite site to the homescreen. Another handy option is to let Bing suggest sites as you type in the URL and Internet Explorer will also suggest sites from the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some things missing though ? Flash is one, but we were at least hoping for Silverlight, which didn?t work either. Saving files is problematic too ? you can only save files that the OS can handle. Text reflow is another feature we missed ? if you zoom in as much as possible to make fonts readable, you?ll have to pan left and right to read the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>YouTube is obviously not supported and the current YouTube app is just a bookmark and nothing more. There are alternative browsers in the Marketplace but they still use IE for rendering (so they don?t have Flash or Silverlight either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.3? WVGA screen of the HD7 and its siblings (HD2, EVO 4G, Desire HD) is currently the biggest screen on a device that can be called a phone. The advantage is two-fold: you can zoom out to fit the entire page without the text getting too small (so you can read comfortably) and interactions are easy ? no more hunting for that tiny link.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizing your day with WP7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar prefers two view modes ? agenda and day view. You have month view too, but you can?t access it by side-swiping ? you need to use the soft key for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two softkeys are Today (brings you to the current date) and Add an appointment. That?s the only type of event you get, but it has enough options to suit your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple calendars, including our Google Calendar but we had to add it as an Outlook (ActiveSync) account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set multiple alarms ? each with its own name, ringing sound and repeat pattern. We set up ten and yet the add alarm button didn?t grey out ? the HTC HD7 can handle more alarms than we know what to do with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a basic calculator too, which has big, easy to hit buttons ? turn the phone on its right side and the calculator adds hexadecimal digits and a few more operations (e.g. mod), turn it on its left and you get trigonometry and logarithms.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mobile office is better than ever, still not perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Office hub is an important part of the Windows Phone 7 package. The interface is identical to the other hubs and it?s the best mobile Office suite we?ve seen yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections ? OneNote, Documents and SharePoint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft?s collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you?re done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you?d need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let?s look at the two most important apps ? Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported. PowerPoint files live in the Documents section too ? but they are for viewing only, you can?t edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Word file support is very good. When reading a file, you can tap the Outline key to view a list of all titles from the document. The other way for navigating long files is the Find key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s undo and redo options but strangely, there?s no way to create lists, like in OneNote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the biggest missing feature is copy and paste. That?s a huge miss for a document editor ? you can?t copy and paste parts of other documents, emails, messages, sites, nothing. We?re guessing many people will sooner or later find this omission quite frustrating. Microsoft will be fixing that in early 2011.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel viewer/editor is pretty good too, but like the Word editor it misses some features. You can add formulas to cells (though it?s not as easy as on the desktop Excel and there are fewer cells available), you can sort and filter the cells too, even merge some of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But cell formatting is limited to date, money or percentages. You can?t even change the currency sign. Another must-have missing is row and column insertion. Several sheets are supported but you get three by default and you can?t rename or delete them, nor add new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft?s fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing search, voice commands and SkyDrive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like the Bing website, there are new photos every day to serve as a background, but WP7 has one extra ? three squares on the photo, which give you three interesting facts about what?s in the picture. The copyright sign in the bottom right also reveals the location of the photo (e.g. ?Waterfall on the Arroyo del Salto River?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not useful per se, but it?s a nice ?Did you know...?? type of feature for the curious-minded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like any other Windows Phone 7, HTC HD7 has extensive voice recognition capabilities ? you just press and hold the Windows key and say your command. You can do things like ?Call Sarah at work?, ?Open calendar? and even ?What can I say?? if you?re not sure what commands you can give.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SkyDrive is Microsoft?s cloud storage service and they offer 25GB of free storage (individual files must be 50MB max). You can integrate it with desktop Windows Explorer and it has some integration with Windows Phone 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right now, you can upload photos including auto uploading of all pictures you snap with the camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Hub and other HTC apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are several HTC apps preloaded on the HD7 and we?ve already covered some of them. Now it?s time to look at the ones we haven?t covered yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hub for a brief moment looks like Sense UI ? once that moment passes you see that the only thing borrowed from Sense is the clock with a weather forecast. A tap on the clock brings up a five day forecast. You can have multiple locations and the weather conditions are visualized in traditional Sense UI fashion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s those prolonged animations that may be the Hub?s undoing. Each time you start the app, each time you tap the clock there?s an (admittedly attractive) animation that?s several seconds long. The novelty of it will quickly wear out and there?s no option to disable it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, below the clock is a list of featured HTC apps ? the ?Get more? button will take you to the HTC Apps section of the Windows Phone Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Converter has an easy to use, touch-optimized interface and can handle conversions in many areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Connection Setup is a bit of an odd app ? it lets you pick country and carrier for the GSM connection. It?s odd because it pretty much doubles functionality Windows Phone 7 already has in the settings menu (the country selection is new though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final preloaded app we haven?t covered is Stocks. It does what its name suggests ? you can track the stock exchange by adding companies and keeping an eye on the charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Who needs a paper map when you have Bing Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD7 comes with a GPS receiver built-in, which got an accurate GPS lock a little over two minutes. Cell tower and Wi-Fi positioning is available too ? it gets a lock almost instantly but it?s accurate to only 100-150 meters (good enough for location based services).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The native mapping app is Bing Maps ? it has two modes (regular map mode and satellite photo mode) and you can get directions and information on nearby businesses too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, when you zoom in down to street level, Bing maps automatically switches to satellite imagery. However, the cool Bird?s eye view from the desktop Bing Maps isn?t available nor is Streetside view (Microsoft?s Street View alternative).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three softkeys available are for directions, my location and search. The extended menu has options to clear the map of any markers you?ve placed, toggling aerial view and accessing the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the map is easy and relatively fast. Zooming is done by pinching, and for a bit of eye candy when new tiles are loaded they fade in smoothly instead of just popping up. Overall the effect is looks much smoother than on Google Maps for Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold places the marker on a specific location ? tap the marker and you get About (a map screenshot and the address, which you can send over a message or email) and Nearby, which shows nearby POI with a rating and basic info (like a phone and a web site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get Directions from my location button, which will find step by step instructions to get you to your destination by either driving or walking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for what?s missing ? there?s no Navigate from here option, which can be quite useful. For example, you?re going to the theater, but want to check how far away the restaurant you?re going to afterwards is from the theater.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can still do that, but you can?t pick it from the map ? you have to use the search to find that location. Another thing ? you can?t add more than one destination when planning the route (Google Maps can?t do that either though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there was no trace of voice-guided navigation either, even though Windows Mobile 6.x can do it. It would have transformed the HD7 into a 4.3? SatNav unit (which can run up a few hundred dollars).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice-guided navigation is another thing that 2011 is expected to bring, though it hasn?t been confirmed officially.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Apps offers stuff for free<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace has gotten a few tweaks since we last saw it. It?s organized into four main sections ? applications, games, music and the HTC Apps. A fifth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update ? there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it?s on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, Top, New, Free and finally, Categories which has the games sorted into genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too ? new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (it?s 15 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections ? so, songs get mixed in with the apps and games. This is a little annoying since you don?t need song results while searching for an app and vice versa. But still, it?s not a major problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of apps is growing fast (it passed the 3000 mark recently) and some key apps are already available ? like the official Twitter app for example. The option to install a trial version for a game or app has been added and it?s very convenient ? how much you get to play depends on the individual developer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 30MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Apps section offers HTC-made, HTC-exclusive apps for free. There are handy things like Attentive Phone ? it offers pocket mode, quiet ring on pickup, flip to mute and flip for speaker (features we?ve seen on their Android phones). There are less useful apps like Flashlight and a ?she loves me, she loves me not? app but you?ll probably end up downloading everything from the HTC Apps section.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox Live and games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox ? from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests ? which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there?s a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live ? the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace offers a decent selection of games ? anything from popular puzzles like Bejeweled to Assassin?s Creed, Guitar Hero and so on. Games are usually in the 5-10 US dollars range but there are some free ones ? and you can also just go for a quick play with a trial version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Remote services from the WindowsPhone.Live.com cloud<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Microsoft has added extensive support for ?in the cloud? features in Windows Phone 7. The WindowsPhone.Live.com site is where you can access those features from your browser ? everything from remote wipe to browsing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Open the site in your browser and sign in with the Live ID that you use on your WP7 phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once that?s done you have access to the Find My Phone features. You can make the phone ring or see its last location on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it turns out that your phone is lost, you can lock it and leave a ?please return? note on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you fear it?s been stolen, you can remote wipe it too (which erases all data from the phone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Live also lets you browse and edit contacts, calendar events and OneNotes too (those are edited with Office Live).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also browse photos you?ve uploaded to SkyDrive. We already mentioned that the camera of every WP7 phone can be set to automatically upload all pics you snap there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of SkyDrive, using Windows Live Mesh you can sync your computer with your SkyDrive account too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having the biggest screen around is a matter of prestige and the HTC HD7 is a marvel ? the bezel around the screen is so thin it makes other phones look fat, despite their smaller screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ve already seen the same basic setup as the HD7 with two other OSes ? first the WinMo-powered HD2, then the Desire HD Android (and its CDMA cousin, the EVO 4G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the HTC HD7 comes with the newest OS on the market and it?s one of the flagships. There are so many things that just work better on a bigger screen (web browsing, viewing photos, even typing on a virtual keyboard), which is what the HD7 thrives on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are potential showstoppers however ? and, disappointingly, it?s the display itself. It obviously has some high response time, which results in ghosting when scrolling or watching videos. Now that certainly reduces the perceivable fluidity of most UI elements (and is a serious disadvantage when it comes to watching videos). The screen is also a little less saturated that we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is not perfect (especially that shutter key), the gallery with no slideshow is a missed opportunity, the singular loudspeaker on the back ? the HTC HD7 has its flaws.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you want Windows Phone 7 and a big screen the HD7 has a good lead on the competition. The QWERTY-fied Dell Venue Pro (4.1? WVGA) aside, the 4? Samsungs (Omnia 7, Focus) are the only ones that come close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 is the closest competitor ? it sports a 4? WVGA screen but it?s SuperAMOLED and offers a much better picture than the HD7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I8700 Omnia 7 ? HTC 7 Trophy ? LG E900 Optimus 7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC 7 Trophy and LG E900 Optimus 7 have screens that are a good half an inch smaller. Unlike the 7 Trophy and the euro version of the HD7, both the Omnia 7 and Optimus 7 are available with 16GB built-in memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3.8? is the screen size of the HTC 7 Surround as well and it?s got a kickstand just like the HD7. However, it adds slide-out surround speakers to the mix and it?s got 16GB internal memory too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC 7 Surround ? HTC Desire HD</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can ditch Windows Phone 7 all together and go with the HTC Desire HD ? pretty much the same hardware, besides the 8MP camera, the microSD slot (with 8GB card already in it), more RAM and of course Android 2.2 Froyo. You can even just buy the older HD2, install Android on it and thank the devs that made it possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a tough call between the HD7 and the Desire HD ? unless you insist on Windows Phone 7, the Desire HD is better (even if it?s a bit pricier). The HD7 has one of the poorest displays we?ve seen in a while (regardless of OS and manufacturer) but if that doesn?t bug you, you are welcome to give the HTC HD7 a serious consideration ? there are no compact WP7 phones, so you might as well get the biggest screen around.</paragraph>
