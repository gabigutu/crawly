		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This year, Lenovo had the honor of unveiling Motorola's newest flagship offerings. These flagship offerings are the Moto Z, which aims to succeed the Moto X, and the Moto Z Force, which is a bigger and badder version of the Moto Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force is aimed at succeeding last year's Droid Turbo 2 (exclusive to Verizon in the US, Moto X Force in worldwide markets). Both the Moto Z and Z Force are identical in height and width, and their thickness is the only way to tell the two apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other difference with the Moto Z Force is the significantly larger battery, the added girth that comes with a larger battery, a higher resolution 21MP camera, and the shatter proof screen that will survive drops of up to 5 feet onto flat surfaces. These specs make the Moto Z Force a worthy competitor to the recently reviewed Samsung Galaxy S7 active.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force will remain as a Verizon exclusive model in the US and for now. As of this review, there are currently no plans to release the Moto Z Force outside of the US. Making it like the Samsung Galaxy S7 active which remains as an AT&amp;T exclusive and is not available anywhere else in the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force is a worthy competitor to the Samsung Galaxy S7 active as they both play fine with water (Moto Z Force is splash resistant only), they both offer shatter-proof displays, and they both are touted as ultra-durable devices with large batteries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already reviewed the Moto Z, but the Moto Z Force is aimed at a slightly different consumer, but mostly the power user. Paired with the US' best (although, most expensive) carrier, the Moto Z Force Droid also carries a $96 premium over the Moto Z Droid when purchasing from Verizon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force takes on the Moto Z by offering a larger batter, higher resolution 21MP camera, and the aforementioned shatterproof display. We are curious to see if Lenovo has changed the recipe for creating their shatter-proof display. The previous iteration of this screen, which we saw in the Droid Turbo 2 and Moto X Force had diminished viewing angles, and the plastic-based display lens was more prone to light scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force works with the same Moto Mods as the Moto Z. Both it and the Moto Z Force have otherwise identical hardware on the exterior, except for the thickness. The Moto Z Force is 25% thicker than the razor thin 5.2mm Moto Z, but it's still quite thin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera performance with the Moto Z was decent, and we are expecting the 21MP camera found in the Moto Z Force to be even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us onto the next page to see what's inside the Moto Z Force's retail package.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force Droid Edition comes in a standard box. Quite similar to the Moto Z's packaging. Much like the phones themselves, the Moto Z Force's box is a bit thicker. Also, the Z Force's packaging says "Force" on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here we see Lenovo's logo on the front of the box. It's safe to say we'll be seeing it on all Moto devices from now on. Slide the box out of the packaging sleeve and you can lift the top half up, and we are greeted by the Moto Z Force.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the smartphone itself we find the SIM tray tool, the 30W Turbo Charger, the 3.5mm audio jack to USB-C adapter. There is also a rubber-esque "holder" for your wired headphones so that you can wrap your earbuds in to prevent them from getting tangled in a purse or pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that this phone does not come with any cable to PC connection to transfer files and data. The 30-watt (wow!) TurboCharger does not have a removable cable. The wall charger and the cable form a single unit. You'll need to find another cable or USB-C to microUSB adapter to connect to your computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone does come with a default "style shell" or back plate which is used to protect the back when you are otherwise not using any Moto Mod. Moto will sell more of these style shells in different colors for about $20 each for fabric or 'wooden' materials. Genuine leather style shells will be $25.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware and Design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force isn't as paper thin as the Moto Z, but the Moto Z Force's added weight (about 16% heavier than the Moto Z) and thickness (about 25% thicker) are justified thanks to its beefier 3,500mAh battery. Even though the phone is thicker and could have featured a 3.5mm headphone jack, there still isn't one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Style shell included with the Moto Z is designed out of a faux-wood exterior which mimics wood grain pretty well from afar. This color of Style Shell is called "Charcoal Ash" and comes bundled with the Lunar Grey model. We highly recommend using the included Style shell when not using any Moto Mod as it contributes to the ergonomics of the phone in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the phone feels "blocky" just where the frame meets the rear panel. The transition between the two is quite sharp, and the Style shell helps to round it out a bit. The Style shell also (virtually) eliminates the camera hump on the back, protecting both the camera ring and frame from frequent contact with possibly erosive surfaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gone is the dimple on the back which had many fans and was even rumored to be a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner at one point. The introduction of Moto Mods is perhaps the primary reason for putting the fingerprint scanner on the front as well as the reason for flattening out the ergonomically curved backside that has been around since the original (2013) Moto X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force's right side is home to three hardware keys. These are the only physical buttons since the phone uses on-screen navigation buttons. The placement of the buttons is quite new. They are pretty far up and may take some time getting used to. A nice touch is the grippy texture on the power button which lets you differentiate the keys by feel alone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These keys are quite satisfying. No complaints here with the travel, clickiness, or their sturdiness at all. They aren't too hard to press or too soft to accidentally fire off. The volume keys even have a nice bevel that goes around them - a great touch for attention to detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side (without the style shell) doesn't look like it has a lot going on, but there's actually more to it than meets the eye.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start from the top. There are two glass panels on the top and bottom ends of the phone which are there to let signals pass through for various antennas and connectivity features like NFC and Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear camera is here too, and it combines the dual-LED flash into the camera ring with the Verizon-Exclusive "Droid" branding just between the camera sensor and the flash. This is very nice as it's the only clue that this is a Verizon device (as the 'Droid' branding is exclusive to Verizon). There is otherwise no Verizon branding anywhere on the body of the phone itself, the Verizon logo appears in the boot animation along with the Droid branding, but there are no traces of red.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal back plate also features a pin-striped pattern, which we've never seen on other devices before and it gives our 'Lunar Gray' review unit a professional-looking and formal appearance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The metal backing is really hard to keep clean from fingerprints, though. We think Lenovo should have gone for a different colored Moto 'batwing' to let it stand out more. But Lenovo feels you'll be carrying it around with the included snap-on style shell which has a better contrasting batwing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lower backside of the phone has a bunch of pogo pins, connectors, and magnets which allow the handset to expand its functionalities by simply snapping on a Moto Mod magnetically. The Moto Mods we tried fit perfectly and the magnets are quite strong and keep them in place quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is empty, there are no buttons or trays. Moving onto the top and bottom edges of the phone, the top houses a noise-cancelling mic and the nanoSIM/microSD card tray while the bottom only has a single USB-C cable. Remember, there's no 3.5mm headphone jack anywhere, but there is an adapter included if you want to plug in your more expensive, noise-cancelling headphones during a long flight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we arrive to the front of the phone. It has the same motion sensors around the display like the Moto X had - wave your hand over the phone, and Moto Display will show you any missed notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the beautiful 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED screen, two microphones at the bottom (there is a total of four around the phone for improved listening of the Moto Voice commands).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the downside, the display glass seems like it's made of plastic. Upon closer inspection, you can see some of the waviness of the display lens' reflections. The Moto Z doesn't have this wavy look because its display isn't shatterproof so it's actual glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece over the screen doubles as the loudspeaker, and this is the only speaker on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then last, but not least, there's a 5MP selfie camera with a corresponding LED flash on the opposite side of the earpiece. Remember, there's no LED notification since the phone uses the entire screen to display your notifications via Moto Display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few shots of the Moto Z Force next to another 5.5-inch competitor, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, and the newly announced 5.7-inch Galaxy Note7. The Moto Z Force is larger than the Note7, despite having a smaller screen. Samsung really worked hard to shrink the Note7's footprint for a 5.7-inch display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force has a 5.5 inch quad-HD (2560x1440px) AMOLED display. This is a departure from the 2015 Moto X's LCD display in favor of an AMOLED panel. The AMOLED panel has the benefit of displaying darker blacks, more vivid colors, better outdoor legibility and it is also more power efficient in showing dark content. In many cases the screen is able to leave the black pixels powered off, such as when Moto Display is showing you notifications or the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our color rendition tests, the Moto Z Force has shown an average deltaE of 5.3 and max deltaE or 12.4. Colors are well represented and look pleasant to the eye with the default "Vivid" display setting. There is also a "Standard" setting, which displays more accurate colors, though not as accurate as we've seen other phones reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the "Standard" setting, colors are significantly more accurate with the exception of whites, which are cooler than they should be. The average deltaE is 2.2 now, but the Max deltaE is at 5.8. It seems the screens of the Moto Z and Z Force are quite comparable. We are happy to see that display quality didn't have to be sacrificed to become shatterproof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the non-glass display lens appears wavy upon close inspection under light. While both the Moto Z and Moto Z Force's touchscreen glasses feel identical, the Moto Z Force's display lens is made of a plastic-based material which can be more prone to light scratching than straight up glass. The trade-off is the peace of mind that you don't need to worry about the screen shattering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display panel features a brightness overdrive mode only available with 'Adaptive brightness' enabled which kicks the display all the way up to 517 nits. While this isn't the brightest screen we've seen, it's pretty good and you shouldn't have any trouble seeing the display in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is of such a great quality, there isn't even any color shifting at normal viewing angles. The colors don't start shifting until you're looking at the device from about 80 degrees from the center. With the exception of some of its color tuning, Moto Z Force sports an excellent screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force features a USB-C port which also doubles as the 3.5mm headphone jack (via an adapter) since there is no integrated headphone jack (because of this, there is no FM Radio chip either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other connectivity options include: Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac (5GHz), Bluetooth 4.1 LE, NFC, A-GPS, Wi-Fi Direct, and of course, the Moto Mod dock connector which allows for endless expansion of display signal, power, or addition of new sensors such as temperature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force will be compatible with CDMA (on Verizon): 850, 1900MHz, GSM/GRPS/EDGE (850, 900, 1800, 1900MHz), UTMS/HSPA+ (850, 900, 1700, 1900, 2100MHz), and LTE Bands: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13. This handset is to remain an exclusive device to Verizon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force also has Android Pay pre-loaded as the default mobile payment service. Android Pay works with NFC and works at all tap-to-pay terminals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the charging cable is a part of the charger as a single unit and cannot be separated. Likewise, the Moto Z Force does not come with any type of cable that you can connect to a computer to transfer files back and forth. You'll have to buy your own data transfer cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A larger 3,500 mAh battery makes an appearance with the Moto Z Force, a battery that's about 35% larger than the one found in the Moto Z, a 2,600mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were excited to check how much better the larger battery improves the phone's endurance. The great news is, if you are a battery hog, you can invest in the Moto Mod Power Pack and add even more endurance to your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Moto Z, The Z Force comes with a 30W TurboPower Charger (The Moto Z comes with a 15W version). This TurboPower charger takes the Moto Z Force from 0 to 62% in 30 minutes. That's quite impressive! The TurboPower 30 Charger is rated at 5V @ up to 5.7A which is technically 28.5W.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force scored 88h on our battery testing. Likewise the Moto Z scored 53h with a 2,600mAh battery. If you are deciding whether to pay a little extra ($100 premium) for the Moto Z Force over the Moto Z, let these numbers factor into your decision making process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force handeled itself quite well in our battery test. In fact, it scored 1h more than the Snapdragon variant of the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. Both have comparably similar battery sizes, AMOLED screens with the same size, and are powered by the same Snapdragon 820 CPU. The Moto Z Force has the upper hand even though the S7 edge has a battery 100mAh larger, and various motion and light sensors for Moto Enhancements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those who'd like to invest in a Moto Mod battery pack, we ran a couple of tests with the 2,300mAh Tumi Power Pack. It added a total of 41% to the Moto Z Force and took about an hour and 30 minutes to completely discharge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a breakdown of how the Power Pack charged the Moto Z Force over the span of a charge cycle:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you are on the fence about getting a Moto Mod Power Pack, take into account that you already have a wall charger that will charge the Moto Z Droid at break-neck rate. Of course, that means you'll need to have easy access to a wall outlet when you are on the go.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force is not unlike the Moto X devices in the past. They run near-vanilla Android while adding Moto's value-added features like Moto Voice (touchless commands), Moto Actions, and Moto Display. We'll cover these Moto Actions at the bottom of the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface features many elements from the Original Moto X. Even though the Moto Z Force finds itself in a brand new body, Lenovo didn't think it should change up the software that Moto was known for. Even since the original Moto X, the Moto Z Force takes after the well-optimized software experience and intuitive features of the Moto X models before it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None of the Moto X devices have ever included a fingerprint scanner, even though the original intention of the dimple was to make it one. The Moto Z Force introduces the fingerprint scanner to these device models, and it can be found on the chin on the phone. We are not great fans of its square shape, but we appreciate fingerprint scanners positioned on the front more than we do with the ones on the back. Of course, a rear-mounted scanner must have been out of the question because it would be in the way of the Moto Mod interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Remember when we mentioned the power and volume keys felt a bit too high? Well, Lenovo implemented a new feature so that you don't have to reach up to put the phone to sleep, so this helps to soften the initial unfamiliar feeling. Touching your finger to the fingerprint sensor while the screen is off will wake the phone and bypass the lock screen. Likewise, if you hold a finger (any finger) for about half a second on the fingerprint scanner when the phone is awake, it will put the phone to sleep. So you could virtually never need to press the power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the lock screen looks much like it does on a Nexus device. Swiping up will either unlock the phone or ask you for your pattern, pin, or password. A swipe from the right to the left will open the camera and a swipe from the left will prompt for Google-voice command.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The launcher is much like Google Now launcher (which you can alternatively install) but is quite minimal and doesn't offer too many options nor themes. If you find yourself bored of the launcher or wish to use icon packs and themes, you may install another launcher that fits your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer scrolls vertically, and there is a search bar at the top to help you find that one game you haven't played in a while amongst your vast collection of apps. There are no folders found in the app drawer (this seems to be becoming the standard with major flagships whose UIs are heavily skinned like TouchWiz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One pull-down of the notification bar will show you any pending notifications and a "CLEAR" button to dismiss them all. One more swipe down from the notification bar will peel lower the notifications further and show you the quick toggles for various connectivity options as well as a brightness slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a shortcut to the Settings App in the upper right corner. The only setting that is exclusive to the Moto Z lineup is the "Moto Mods" option which lets you change the options for whatever Moto Mod is attached to the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Moto Enhancements<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The name of these value-added features that the Moto Z Force can perform have been renamed since the release of the first Moto X in 2013. Active Display, and Touchless Controls from that era have since been rebranded as "Moto Enhancements" which can be all seen in the "Moto" app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This Moto app shows us all the options available for the Moto Z Force including [Moto] Display, Actions, and Voice. These settings offer a few convenient actions, gestures, or voice commands to help you operate your phone quicker and more intuitively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best Moto features that other companies still haven't been able to compete with is Moto Display. It's a status notification screen that will light up showing only the time and any missed notifications even when the screen is off. These notifications can then be pressed to preview the notification, swipe up to unlock and view the notification, or swipe down to dismiss it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison, Nexus phones have their 'Ambient display', which us a similar concept but it doesn't work as consistently, and we find that it is more susceptible to activating in a pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto Voice allows you to set up a custom voice command so your phone can wake up without needing to touch it. The app guides you through the process. It intelligently makes a beeping noise and listens back for it to ensure that the room you are has the correct acoustics needed to record your wake-up phrase. We find that making a pillow fort in a quiet room works best, as even the quietest rooms won't be deemed acceptable by the app if the echo is too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto Assist is no longer a part of the Moto Enhancements app. Rather, the individual features under Moto Assist section have been shuffled around into other parts of the Moto app. One of these features included one that detected when the phone's owner was driving and offered to read all notifications aloud as to keep on-road distractions to a minimum. This feature can be found in the Moto Voice menu, under 'Talk to me.'</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the option to silence the Moto Z Force during meetings has been moved to the "Flip for Do Not Disturb" menu, under 'Automatic Rules'. Yeah, they're buried pretty deep in there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a total of 7 Moto Actions, though only 6 of them require you to perform an action. The classic Moto X actions are still here like waving over the display to peek at time and notifications, chop twice for flashlight, and twist twice to launch the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other general actions as well (below) like: Attentive Display (keeps your screen on as you are looking at it), Flip for Do Not Disturb (turn the phone on its face to enter Do Not Disturb Mode and change settings for automatically entering DnD mode), Pick up to stop ringing (self-explanatory), and Swipe to shrink screen (shrinks the screen to make it easier to reach with one hand).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Moto Mods<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force launches alongside a new line of expandable accessories which offer a new type of expandability to the Moto Z lineup. These examples include things like expandable battery packs, a loud speaker for music, and even display mirroring (cue the Moto Mod Insta-Share projector).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When Moto Mods are "docked", the phone vibrates and makes a sound to confirm a successful coupling. If you are using the Moto Mod for the first time, you'll be greeted with the corresponding welcome screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The docking is quite straightforward as the Moto Mod is attached via quite strong magnets to the phone so placing it wrong is out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping down to the quick toggles is also a great way to check the battery status of your Moto Mod. All the Moto Mods we tested had their own built-in batteries. The JBL SoundBoost Speaker and Moto Insta-Share Projector both have their own integrated batteries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto widget in the home screen will also display your Moto Mod's battery status. One more thing, if you have a Moto Mod docked on the Moto Z Force and you plug the phone to charge, the Moto Mod itself will not be charged until your phone's integrated battery reaches 75%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conveniently, both the JBL speaker and Insta-Share Projector have their own USB-C connector ports so you can charge them independently from the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tumi battery pack, strangely, does not have its own USB-C slot. So the only way to charge it is by docking it to the phone before putting your Moto Z Force to charge at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the Moto Mods about to be mentioned have their own battery indicators. A button on the flat-side of the Mod can be pressed to show an LED which will represent an estimated reading of the power remaining.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tumi - 2200mAh battery Moto Mod<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One Moto Mod that will likely be popular among Moto Z Force owners is a battery pack that you can (quite, literally) piggy-back onto your phone and transfer juice to your smartphone when it is running low. The one we got to play with is a Tumi battery add-on which contains a 2,200mAh battery. This add-on will revive the Moto Z Force up to 60% from 0%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Kate Spade branded battery pack which brings wireless charging connectivity to the Moto Z Force's charging routine. The Tumi battery pack is also available in a wireless-enabled version. Perhaps the battery pack itself can be charged independently without relying on the phone's dock to start charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The non-wireless charging version of either battery shells will set you back $60 while the wireless-enabled versions will burn a $90 hole in your wallet. You'll likely find deals for the Moto Z Force which might toss in a free Moto Mod like a battery pack or JBL speaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>JBL SoundBoost Speaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>JBL has developed a speaker for use with the Moto Z Force's Moto Mod dock. There is no setup or pairing required. All you need to do is slap the speaker onto the back of the Moto Z Force and start playing your music or video clip. There is also a kickstand if you don't wish to put your phone face-down on a flat surface (as this commonly causes small bits of dirt to scratch the glass).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The speaker Mod contains its own battery which JBL says will last for up to 10 hours of music playback before the Moto Z Force's battery kicks in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the battery pack mentioned above, the SoundBoost speaker has its own USB-C port for easy charging.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Moto Insta-Share Projector<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Insta-Share Projector is one of the best Moto Mods available. It's a mini Projector that can be viewed up to 70-inches (diagonally). This Moto Mod mirrors whatever can be viewed on the phone's display and anything goes - from a photo album to a YouTube video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rather than huddle around the phone's screen, you can use this projector to throw your phone's display onto a wall. We ran the projector for several YouTube videos and only found the phone to become moderately warm thanks to that fan that gives the projector ample air flow to prevent overheating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This projector will set you back $300. Pretty steep for an accessory which only works with the Moto Z Force and that outputs a 480p (854 x 480px to be exact) resolution image. It's also worth mentioning the battery found in the projector is 1,100mAh and will run for 1 hour before depleting the phone's battery, but you can plug the projector to power independently from the Moto Z Force.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for audio with the projector, you're pretty much limited to three options: USB-C out (via the 3.5mm adapter), internal speaker, or an external Bluetooth speaker. Unfortunately, it's not possible to simultaneously use both the JBL SoundBoost speaker and the Insta-Share Projector.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic Benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force features Motorola's 'Mobile Computing System' which joins a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 CPU and Adreno 530 Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 (dual-core 2.15 GHz Kyro &amp; dual-core 1.6 GHz Kyro) with a Natural Language Processor and Contextual Computing Processor. There is also a healthy 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Likewise, the Snapdragon 820 is quite the improvement over the CPU found in the Moto Z's predecessor: the Moto X Pure Edition (A.K.A. Moto X Style), which sported a 6-core Snapdragon 808 CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 820 is found in several flagship phones this year like the LG G5, Samsung Galaxy S7 Active, and HTC 10. All of these phones will perform similarly with some phones perhaps outperforming others with different speeds of RAM or internal storage speeds for reading and writing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also tossed in a couple of phones that use alternative-CPUs like the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge (Exynos 8890) and iPhone 6S Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with single-core power test, the iPhone remains at the top in these tests. It's no wonder the iPhone 6S only has a dual-core CPU, that's likely all it needs to power through its super-optimized software. Behind the iPhone are three Snapdragon 820 CPU powered phones. The Moto Z Force was in line with the other Snapdragon 820 devices of the bunch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to multi-core power, the Exynos-powered Galaxy S7 remained at the top. The other Snapdragon 820 devices all performed within reasonable margins of each other. The iPhone 6S Plus sits at the very end of the ranking here, unlike the single core benchmarks above.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark II 2.0 adds RAM and storage tests on top of CPU ones to give a better indication of overall performance. The Moto Z Force posts excellent numbers, comfortably ahead of the other Snapdragon 820 contenders.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force is well ahead of other Snapdragon 820 competitors when it comes to Antutu 6. However, the HTC 10 is well ahead of the Moto Z Force itself.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Next up with graphics, the Moto Z carries the Adreno 530 for hardware-intensive rendering, as do the other Snapdragon 820 phones of the bunch. The offscreen test ensures an even playing field for devices that might differ in screen resolution. The Moto Z Force performed right at or above the other Snapdragon 820 devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other Snapdragon contenders did just as well with a marginal difference. The Exynos-powered S7 edge is right behind the Snapdragon 820 pack. Qualcomm's CPU setup shines here in the gaming and graphic-intensive department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that onscreen tests will yield different results. The Xperia X Performance, OnePlus 3, and iPhone 6S Plus all have significantly fewer pixels that need to be pushed around. These devices, in turn, will perform better than the QHD offerings.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force runs a bit warm when performing high-activity tasks like playing a hardware intensive game or updating a bunch of apps at once. But it gets the hottest when playing a GPS-intensive game that also uses the camera like Pokemon Go. The Snapdragon 820 is a great and crazy fast CPU, don't get us wrong. We love the performance on the Moto Z Forceand it performed exceptionally well and we saw no visible lag anywhere even in high-performance games like RipTide2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>SMS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force Droid that we are reviewing is a Verizon device. Naturally, there are Verizon apps that the carrier might like us to use rather than a default app. More specifically, this is the SMS app developed for Verizon customers. Although the app is rich with features, bells and whistles, the SMS app in question is far too complicated for the average Joe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This SMS app in question is called Message+, and it offers customers an SMS platform that is cloud-enabled through Verizon's own servers which allow you to send and receive SMS and MMS messages remotely via a desktop or over Wi-Fi. Texting over Wi-Fi isn't a novelty nowadays with more carriers supporting Wi-Fi calling. But, the Message+ app does have the ability to allow Verizon customers to sync and restore their SMS inbox as well as send and receive SMS through Verizon's web portal. Pretty cool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, Google's Messenger app for SMS/MMS is pre-installed in the Moto Z Force. If customers don't care for the Message+ app, at least Messenger could work out of the box. But most people won't see it because there's already a shortcut on the Home screen dock for Message+.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer looks much like the vanilla-Android's stock dialer. Along the top of the dialer are four menus that you can scroll through - Dialer, Speed Dial (favorites), Recents, and Contacts. You can tap the mic at the corner of the screen and say the name of the contact you'd like to call, this will even work if the phone is not connected to a data network, in cases where you run out of data, so you've had to disable the data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Options in the dialer include import/export (as the dialer is also partially made up of the phone app), which accounts to show contacts from, and more phone settings include various voicemail settings, and video calling function (only usable between Verizon devices).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pre-installed Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Moto Z Force is a Verizon unit. So we can expect to see a significant amount of bloatware pre-installed on the unit. Here's a breakdown of the bloatware found on the Moto Z Force.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Verizon Apps:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Non-Google Apps:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike our Moto Z unit, the Moto Z Force did not auto-install more bloatware apps after setup.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force relies on stock Google apps for viewing photos, video playback, and the music player. The Gallery in question is part of Google's Photos service. If you are familiar with Google Photos, then you'll be quite familiar with the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock offering also offers many basic editing features to help you crop, rotate, and adjust basic levels. There's also an "auto enhance" feature which automatically adjusts the photo the way Google's software thinks it should look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video playback is just as simple as the photo viewer. There is also an "edit" button but it only allows you to crop the video's length. Unfortunately, the stock video player doesn't come close to 3rd party video players that you can find on the Play Store with features like additional format and subtitle support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force uses Google Play music as the stock music player which offers a free music streaming service (think YouTube, but for music and ad-supported). These days, it's more common to either subscribe to a music service or stream music from a free service. The days of loading 20GB of music to a microSD card are slowly being left behind in the past.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When using Google Music, you'll be shown a YouTube icon which will take you to that song's music video on YouTube (if it has one). Besides the "Now Playing" screen, album art can be seen in the notification shade (along with music controls) and the lock screen also features the album art in a full-screen version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly, the Motorola Moto Z Force Droid matched the audio output of the regular Moto Z almost perfectly. That?s good news too, since it means that the flagship delivers perfectly accurate audio with an active external amplifier and matches them with nicely high volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Headphones don?t cause much damage either - nothing besides a well contained hike in stereo crosstalk. Another great performance by the Moto family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now here go the results so you can do your comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Droid Turbo 2 (Moto X Force) featured a similar loudspeaker setup as the Moto Z Force does now. There is a single loudspeaker on the front of the phone which also doubles as the earpiece during phone calls. The speaker on the Moto Z Force Droid turned out louder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker is strong enough to casually watch a video or listen to music. But could potentially struggle to be heard in a crowded restaurant. Although, Motorola made sure the speaker was loud and clear enough for sounds with more upper-mids and treble sounds (which are qualities that most ringtones have). The speaker makes just the right amount of compromise while still making sure that you won't miss any important calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Moto Z scored just a few dB higher in the ringtone test, the difference between the two loudspeakers is negligible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A little slow, but lots of detail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force's camera is right in line with that of the Droid Turbo 2 in specs. The 21MP camera sensor in the Moto Z Force features a f/1.8 aperture, phase detection autofocus, laser-assisted focus for close range subjects, and 1.12-micron pixel size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z Force comes with an increase in the aperture size from f/2.0 to f/1.8 compared to the Droid Turbo 2 (Moto X Force). However, the Moto Z Force took a half step back in pixel size. The Turbo 2 had pixels 1.4 microns in size, while the Z Force has 1.12 micron pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resulting photos are exceptionally good in all lighting conditions. With the exception of longer than normal shutter times in poor light and the occasionally clunky interface, the Moto Z Force left us satisfied with in the camera department.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Remember how minimal and simple and the Moto X's camera UI was? Well that's all changed for the most part. The camera UI has been revamped from the ground up. Lenovo took the style and feel of the Moto X's original camera UI and made a new UI based off of that. The result is a little disorienting, but not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many features in the camera including the native ability to scan barcodes and QR codes without needing to download 3rd party apps from the Play Store. There's also a Professional Mode which gives the user control over camera settings like shutter speed, manual focus, and ISO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you first start the camera, you'll have the option to choose whether you'd like to "tap anywhere" to take a photo use a dedicated on-screen shutter button. It's worth noting the volume button can be used as a shutter key as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR, flash, and timer shortcuts can be found at the top (when in portrait) or left (when in landscape) and the shortcuts expand to show you more choices for that option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP front-facing camera adds one extra control to this menu and that is for beauty mode. There are three options: auto, manual, or off. The manual option lets you move a slider like most other smartphones that offer a beauty mode which blends the skin tones to hide imperfections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To switch to another mode, you'll need to tap on the camera button next to the shutter button and choose the option. There is no longer a convenient shortcut to start recording video right away. You'll need to tap on this button and switch to the video mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Professional mode looks like many others we've seen before. You're given all the controls in an overlay over the viewfinder. There's also a small arrow under all the controls which conveniently expands them all at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the Moto Z Force to occasionally hiccup when it comes to taking photos. Sometimes the camera cannot focus on the subject automatically unless you manually tell it where to focus by tapping on the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the resulting camera samples yielded excellent detail and color reproduction. The only downside to this camera is it requires a steady hand when it comes to photography in low light. What we mean is that, in order to keep the ISO down, the camera would intentionally lower the shutter speeds way below our comfortable handheld level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some comparison shots taken with the Moto Z Droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'll notice the top row of sample photos is in 16:9 aspect ratio. This is because the Moto Z Force defaults the camera to a cropped sensor mode, reducing the total resolution output from 21MP (4:3) down to 16.1MP (16:9).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the Moto Z Force delivered great photos with plenty of details and well represented color. Skies are the right shade of blue and we see minimal noise throughout these photos. When taking photos in favorable lighting conditions, the camera feels snappy with shutter button speeds kept to a minimum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OIS built into the camera system does a wonderful job of eliminating camera blur in well-lit scenarios. A day trip with the Moto Z Force will yield bright and colorful photos with plenty of detail to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While HDR images aren't meant to represent scenes with accurate colors, they are useful for bringing up detail from the shadows and reducing areas of overexposures in challenging scenes with strong light contrast. The Moto Z Force yielded very decent HDR performance. Colors are a bit too saturated for our taste, but the resulting photo will likely get many likes and comments on social media.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once lighting starts to settle down, the camera's speed between shots takes a noticeable hit. A nice feature is the overlay message that pops up when taking a photo in low light, telling us to "Hold camera steady" indicating that the camera needs a little more time to take the photo than usual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shots taken at night look excellent and the camera can capture more detail than you'd think. The last scene against the row of buildings was quite dark and we were surprised to see how well the shot came out. The only downside is you won't be able to catch great shots at night of moving cars or people. Your subject needs to be still, and you'll need a steady hand!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force had trouble focusing on the second low-light shot of the train station. The camera did not know where to focus on and kept focus hunting back and forth. Once we tapped where we wanted to focus, the hunting stopped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a panorama photo works just as in many other devices: tap the shutter key and take a continuous pan of the scene in front of you. Strangely, the panorama mode didn't let us take a photo wider than about 100 degrees and the resolution is greatly reduced. The amount of time it takes for a panorama to process is about 10 seconds during which also takes place in the foreground. You can't take more pictures during this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resulting images show poor level of details and do not blend scenes with drastically different exposures well. We would recommend that you find a third-party panorama-taking app in the Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5MP Selfie camera with LED flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force carried on the front facing LED flash from last year's Moto X. The result is a selfie camera that performs rather well. This 5MP front facing camera, though not that high of a resolution, compliments the rear 21MP camera rather well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In regular lighting, the camera shows plenty of detail and skin tones are on point. HDR brings an extra level of exposure and coloration, but its behavior is not that predictable. Colors are a little oversaturated when using HDR (just like the rear camera).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selfies taken in low light look great in line with the other flagship offerings this year. The front facing LED flash is a great way to add some fill light. Though, depending on your environment and how dark it is, using the front facing flash as a light source might get you a dark exposure of your surroundings, which is expected with such a small light source, but hardly ideal from a user's perspective.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Appropriately, the Moto Z is capable of recording video in 1080p @ up to 60fps and 4K @ 30 fps. However, the mode that produces the smoothest looking video is 1080p @ 30fps since it's both optically and digitally stabilized. Videos recorded in 60fps or 4K will be more shaky if you don't intend to use a tripod.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>60fps videos have the same bitrate as videos taken with 30fps. Having in mind that these videos have twice as many frames, you can already guess that each of those frames will have a reduced quality to fit within the size limit. As a result, the 60fps videos come with a rather degraded quality. The standard 30fps video looks much better and sharper than the 60fps clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some reason, both the Moto Z and Moto Z Force had an issue where the standard 1080p mode was recording strange-looking videos, as if we had activated the HDR mode. This only happened in 1080p video @ 30fps. You'll notice the video samples for the aforementioned video setting look strange compared to the other two. The glitch appeared to be fixed when we toggled HDR on, and then off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio recording is set to a standard 128kbps with stereo channels and a 48kHz sample rate. Video rates for 4K resolution are at about 50Mbps while 1080p videos are captured at about 17Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, we've got some samples for you to watch from YouTube below, or you can download them with the following links: 1080p @ 30fps HDR (~30MB) / 1080p @ 60fps (~30MB)/ 2160p (4K) @ 30fps (~90MB) taken straight from the Moto Z Force.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Moto Z Force Droid key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force is not as ergonomic as the Droid Turbo 2 (Moto X Force) was. Style shells make it easy to change up your look. Overall design is sturdy, yet minimalistic and 'to the point'.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AMOLED screen is a nice touch, and there is no degradation of picture quality as a result of shatter proofing. Visibility in sunlight is good, but the screen's coating makes it a teeny bit more prone to hairline scratches</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto Enhancements are excellent value-added features which barely impact battery life on standby. Moto Display and Moto Voice are a couple of our favorite features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery scores were excellent with an overall endurance rating of 88h. Moto's 30W TurboPower adapter charges the Moto Z Force's massive battery at breakneck rates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the exception of some Verizon bloatware, the Moto Z's near-stock Android experience is well appreciated by many. Moto Enhancements add great value to the UI experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 820 CPU is a firm choice. Likewise, 4GB of RAM is a healthy amount, so performance is bullet-proof. However, the phone does get quite warm under pressure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moto Mods are a great implementation of modular smartphone accessories. Although costly, the plus side is your Moto Mod investments are future-proof as they will work with the Moto Z's successor(s) next year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 21MP camera's performance is excellent in all lighting conditions, including low-light scenarios, as long as you have a steady hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing 5MP selfie camera performs quite well, even better than we anticipated. The front-facing LED flash illuminates the subject well in these low-light scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>4K videos look great, details and colors are well represented. 1080p videos @ 30fps glitched on us in two occasions, forcing some sort of a HDR effect but then everything went to normal. 1080p videos filmed at 60fps are significantly degraded in quality when compared to 30fps videos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo's Moto Z Force Droid took over for the Moto X Force (Droid Turbo 2 in the US) and has kept the same screen size as the standard Moto Z model. Whatever deal Verizon has struck with Motorola, obviously it's not one that they will be letting go of anytime soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many might be upset that the Moto Z Force is not making a worldwide debut (at least for now). Even in previous years of Verizon's Droid exclusivity, there was always a worldwide version (e.g. Droid Turbo 2 = Moto X Force). So this is why we still hang on to the chance of it happening again. Or perhaps Lenovo is doing away with a shatterproof version of the Moto flagship for worldwide release, we'll see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way we see it, the Moto Z Force should have been Moto's global flagship. Well, we guess the Moto Z will be easier to market as the world's thinnest smartphone. And it's not the first time Motorola has one of those - it was back in 2006 when they launched the world's thinnest smartphone of the time, the Moto Q.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Moto Z Force is only available in the US, we're going to compare it to models available for the US market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most obvious choice to have to consider is the Moto Z Droid. Otherwise the exact same phone, the Moto Z Force has a larger battery, thicker profile, and higher resolution 21MP camera. The $100 premium over the Moto Z is easily justified with the much larger battery. Of course this does come at the expense of having a thicker and heavier phone. Motorola has given us this choice that we have been longing for a long time so you can now have your cake and eat it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because the Moto Z Force is shatter proof, we have to compare it to the Samsung Galaxy S7 active. The S7 active serves a very niche market: the power user who's rugged and (or) outdoorsy lifestyle doesn't mix well with delicate slabs of glass. The Moto Z can also fill areas of the same niche, although drop test videos have proved the S7 active to take a heavier beating than the Z Force.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 active has a few similarities with the Z Force: both are exclusive to a US carrier, both are shatterproof, and both are (at least) splash resistant. But the Galaxy S7 active hits more points better than the Moto Z Force: larger battery, MIL-spec ruggedness, IP68 water immersion protection (the Z Force is only splash resistant), and superior camera. Of course, you have to sign a service deal with AT&amp;T to get that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next alternative is another 5.5-inch device, although, it's not a quad-HD display. The OnePlus 3 is a worthy competitor on the bang-for-buck sector, packing the same Snapdragon 820, a healthy 6GB of RAM, a great all-around camera, and a much lower cost at $399. The caveats are: no modularity (duh!), lower battery endurance, and the OnePlus 3 is not supported on Verizon if this is your carrier of choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G5 is a great alternative as both smartphones have a Snapdragon 820 that make them tick. But the other reason is that the G5 also incorporates modular accessories as (an option) part of the product experience, and even though the modular concept is great, the execution could have been better. The Moto Z Force's software shines brighter than the G5's as a more consistent and familiar experience. Not to mention the benefit of a much better battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 edge packs a beautiful, 5.5-inch, QuadHD, AMOLED screen into a more compact footprint. The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge matches the battery endurance, the performance, and the camera, and adds Samsung's suite of bells, whistles, and apps on top of that. TouchWiz might be a sore spot for some, but the Snapdragon 820 (or Exynos 8890) ensures an otherwise heavily skinned UI will run smoothly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 6S Plus is another 5.5-inch device with a great camera, solid battery life, and predictable software experience. If you do find yourself switching from an iPhone into Android territory, the Moto Force could be the right fit for you, accentuated with Moto Enhancements. If you decide to go with an iPhone instead, we recommend you wait a month or so more and get the new model at the current price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Force is a phone for Android power-users who would rather experience Android as it was meant to be, Nexus style, but with a few extra features on top. Although you wouldn't get the quickest updates as you would on Nexus devices, the Moto Z Force offers much more than the pure Android experience as long as you are willing to make the tradeoff.</paragraph>
