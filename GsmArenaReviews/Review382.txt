			<paragraph>Being part of the revamped XpressMusic line, the Nokia 5300 is expressive more than ever and is one great example of how you can have fun with your mobile phone. The dedicated music keys make a sure statement about the music-orientation of the handset. And if that is not enough you can always count on the 1.3 megapixel camera to capture your precious moments and view them on the TFT display with QVGA resolution. Connectivity is at its highest here, since the new Finnish music slider is armed with a mini-USB jack, a standard 3.5mm audio jack and even with stereo Bluetooth support. If the price is right, it really sounds like a good bargain, right? Well, you are not far from the truth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia has been working hard on developing and promoting their XpressMusic line of mobile phones in a determined way to fight back the Sony Ericsson's Walkman reign in this market niche. The two new handsets called Nokia 5300 XpressMusic, Nokia 5200 XpressMusic and the updated Nokia 3250 XpressMusic now constitute a serious attempt to establish the Finnish manufacturer mobiles on the music phones market. We won't comment on the Nokia 3250 for now since the two other mobiles are of much more interest to us, being brand new models. The Nokia 5200 and 5300 have pretty much the same design. The 5200 is more of a Lite version and is targeted at the budget-conscious buyers, while the Nokia 5300 is a representative of the midrange mobile phones in terms of price and equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up for now, the Walkman mobiles are still the leading music solution so don't expect these XpressMusic devices to overthrow the king of this realm. It seems though that Nokia has been putting some very serious efforts in campaigning their new handsets and as rumors go, the Finnish engineers have a few more devices up their sleeve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5300 XpressMusic is an exciting new phone for several reasons. Firstly, it is the first XpressMusic device to come up under the non-smartphone S40 user interface of the Finnish brand. Secondly, the slider form factor leaves it with no direct competitors in the Walkman camp in the respective price range. And finally, it offers features such as stereo Bluetooth support and 3.5 mm audio jack adapter. In fact, there is not even one Walkman mobile to have a standard mini-USB port. That practically makes the Nokia 5300 a leading offering in the midrange music class and it's up to us to see how it copes with the challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5300 is offered only in matt white color with a choice of two trimmings - red and dark grey. The trimmings in fact include only the central frame surrounding the display which incorporates the dedicated side multimedia keys. The handset we got to review was the one in white/grey color combination. The design of 5300 is sporty and somewhat reminds us of the Sony Ericsson W710. There is no doubt that it is aimed at the young audience and most probably it won't appeal to any other group of consumers. Nokia marketing campaign makes every effort to underline the fact that this line of devices is targeted at young people having fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Nokia 5300 should include a Nokia stereo headset HS-47, a standard 3.5 mm audio jack adapter and a microSD card with a size that would vary according to the region. The one we had in our office had a card with a capacity of 256MB. There is no USB data cable in the package, but since it is a standard 5-pin mini-USB one, the odds are that you may already have gotten one with your digital camera or MP3 player. And you can always buy one for cheap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A soap bar in shape and size<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5300 doesn't exactly rely on its slimness to attract attention. It measures 92.4 x 48.2 x 20.7 mm, which in fact makes it rather thick. But it's rather its body design than actually the thickness itself that's to blame, since it's even a few millimeters shorter and slimmer than Sony Ericsson W850. The weight of 106 g is also acceptable and it is by no means a heavy phone or anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of construction, well? construction has not always been the brightest side of a slider. In this case the mobile body is perfectly stable and rock solid when opened, but when closed it did seem to play a little - but not that much to turn you down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the phone is the one that might attract the most attention. In the upper part, above the display, there are two small holes, which in fact are the in-call speaker apertures. In the lower part there are four control keys and the navigation D-pad. The upper set of keys act as context keys for interacting with the phone's interface while the lower set are the call keys for accepting and ending calls. Just beside the red one there is a small hole which is in fact the microphone aperture. Opening the handset reveals the alphanumeric keypad, which is made out of the same material as the body. It is rather comfortable to work with, but more on navigation and keypad is to come later on in the review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 5300 closed and opened ? Right and left side</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 5300 in red</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the display, you can see the designations of the dedicated music keys. Those keys in fact are positioned on the phone's side and are covered with rubber while in the same time they are marked with small buds. The grey frame around the display is made out of plastic and only the keys themselves are covered with rubber. On the lower portion of the phone's body, you can see the 2.5 mm audio jack (you need the supplied adapter to go to 3.5 mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Left side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset incorporates the two volume keys and the camera shutter key. Those keys are also covered with rubber. Besides controlling the volume levels, the volume keys have some other predefined functions. A longer press on the Minus key activates the voice dialing, while a longer press on the Plus key lists the Push-to-talk contacts. It's worth mentioning that you can also activate the voice dialing by a longer press on the green soft key on the front panel - it's up to your choice. The Plus key's secondary function works also when you are browsing the menu, while the Minus key and the Camera release key don't - you have to be in standby mode to use those. Next to the camera release button you can find the Infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Right side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom side of the device is pretty bare since all system connectors are placed in top of the phone. Having a look there reveals the 5-pin miniUSB port, the charging port and the On/Off button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Bottom and top end</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back part of the Nokia 5300 you can see the 1.3 megapixel camera lens which has no cover at all, the self-portrait mirror and of course the aperture of the loudspeaker. The Nokia 5300 XpressMusic is visible on a metal plate on the back of the sliding part of the body. One cannot but think of Sony Ericsson W850 when they see that metal plate up there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 5300 back panel</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Behind the back panel cover, you can see the standard Li-Ion Nokia BL-5B battery with a capacity of 860 mAh. According to the manufacturer, the battery should last up to 223 hours of standby mode and up to 3.2 hours of talk time. Furthermore, it should provide up to 12 hours of play time. The actual play time is around 9 hours which is far worse than the Sony Ericsson Walkman player which have a dedicated music playing uptime of more than 20 hours. In our case when using the Nokia 5300 for around 15 minutes of calls a day and occasionally listening to music for another 15 minutes a day, the battery lasted about full 4 days, which is more than Sony Ericsson W850 when used in similar conditions. And those are the results which include some heavy testing on our side, so the achieved battery life is impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card slot is located under the back panel cover too just beside the hologram Nokia sticker on the battery. The slot is truly hot swappable as it proved in our tests. The SIM card bed is located besides the camera lens and the card itself gets locked by a special latch, which makes putting it in or taking it out very easy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Smooth sliding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were very pleased with the sliding mechanism of the Nokia 5300 since it offered smooth action and had a rather nice assisting spring, which would open and respectively close the device with almost no effort at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 5300 held in hand</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad of the 5300 proved extremely comfortable to work with and SMS-fans would be more than pleased with it. But our impression is that the comfortable keypad is something usual for recent mobiles in the slider form factor. Yet we greatly appreciated the positive feedback of the large keys, which are especially comfortable for people with large fingers. The same holds true for the navigation D-pad as well which is far better than most of the Sony Ericsson solutions. It reacts to the finger press instantly and sinks in the pressed direction smoothly with almost no resistance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 5300 keypad and navigation</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad has an even blue backlighting and makes a very nice impression. We can say only good words for the display too. There is absolutely no legibility problem with it even under direct sunlight. That is something common for all Nokia mobiles and we must say that as regards displays, they certainly lead the way. Otherwise, the display offers nice level of brightness and the colors are crisp and eye pleasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Display and keypad in the dark</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Making calls?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5300 offers great sound quality and exceptional voice clarity during calls and we had no problems with the network signal either. But that is standard nowadays and we wouldn't expect any less. The loudspeaker has nice volume level and you would hardly miss a call even in a busy street. It's perfectly on par with the quality and loudness of the Sony Ericsson W850 loudspeaker which we reviewed not long ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calling our friend Dexter</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5300 could be set to accept an incoming call when you slide it open, something the W850 is capable of, but can also end the current call when you slide it down - something that W850 cannot do.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Series 40 user interface with an update<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standard standby screen shows the signal strength, the battery capacity, the date and the clock (digital or analogue), the carrier name, and the active profile (if different than Normal). The two soft keys can be assigned a function according to the user's preference. A wise choice would be to assign the Go To menu to one of the keys - this menu includes frequently used functions and is totally user configurable. The four ways of the navigation D-pad can also be assigned some functions. You may also want to place a cross with the icons of the assigned functions in the middle of the display - at least in the beginning while you remember them. The interface can be customized through graphic themes but they don't really change much - the only things that change are the wallpaper, the menu background and the color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Regular standby screen ? Go To menu ? shortcut indication</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Some of the available graphic themes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice innovation is that the S40 user interface now comes with support for Flash Lite 2.0 instead of version 1.1 - same as Sony Ericsson phones, so now it can use flash clips as wallpapers or screensavers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pleasant fact is that you can choose the colors of the text on the standby screen from a wide array of available colors. Unfortunately, changing the font color is not available throughout the whole menu and when using some graphic themes legibility is not perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Available font colors</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting option as regards the standby screen is the Active stand-by mode, where all favorite applications' icons, music functions, upcoming events from the calendar, and notes appear on the display - much like the one seen on Symbian phones with the third edition of the S60 Nokia user interface. When you have the Active stand-by mode switched on, pressing UP on the D-pad gives you access to the icon bar and your favorite functions such as the MP3 player, the FM radio or the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Shortcut bar can be placed wherever you want it ? the active standby screen is totally customizable </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu features a fixed set of items but they can be freely organized in four different ways: as a list, as a 3 x 4 grid matrix, as a 3 x 3 grid matrix with labels, and as horizontal tabs. The second option, a plain table without legends, permits the visualization of 12 icons en bloc and is probably the most space-saving one. Icons can be additionally reordered according to the user's preference. It must be noted that they resemble a lot the icons used in the third edition of the S60 Nokia user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Main menu different views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Font size is again subject of configuration. Inside the phonebook there are two font options, while in the message application and the Internet browser you can choose out of three. The largest font is truly large; on the other hand the smallest one permits you to see an entire SMS en bloc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Font size options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see, Nokia 5300 allows a great deal of user-configurable options and the interface may be greatly suited to the user's own taste.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ringing profiles include settings such as type of incoming call alert, ringtone, ringing volume and vibration alert, sounds serving Push to talk, messages, notifications and warning tones and the keypad sounds. A great thing about the profiles is that they offer timed expiration so you won't forget to turn the sounds of your phone back on after that all-important meeting. You can even set a profile to be turned automatically on once plug in an accessory as the charger, for example. The phone offers a dedicated Airplane profile that switches off all active network connections in order to use the phone as a multimedia/radio player only in environments that do not allow cell phones. When the Airplane mode is switched on a large Airplane icon appears on the top of the screen. There is even an option to make the phone ask you every time you turn it on whether you would like the phone started directly into the Airplane profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Some of the Profile settings ? profile expiration time</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice innovation to the S40 interface is the possibility to use video recordings as incoming call alert. We got to point out though, that video files do not have the best sound quality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The vast fields? of the phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5300 offers 1000 contact positions, which is twice more than the phonebook capacity of Nokia 6233 for example. As usual with any Nokia's phonebook, it can be organized in three different views: as a standard list, as a list of names with numbers, or as a list of names with pictures. Searching is performed by typing the first letters of the respective name. The phonebook can be ordered and searched either by first or last name. You can choose a default contact list - the one on the SIM card, the one in the phone's memory or both simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Phonebook: different contacts list views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact details can include five types of phone numbers, addresses, notes, a picture, a ringtone, etc. There is a field for entering a contacts birth date but there is no option to transfer it directly to the calendar. A nice feature though is the possibility to use video files as personalized ringing tones for contacts of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Some of the contact details fields</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer not to customize each individual contact, you could organize some contacts into groups and assign ringtones and pictures to the individual groups. When setting the ringing profiles you can select which groups will be able to reach you on the phone - in this way the groups serve as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can freely use the voice dial feature of Nokia 5300 for all the contacts since it needs no voice tag recording. If the required contact has more than one number, Nokia 5300 uses the default one after letting you choose for a couple of seconds. It is quite a pity that the number type cannot be selected with an additional voice order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is that besides Voice dial, you can use the Voice commands option, which is again speaker independent and can be used for voice control of a total of 16 preset phone functions like turning on or stopping the FM radio, the Infrared port reception, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Various voice commands</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calls management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The number of missed calls appears in a window on the main display. From here you can get to the corresponding log, where calls from the same number are grouped in one item accompanied by the date and the time of the last executed call. The same principle is applied for dialed and received calls as well. Each folder can fit in up to 20 items. And that is not everything. Nokia 5300 also offers a cumulative Calls Log, in which all call types, including multiple tries are organized in chronological order. You will also find a list of the recent Message recipients, as well as a counter for all sent and received messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Call log menu ? call log list ? message log</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging gets better and better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5300 works with SMS, MMS, emails, and Push-to-talk. In addition, it offers two special types: sound MMS and instant SMS. The instant messages appear directly on the main screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start a new message, first you are offered the opportunity to enter the recipient's number and then you can start typing your message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison to previous S40 Nokia phones where the message is started on a single line which gets extended further down on the whole display as the message gets longer, this time the place for typing is already stretched onto the whole screen. Messages are sent in the background which is really nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Messaging menu ? new SMS message ? available graphic emoticons </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When asked to type the recipient, you may type their phone number straight away, select it from the phonebook, browse groups, or look it up into the list of people, whom you have recently sent a SMS. The last option is particularly useful as people tend to write messages frequently to several contacts, which are in this case directly accessible. The editor counts down written characters and informs about the number messages that will be sent. T9 dictionary is also there to assist you and offers an extensive vocabulary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications about SMS delivery can be activated both individually for separate messages and generally for all outgoing ones. They appear on the display for a while and then get saved in the phone memory. The Delivery reports are stored in a dedicated folder, which makes their deleting quite easy when their time has come.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5300 features the new version of the MMS editor, called "Multimedia Plus" which shows you the exact content of the message that the recipient is going to receive. So making previews as in older Series 40 Nokia models is no more necessary. MMS can contain text, a picture with a size of up to 1280 x 960 pixels, a sound clip, a video record, a business card, and a note from the calendar. Multiple-page MMS are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client in Nokia 5300 is a java application and thus takes a bit longer to start; it is generally slower and it is not perfectly compatible with the rest of the applications in the phone. Nevertheless, the email client cannot be considered bad. It has POP3 and IMAP4 support. The email client copies email addresses from the phonebook and works with attachments. At the same time messages cannot be sent from the email field in the phonebook. Automatic download of email message is not available either. The email client offers automatic account configuration for the most popular email services providers but as it turned out with the Gmail it's far than perfect and needs further fine adjustment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no limitation in the size of the attachments to be sent. There is, however, a limitation to the size of the attachments that are going to be downloaded from the server. This limitation is user configurable but only up to 300KB. There is also a Spam filter which works by blacklisting the email addresses that you no longer want to receive mail from.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>And the main performer in tonight's show<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though music files can be directly played either from within the file manager, the best way to listen to music is by using the Music player. Forget the usual S40 music player. The new version is seriously updated meaning that now it's on par with the Sony Ericsson Walkman music player ver. 1.0. We must say that the new Walkman 2.0 player outperforms the Nokia one by a wide margin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player can play in the background and while doing that it would scroll the current track artist and title on the Active stand-by screen. Once it is in the background you can control it with the dedicated side music keys. In the meantime you can start a java application such as a game and enjoy it while listening to music. Turning the camera on pauses the player though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The supported file types are AAC, AAC+, eAAC, eAAC+, MP3, MP4, WMA, and AMR. The Nokia player allows you to filter available music tracks by Artist, Album, Genre and Composer. Beside that, you can create your own playlists or use the built-in playlist filters such as Favorites, Most played, Recent tracks or Recent additions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A serious drawback to the playlists management is that once you add some tracks to a playlist - be it a single one or several, you cannot add any more tracks to that playlist no matter what.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you minimize the player, the name of the currently running track appears on the active stand-by display. From active stand-by you can even choose to play the next track or fast forward or rewind the current without opening the player back. Repeating and shuffle options are available, too. If you stop the player in the middle of a song, the next time you turn it on, it would continue playing from the place it has stopped on. The music sounds very nice from the integrated loudspeaker and there is a certain bass element to it. Even at the loudest volume levels and you can hear virtually no cracks or creaks from the speaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The Music Player: main interface ? available options ? sort filters ? equalizer presets</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Listening to music with the Nokia HS-47 headset provided in the retail package of the phone is entirely a different matter. In reality they do their job on a satisfactory level, but it's got to be mentioned that the Sony Ericsson Walkman headset kits sound noticeably better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did a rather subjective quality test purely out of curiosity and let us tell you our opinion on music quality with the Nokia 5300. When we played one and the same song on the Nokia 5300 and a sample Sony Ericsson W900 which we had available at the time, the head-on competition was indeed lost by the Nokia 5300 when using the original headsets supplied with the respective phones. When we used a third-party full-size stereo headset on both mobiles, it turned out that they sound pretty much the same with no noticeable differences in quality or bass frequencies. That was the case though before we turned on the Walkman MegaBass preset which really made the W900 shine. But after playing a little bit with the manual equalizer on the Nokia 5300 we managed to achieve the same results by gradually gaining up the low and high frequencies. So in the end, it turns out that Nokia 5300 is a pretty good match for a Sony Ericsson Walkman handset when used with a regular stereo headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video in Nokia 5300 is played within an application called Media Player, which also supports streaming and can open pictures and play individual music files. The previous S40 Nokia phones had no option to fast forward videos but now you can set a user defined time jump with a minimum of 10 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Media player: main menu ? playing in portrait and landscape modes</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you get bored with the music/media player, switch on the FM radio. Here you can save up to 20 broadcasting stations. In general, however, it does not offer any special functions, not to mention RDS. Stored stations get saved with a user input name, so you can enter the station name and make up for the lack of RDS. The radio can be turned on only when the headset is plugged in since its cable serves as an antenna. Furthermore the radio signal cannot be transferred to a stereo Bluetooth headset due to limitations in its Bluetooth implementation. The radio application also supports the Nokia Visual radio feature, but in order to use it you need to establish a data transfer connection with a Visual radio server of the radio station, meaning that the station itself must support Visual radio broadcasting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The FM radio: tuning in a station &amp; playing in the background on the active standby screen </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A microSD card works miracles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The file manager is on a very good functional level. You can create folders, mark several or all files and then move them. Previous S40 models such as Nokia 6270 or 6280 do not allow marking several files and then mass send them through Bluetooth or Infrared. We personally think that this is a great improvement. You can sort the file list either by name, by date, by format, or by size. The phone has a limited integrated memory of 5MB but the retail package should include a microSD memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Checking free space on the memory card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the files and folders list either as a list with small thumbnails, as a list with details and larger thumbnails, or as a 4 x 3 grid matrix which offers the largest thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the pictures themselves in normal mode or in fullscreen landscape mode and move through the files with the help of the D-pad at a pace of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Gallery: different thumbnail views </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone allows you to either zoom in the pictures to their original size or set their contrast. You can even print the images through direct USB connection using the PictBridge standard. There is even a simple image editor, which allows for basic functions such as inserting text, frame, clip art or another image to an already existing one. You can also crop the existing image.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera: check<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5300 is equipped with a 1.3 megapixel camera. The maximum resolution is 1280 x 1024 pixels. Lower resolution as well as three types of compression quality is available, too. Furthermore the camera offers 8x digital zoom, which only makes digital crops of the original large image, so when you take pictures with the zoom used, you actually get a smaller resolution picture output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone takes pictures in landscape mode using the camera right side button as a shutter release key or the central OK button of the D-pad. The camera has a nice shooting speed. When taking pictures at the maximum resolution and maximum level of quality it takes around 3 seconds from pressing the shutter key to actually saving the picture on the memory card. When shooting in poor lighting conditions, the same exercise takes up to 4-5 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Camera viewfinder ? camera interface against a dark background</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5300 offers a night mode, a self-release timer, and an image sequence shoot mode. In the image sequence shoot mode the camera takes up to four photos in quick succession. The higher the resolution, the fewer photos you can take sequentially. At the maximum resolution the phone takes a total of two pictures. There are several white balance presets you can choose from along with an automatic mode. A good thing is the option to turn off the camera shutter sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides all that, the camera offers several image effects such as False colors, Sepia, Grey scale, Negative, and Solarise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The night mode in fact comes in quite handy when taking pictures in poor light conditions. In such conditions the pictures taken in Normal shooting mode have a lot of color noise. The Night mode improves the pictures a lot and we find it useful here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Camera menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the photos is below average. It seems that Nokia is using some kind of noise suppressing algorithm, which indeed reduces the noise significantly even in low light, but gives all the pictures quite smudged look. Moreover, in an effort to make the photos look more appealing, Nokia engineers have boosted the saturation levels and the colors look rather unnatural instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>            Nokia 5300 sample camera photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos are taken at 15 fps in 176 x 144 pixels resolution or in the even lower 128 x 96 pixels. We won't comment on those since this range of resolutions is pretty inadequate now. So frankly, try to forget that it even shoots video, unless of course you are in to multimedia messaging.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity on the bright side<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connectivity, Nokia 5300 has two versions - both feature tri-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support. The only difference is that the first one supports GSM 900MHz, 1800MHz, and 1900MHz networks, while the second one is targeted at the American market and supports GSM 850MHz, 1800MHz, and 1900MHz networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is equipped with a XHTML browser with WAP 2.0 support. The browser is simple, with three types of font size available. That said, we must point out that we are far from satisfied with the way it deals with general HTML sites. The best that it's capable of is just simply converting those to ones similar to WML WAP sites. Most of the sites are plainly unusable with some small exceptions. Searching with Google is a true nightmare too. Furthermore, you cannot use the browser in a horizontal mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia 5300 web browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5300 can also serve as a modem for establishing Internet connection from PC. The phone gets connected to a PC through Bluetooth, via the Infrared port, or by standard 5-pin mini-USB cable. Connection parameters can be configured manually, but you will save time if you use the Internet connection program from the PC Suite. A great feature is that you can now directly download updates of the phone firmware when newer versions become available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the handset has an Infrared port and Bluetooth 2.0+EDR connectivity for close communication with other devices. An impressive feature seen rarely in Nokia mobiles is the support for the A2DP Bluetooth profile, which basically means that you can listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. That being said, it's important to note that the A2DP support is going to be a distinctive feature of all the XpressMusic handsets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>There is an Organizer menu, you know<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5300 has a separate Organizer menu which includes applications to help you stay on schedule. The Alarm clock allows for only one alarm to be set but it can be repeated on given days of the week. Nokia 5300 will wake you up with a standard beep sound, with any sound saved in the phone, or with radio signal, provided earphones are plugged in. The snooze time of the alarm is also configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar application is nicely developed. The monthly view includes details like the weeks and the week days, while the Weekly view includes details like the days and the hourly schedule for those days. The week begins according to the wish of the user - on Saturday, Sunday or Monday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers 5 types of events: meeting, call, birthday, memo, and reminder. The last one, the reminder, is used for fast inserting something that has to be reminded of soon. It is quite useful since in other mobiles you often need to use the "meeting" option as a reminder one, which unnecessarily complicates things. The Reminder in Nokia 5300 includes the following details: subject, place, starting date and time, end date and time, reminder date and time, reminder type, repetition (never, daily, weekly, every two weeks, monthly, and annually). The phone offers synchronization of notes and calendar events with both a PC and a remote server.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The To-Do list is simple enough. Here you can only add a subject, a priority, a term, and a reminder type. Accomplished tasks can be marked off. List items can be ordered in alphabetic order or by deadline. Tasks are very easy to transfer into the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are quite handy, because they get synchronized with PC, which allows for longer texts to be downloaded into the phone. Font size is not configurable. Yet, in my opinion it is the text notes where three font size options would have been really helpful (just like in the SMS application).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia 5300 offers a voice recorder and as in all Series 40 Nokia models, the voice record duration depends on the available free memory only. The recorder cannot be used when a data call or GPRS connection is active but can freely be turned on during voice calls. It's up to your will whether the recordings will be stored onto the internal memory or onto the memory card. Nokia 5300 uses the .amr format and a one-minute recording uses approximately 100 KB of the memory. Here Nokia engineers could have designed the side button on the left side of the phone to start the voice record instead the Push to talk function or at least it should have been made user configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu also has a countdown timer and a stopwatch. The Java applications include a unit &amp; currency converter, a calculator, an Introduction and Sensor application. The Calculator is quite detailed, offering not only standard mathematic operations, but also work with powers, square roots, reciprocals, functions and memory functions. Yet, it ignores common operator priority. The Sensor is a Nokia Bluetooth application allowing for communication between two devices in close proximity. The idea behind it is that people that do not know each other can chat, exchange profiles, user data or mobile content. The Introduction is a special Flash-based tutorial on using the mobile's main functions. It is well designed and does its job.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>One of the things we missed is an application for viewing MS Office and Adobe Acrobat PDF files. Yet the phone allows you to read .txt files and we find that quite handy.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Having fun is what it's all about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 5300 supports Java 2.0. The test phone we got featured 3 pre-installed games: Pro Snowboard, Music Guess and Snake III. The Snake III game is a nicely elaborated 3D variant of the legendary Snake game and features interesting graphics, but disappoints when it comes to amusement. The controls are rather complicated and you can hardly get the apple you are after since the snake doesn't turn in the right moment you want it to turn. There are two in-game views available - one where the camera follows the snake's head and another one that watches the game sidewise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pro Snowboard is an amusing piece of sport action. You control your snowboard character to perform different stunts and tricks and collect power-ups and bonuses along the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Guess game is rather innovative. It takes the music files saved on your mobile and plays them to you while offering you a choice of several names to guess the correct name of the song. And not only that you have to guess the song's name but you have to do it fast to earn points. Each track is played for several seconds only.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At first glance Nokia 5300 failed to impress us with its design and the materials used for its body. In fact we think that the white color and matt plastic with rubber elements make it look cheap. It's not among the slimmest devices either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But armed with the highly user-configurable S40 user interface it scores even with the corresponding Sony Ericsson user interface and even makes a stride ahead. The menu is organized logically; functions are detailed, offering high control comfort and brilliant work efficiency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia advertisement campaign on the XpressMusic handsets clearly shows that they are made for young people having fun. The available microSD memory card slot, the miniUSB port and the standard 3.5 mm audio jack adapter make it great for enjoying music on the go. You can even fancy a stereo Bluetooth headset to go with it. The slider form factor would most definitely attract attention too, since the Walkman line lacks a slider in this price category. Summing it up, if you like the sporty design, Nokia 5300 is a highly attractive music proposal from the Finnish manufacturer and it definitely deserves your attention when picking up a new mobile this holiday season.</paragraph>
