			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>By losing an inch of screen diagonal and reducing the weight to something you might actually be able to hold longer than 5 minutes, the Galaxy Tab 8.9 hopes to convert more people to the tablet cause. Those who found the 7? Galaxy Tab too limiting and the 10.1? slates too heavy to take anywhere other than your couch will certainly appreciate the effort.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 3G at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android tablets may have been off to a slow start, but no one can deny that they?ve been improving at an amazing rate. Only a few months after the release of Honeycomb we already have at least a dozen intriguing tablets, including the Transformer with its detachable multi-functional keyboard, the Acer ICONIA Tab A500 with its competitive price and the XOOM with its hopefully-soon-to be-enabled LTE connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet the not quite polished Android 3.0 OS has been holding all those tablets back. Lagging, lack of support for all the features (like the USB host or microSD card) and low number of optimized apps used to be the deal-breakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, Google has already addressed most of the performance issues with the 3.1 update and developers have been hard at work on delivering those apps so iOS might finally get itself some proper competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good timing for the Galaxy Tab 8.9 then, which may as well see its prospects soar.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 8.6mm thickness, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 is the slimmest tablet we have seen and that?s a major boost in aesthetics. The ultra-thin gadget is a joy to behold and oozes the high-tech feel that?s a big part of the tablets? appeal to begin with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not just how it looks though ? the low weight of the Galaxy Tab 8.9 makes it extremely manageable. We?ve no reason to complain about the finish either. The back is made of plastic but metal would have made it too heavy. And low weight is an advantage this tablet wouldn?t want to lose because half of its edge would go with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while we still think the iPad 2 feels like the better built device, you can?t easily take away points from the Galaxy Tab 8.9? either. The premium look and feel is further reinforced by the magnificent PLS LCD screen. We?ll come back to it later, but for now we will say that it?s a strong contender for the best tablet display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Honeycomb can do without hardware buttons and it?s hardly a surprise that the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 carries very few controls. The two short sides are in fact completely bereft of any keys or ports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo speakers are on the bottom long end, either side of the Samsung proprietary port. By the way, with no hardware keys on the front and full-circle autorotation, there?s no clear-cut top and bottom. Anyway, front facing camera on top and connectivity port - bottom is usually the rule.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So ? a 2MP front-facing camera it is, more than enough for live chat and video calls. What we are not particularly fond of is the decision to use a proprietary port instead of standard microUSB. If a smartphone like the Galaxy S II can use a standard port for charging, HD TV-out and computer connections then why not give its bigger brother the same treatment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And no, power requirements are not the reason ? the BlackBerry Playbook can charge off a microUSB no problem. Samsung and Apple are still reluctant to follow suit though. Maybe we?re still far from a point where universal chargers are regulated for tablets as they?re for phones. Well, in Europe at least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top (landscape) side of the Galaxy Tab 8.9 is the busiest of all. The SIM slot accommodates regular-size SIMs, which gives the Galaxy Tab an edge over its main competitor, the iPad 2. Another advantage for the Samsung tablet is that it can do regular calls over the GSM network and video-calls over 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microphone pinhole and the 3.5mm audio jack are there too, along with the only two hardware keys on the Galaxy Tab 8.9: the volume rocker and the power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We complete our hardware inspection at the back where we find the 3.15 MP 720p-video-enabled camera. Tablets are hardly the most comfortable devices for taking pictures so the camera is more of an accessory than an essential feature. That?s why we?ve no reason to frown at the specs ? it?s as good as most users will need anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Near perfect display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are back at the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 PLS LCD screen of WXGA (1280x800 pixels) resolution. On paper that sounds like one of the best displays in the tablet class and we?re glad to report that its real-life performance is equally convincing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widescreen 16:10 aspect ratio is pretty convenient for watching videos, playing games and whatnot, but that has now become the standard in Android tablets anyway. It?s the image quality that stands out here ? probably the best we have seen so far from a tablet. And while it won?t match the Super AMOLED Plus of the latest Galaxy smartphone, it deserves credit as an LCD unit (LCD being the only kind of screen that currently sizes up to tablets).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast of the 8.9? display is high, colors are punchy and viewing angles are better than we?ve come to expect from tablets. The PLS matrix and the high pixel density certainly add up to a pretty good combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we were pleasantly surprised by the outdoor performance of the Galaxy Tab 8.9. The screen remained legible even in the brightest sun. It far ahead of the highly reflective screen of the XOOM and even inches slightly ahead of the iPad 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In conclusion, the Galaxy Tab 8.9 screen might as well enjoy its place at the top of the tablet food chain while it lasts. Of course there?s still plenty to do to catch up with smartphone screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And next on our list is the Galaxy Tab UI. Join us after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab 8.9 will ship with TouchWiz UI right from the start ? as opposed to the bigger Galaxy Tab 10.1, which will be launched unskinned. Google is keen to provide timely updates for the tablet-friendly version of Android so customizations are generally non-essential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, Samsung managed to sneak in a few elements of its own. Just don?t expect changes that run as deep as on their smartphones. There are some minor touches that should help the Galaxy Tab 8.9 stand out in the Honeycomb crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one can be noticed right on the homescreen and in the app launcher ? the taskbar at the bottom is no longer static. A swipe upwards flips it to its side to reveal six shortcuts. Clicking on any of them opens a widget window that you are free to move around the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the taskbar-docked shortcuts are the proprietary Samsung apps. They include the in-house task manager, world clock and the PenMemo app, as well as a calendar, calculator and a music player. All of them except the task manager have shortcuts to their respective fullscreen apps. Most of the functionality is overlapping anyway so you might not need to go there too often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been modified too to include the connectivity toggles that we?ve come to know from the smartphone edition of TouchWiz. They offer more functionality than the stock Honeycomb quick settings - including GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth controls - which saves you the extra effort of entering the extended settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons at the bottom left corner also have a new addition. We don?t know how many people other than reviewers and developers will find the new screenshot button useful, but it doesn?t hurt having it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the other buttons has remained unchanged ? back, home and task switcher is what you get with stock Honeycomb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search shortcuts (voice and text) are in the top left corner of the homescreen, while the app launcher and homescreen edit buttons stay in the top right. In-between is the final change brought by Samsung ? the dots indicating the number of available homescreen panes and the current selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher has seen no modifications at all, but there are plenty of preinstalled apps that cannot be found on other tablets ? Social Hub, Music hub, Pulse reader, AllShare, Polaris Office and Video player, My files. Some of the other apps like the music player and the calendar have been modified as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 also offers access to Samsung Apps ? the company?s own app repository. There are just 49 tablet-optimized apps there right now, but the good news is that they are all free and their number will certainly increase before the tablet hits the shelves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last two changes you will notice are the added Messaging app and the refreshed Contacts. Having a messaging app makes sense on the Tab 8.9, which is capable of handling SMS and MMS. The updated contacts app is quite an improvement over the stock variety too. Unfortunately, there?s no preinstalled dialer so you?ll either have to initiate calls through the contacts app only or you?ll need to download a third party phone app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: It appears that the native voice calls support didn't make it in the final version of the tablet. Either Samsung deemed it too unimportant on a tablet, or some technical difficulties with its implementation appeared, but you will need a third party app to make calls on the Galaxy Tab 8.9 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, the changes aren?t too dramatic but help make Honeycomb a more complete package. A dedicated video player and file manager are a real must and we can?t even figure out why Google left them out in the first place. A document editor can also be quite useful on a tablet and so can the PenMemo, which is the fastest way to put down a quick note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, if the multimedia department is doing equally well, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 will have a strong claim on the Best Android tablet title.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWizzed music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have blessed the Galaxy Tab 8.9 music player with a custom interface, which we find more functional than the stock Android one, even if it lacks the impressive cover-flow-like browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now sort your tracks by album, artist, song, genre, folders, composer or year. Playlists are here too and there are automatically generated most played and recently added lists. Naturally, there?s also a search option, which will be greatly appreciated by those with large music collections. It gets activated by pressing the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a specific album (or a group of tracks based on any filter) the interface splits into three screens - the filters on the left, the album in the middle and the now playing track on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the song name brings you to a dedicated now playing screen where you have a repeat (one or all) and shuffle options as well as a setting to add the currently playing track to favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizers are available too, along with various sound effects like concert hall, music clarity etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if there is a track playing in background a dedicated row appears in the notification area showing its name. Strangely enough though there are no quick pause or skip controls right there so you need to open the music player every time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player let down by the codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Stock Android Honeycomb doesn?t have a dedicated video player app so Samsung decided to write one of their own for the Galaxy Tab 8.9. Allowing for thumbnail, list and folder view modes it?s a pretty functional application. There?s also searching so even if you fill that ample storage with short clips you should be able to find the one you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the codec support is not much better than what we saw on the XOOM. With DivX and Xvid nowhere in sight you will have to either convert all your videos or get a third-party app for playing those, which will inevitably harm performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still if you stick to MP4 videos you might be glad to know that the Galaxy Tab 8.9 easily does even 1080p videos. If you get the TV-out adapter the slate might make for quite a powerful home multimedia center.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser does a splendid job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung didn?t bother with too much customizations for the Galaxy Tab 8.9 web browser, but then again this is one of the best parts of Honeycomb so it?s all cool. Even at this early stage browsing on the Tab 8.9 is an enjoyable experience. The interface is neat and simple and the full Flash support is more than welcome for experiencing browsing as it should be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser and opening a new one is as easy as clicking the plus sign on the right. The address bar and search bar are, as usual for Android devices incorporated in a single field, which scores another point for the Tab 8.9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks have their own screen and they can be organized in folders for easier navigation. History uses a split-screen interface letting you check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week. There?s also a most visited tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing the browser with your desktop Google Chrome doesn?t need any extra software ? you check a box in the settings menu and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also auto-complete for forms and passwords and you can pick the default zoom level for the browser. Not that altering the zoom is that hard with pinch-zoom, naturally, being supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing that is missing here is the alternative interface that Motorola XOOM offered. We are talking about the quick access to your page controls (back, forward, refresh, bookmark etc.) by a swiping gesture performed near the right edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash performance on the Galaxy Tab 8.9 was about identical to what we saw on the XOOM, which is hardly a surprise given the identical Tegra 2 chipsets inside. This means that you will be able to watch 360p and 480p Flash videos, but at least at this stage 720p or higher resolutions are out of the question.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3.15 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A 3.15 megapixel camera capable of doing 720p videos and a 2 megapixel front-facing snapper is what you get with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9. Given that tablets aren?t the most useful devices for taking snaps it?s probably as much as you are going to need anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two cameras are mostly there to provide the functionality needed for video-chatting and some augmented reality apps or games and the possibility to snap a label or two as a memory aid comes as a welcome bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is an oversized version of what you find on the Galaxy S II with the available settings on the left and the shutter key and the video/stills switch on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go a few samples to show you the image quality of the Galaxy Tab 8.9 camera. Have in mind that those were captured with a pre-release unit and the final unit will likely be able to produce better snaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately our Galaxy Tab 8.9 unit had some issues with the video recording so we are unable to provide you with a 720p sample.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There we are, about to split ways with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9. We have no reason to doubt this tablet?s prospects and, if the rest of its development goes according to plan, it might become one of the most successful Samsung devices of the year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And Samsung is not the only one who will benefit from the Galaxy Tab 8.9 in the long term. The right fit between 10.1? super slabs and 7? minis, this one seems to strike a perfect balance between usability and portability. Is this the birth of a whole new class of tablets? We can?t be certain but it looks like something many makers will be willing to consider. Look at the LG Optimus Pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus Pad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple will forever be remembered as the company that raised tablets from niche to mainstream, but Samsung should be credited for bringing plenty of innovation to the segment too. Last year it was the 7? Galaxy Tab that almost made some people give serious thought to ditching their smartphone altogether and now we have this little fella to give everyone else an option to consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 is still being tested ahead of official launch and there?s a big part of the equation missing. All those words of praise will be easily forgotten if the Android 3.1 Honeycomb update fails to bring the performance boost that we are hoping for. Even the greatest hardware (and the Galaxy Tab 8.9 is pretty good) could be reduced to a useless pile of chips by laggy unfinished software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet the story of Android thus far is assurance enough that this won?t be the case. The droid smartphones came from behind to leapfrog the competition, so there?s no reason to doubt Google?s determination to achieve a similar feat with tablets.</paragraph>
