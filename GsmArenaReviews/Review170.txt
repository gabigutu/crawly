			<paragraph>Market leaders Nokia are usually among the key news makers at the Mobile World Congress. By using a clever marketing move to postpone the announcement of their 8 megapixel flagship Nokia N86 8MP for the second day of the MWC 2009, they really got all the attention to themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we gotta admit Nokia, you really had us there for half a day, fooling us into believing that you won't be revealing an all-in-one flagship as an answer to the pressure of other manufacturers such as Samsung and LG.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N86 8MP<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP leaked yesterday with its full specs available, however it was only today that we could lay our hands on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The goodies on board the Nokia N86 8MP include 8GB of internal memory, a microSDHC card slot, a 2.6-inch OLED screen, FM transmitter, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 3.5mm audio jack and TV out. There's also quad-band GSM and tri-band HSDPA support for a truly worldwide voice and data roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photography-wise, the N86 8MP promises unmatched performance that's closing the gap between cameraphones and point-and-shoots. It's the first and only cameraphone to offer variable aperture values and a 28mm wide angle lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see the difference the wide angle lens makes when compared to a regular cameraphone lens. Here are two samples shot simultaneously from one and the same position with Nokia N86 8MP and another Nokia phone. The samples are downsampled to 800x600 pixels. Guess who's got the wider lens!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first benefit of the variable aperture (going through F2.4/F3.2/F4.8) is that at F2.4 the camera has more light to work with as compared to the standard F2.8 value of all cameraphones we've seen. The second benefit is that when there's enough light and the aperture closes a bit (F3.2/F4.8) the resulting images are usually sharper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are several full-res camera shots taken with the Nokia N86 8MP at the Nokia booth. If you go through the images EXIF data however you would see that it says Nokia N85 instead of N86, and the aperture value is F2.8, which doesn't really match what Nokia advertized. We guess the N86 units we saw are too early to really show their potential. Some of those were labeled as Nokia N85 8MP straight on the front panel - so it's understandable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual slider design has been a traditional Nokia thing ever since the original Nokia N95. It's a really cool solution and with the Nokia N86 8MP the keys have excellent ergonomics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We actually loved the Nokia N96 kickstand, and you can bet that we dig the N86 one as well. By the way, the Sony Ericsson W995 also has a clever kickstand solution that's worth a look as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP runs on the Feature Pack 2 of the S60 Symbian user interface. It's nothing new actually, but what you may notice about all new Nokia smartphones announced this week is that they have some newly customized interface graphics and it's all about transition effects. Every Nokia smartphone comes with different set of transition effects and they all look lovely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's all about Ovi as well - Ovi integration can be spotted throughout the whole user interface, and there is even an Active Standby plug-in now that shows how many of your your Ovi Chat contacts are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N86 8MP is one really nice smartphone with rich equipment. Perhaps the only disappointment is the screen size - we couldn't help but sigh over Nokia N95 8GB 2.8-inch screen. Camera-wise N86 8MP seems to shorten the distance to point-and-shoot digicams quite successfully. It's camera performance is yet to stand trial by fire but the specs look just impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing that seems to be missing from the Nokia portfolio now is an 8 megapixel cameraphone with full touch UI - something along the lines of Samsung Omnia HD.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E75<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E75 is an old acquaintance of those of you that have been following our daily news reports, as it has leaked numerous times online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interesting thing about it is that all those countless leaked photos haven't done it any justice at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality the Nokia E75 is actually a pretty stylish, pocketable device that has a really user-friendly QWERTY keyboard. We initially thought it's going to be big and really thick, but none of those turned out true.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E75 comes with a spanking new email client that easily hosts more than one email accounts - Microsoft Exchange and regular public emails such as Gmail work seamlessly together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new thing about the Nokia E75 is that the Nseries image gallery has finally made its way to non-Nseries phones, and you can find it on board the QWERTY slider as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably already know the Nokia E75 will be available next month at an estimated price of 375 euro before subsidies and taxes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E55<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E55 seems to be one of the most interesting devices by Nokia at this MWC if you ask us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an intriguing ultra-slim design and a QW-ER-TY keyboard, this new E-series communication device promises both rich functionality as well as pocketability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can imagine, the Nokia E55 has the same new email client as the Nokia E75. The application packs some really nice graphical UI and offers all advanced features a modern email client should have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E55 has a semi-QWERTY keyboard, which thanks to the large keys manages well on usability level. We had our doubts when we first saw its pictures, but in reality we are quite pleased with it. The device also offers simultaneous predictive input for two languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably already know the Nokia E55 will be available in Q2 2009 at an estimated price of 265 euro before subsidies and taxes.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 classic and 6710 Navigator seem to be slightly revamped editions of the similarly equipped 6220 classic and 6210 Navigator, announced last February.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beside the fact that the two are among the first Nokia smartphones to come with the latest Nokia Maps 3.0 pre-installed, they have already received some UI enhancements.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6720 classic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6720 classic upgrades the 6220 classic with tri-band UMTS support and HSDPA 10 Mbps, or as Nokia call it - Turbo 3G. You will also spot the new curve in the design that's supposed to enhance handling. In reality, it feels nice in hand but we don't really notice that huge of an improvement. There are some new product colors in the mix as well. The plastic now looks a bit classier and doesn't feel as cheap as the one on the original.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than all that the new Nokia 6720 classic runs on the same Symbian S60 3.2 OS as the original but as all other Nokia smartphones today, it has received a faceliftt of all graphical icons so that they look exactly as the Nokia S60 5th edition touch UI used on Nokia 5800 XpressMusic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last small change is the beefier battery of the Nokia 6720 classic, which has gone from 900 mAh in 6220 classic to 1050 mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably already know the Nokia 6720 classic will be available in Q2 2009 at an estimated price of 245 euro before subsidies and taxes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6710 navigator<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The situation with the Nokia 6210 Navigator and 6710 Navigator duo is quite similar. The newcomer has a similar design but a bit more curved and it has the same dimensions but new colors. The most serious upgrades are (1) the display has grown from 2.4 inches to 2.6 inches and (2) the camera has gone from 3 to 5 megapixels (but video recording remains unchanged).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display upgrade was definitely needed as the 6210 Navigator had too small a screen to be used comfortably as a car navigation unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.5mm audio jack on top of the original 6210 Navigator has now been replaced by a more standard 3.5 mm audio output jack on the Nokia 6710 Navigator. The addition of 3.5mm audio jacks and microUSB charging are two things that Nokia seem to really implementing on a wider scale lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no change in the battery department here, however Nokia promises twice the talk time and twice the standby time with the new Nokia 6710 Navigator as compared to the original 6210 Navigator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably already know the Nokia 6710 Navigator will be available in Q3 2009 at an estimated price of 300 euro before subsidies and taxes with an all-you-can-eat turn-by-turn navigation Nokia Maps service.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just to sum it up, the upgrades that the 6710 and 6720 represent sound really nice, but seriously, why bother make new products in such small increments? Obviously Nokia N79, N85 and 5800 XpressMusic will be the driving force of the midrange Nokia portfolio in the first half of this year.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 6700 classic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While at the Nokia booth at MWC 2009 we also spotted the recently announced Nokia 6700 classic and Nokia 5630 XpressMusic and we couldn't help but stop by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 classic is offered in three color versions - silver metallic, matte metallic, and black metallic. While black is fashionable as ever, our appreciation goes for the matte metallic version, which not quite obviously is the last one on the left. Unlike the silver one, it's quite fingerprint resistant and it looks extra nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 11.2mm, Nokia 6700 classic feels amazingly thin. Despite the size however, it's got a really nice feature pack. A 2.2-inch QVGA screen plus a 5 megapixel camera and GPS receiver with Nokia Maps for S40 sounds attractive enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the 6700 classic has a high weight for its compact dimensions and it really feels heavy in the hand. But it's not necessarily a bad thing as it actually added for a feeling of solidness. The main body panels by the way are made of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like all latest Nokia S40 phones, the S40 UI has received some graphical make-up and now resembles the S60 5th smartphone touch edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia seem to be staking a lot on social and sharing websites such as Facebook, MySpace and YouTube as well, as the Nokia 6700 classic has mini applications to access those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably already know the Nokia 6700 classic will be available in Q3 2009 at an estimated price of 235 euro before subsidies and taxes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 5630 XpressMusic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's really impressive how compact smartphones get these days. At 12mm of thickness, the Nokia 5630 XpressMusic is almost as slim as the Nokia 6700 classic, however it's quite lighter. The 5630 also has the same 2.2-inch display of the 6700, but goes a bit lower with its 3 megapixel auto focus snapper. However, it also offers a standard 3.5mm audio jack plus N-gage gaming support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5630 XpressMusic pioneers the innovative feature Say-and-Play, which allows you to search through your music collection using voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5630 XpressMusic also has a new Active Standby plugin called the Contacts bar. It hosts the images of contacts of your choice. When you select a contact from the bar, you get access to all past communication with that person, including calls and messages. Among the contacts details you can even find a live RSS from the person's blog or website for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5630 XpressMusic will also be sold as a Comes With Music device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably already know the Nokia 5630 XpressMusic will be available in Q2 2009 at an estimated price of 199 euro before subsidies and taxes with a 4GB microSD card included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, that's it for today's walk in Nokia camp.</paragraph>
