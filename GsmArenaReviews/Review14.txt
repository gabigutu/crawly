			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Long-time Sony Ericsson users may find the Hazel the perfect cure for nostalgia. Monster gadgets like the Vivaz and the XPERIA X10 are trusted to get the brand back on track. But for all we know, it takes a good old-fashioned slider to rekindle the romance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hazel falls in the company?s GreenHeart line of phones. The echo-friendly vibe is perhaps supposed to make up for the missing Cybershot and Walkman magic. The green credentials are all there anyway. The phone is made of recycled plastics and uses waterborne paint. There?s a power-efficient charger in the tiny, shipping-optimized retail box and no user guide (it?s on the phone?s memory instead of being printed on paper).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GreenHeart is Sony Ericsson?s way of saying they care. We all do ? but a phone is as likely to save the planet as it is to give you a direct line to Elvis. Either way, it?s not the phone?s fault. So, the Sony Ericsson Hazel will be considered for what it is and what it does. Not for the color of its heart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Hazel isn?t just another feature phone. It can?t afford it on a market like today?s where cheap smartphones and touchscreen lurk behind every corner. GreenHeart implies some sacrifices but users won?t have to give up on phone features. The Hazel is a high-performance handset with an ample 2.6? mineral glass covered scratch-resistant display solid imaging and all sorts of connectivity options. Not to mention it?s totally weather-proof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of connectivity, the Hazel sure is a handful. Along with the HSDPA/HSUPA support (for data transfer speeds reaching 7.2 Mbps), the slider also boasts Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and a built-in GPS receiver to top it off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Hazel knows social networking is essential these days and it gives it all ? right on the homescreen. The nifty widget set gives you on-screen live updates from Facebook, Twitter and MySpace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Sony Ericsson Hazel has its flaws as well, and we?re not going to let them by. But before we dig in deeper, let?s first take a look at the retail package and check the phone?s build and feel. Jump to the next page for a chance to see the Hazel from some new angles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tiny retail box with not much in it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Hazel package fits the ?eco-friendly? bill. It?s really tiny and made of recycled paper. Inside, there?s the energy-efficient charger and a basic pair of headphones with a FastPort connector. The phone comes with an electronic in-phone manual to cut the usual paperwork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no data cable supplied. That would?ve been no problem if the Hazel had a microUSB port. In this case you could?ve used any compatible cable. Unfortunately, the Hazel?s FastPort means you?re in trouble unless of course you?re upgrading from an older Sony Ericsson phone. That?s not exactly eco-friendly either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Hazel 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Hazel is a rather chubby slider measuring 102 x 49.5x 16 mm. However, the unusual curved design makes up for that. The phone fits snugly in the palm with the keypad slid both in and out. It is still a reasonably pocketable slider. The weight of 120 g might sound a bit too much but it actually makes the phone feel quite robust.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Two color options are announced for the Sony Ericsson Hazel - Superior Black and Passionate Rouge. It's pretty similar to the paintjob selection for the Elm. Red is perhaps not everyone's (or should we say "men's") cup of tea but the black version is certainly looking to respond to unisex demand. By the way, it?s more of a black on silver ? the rear and the numpad are finished in silver, with subtle matching accents up front. Another thing to note rearside is the fine grooved pattern ? it looks great and gives the user a better grip too. Just like the Elm, the Hazel's body is said to be splash resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An underlying feature of the GreenHeart duo is the ergonomically curved rear: human curvature as Sony Ericsson call it. As soon as you hold the phone in your hand, you'll get the point. The handset fits your palm nice and tight and in the case of the Hazel, makes sure to slightly raise the keypad for better comfort. Nice, indeed!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ergonomic curve and a few shared styling elements are not the only things the new GreenHeart duo has in common. In fact, both devices have the same list of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we should note though. Almost the whole rear of candybar Elm is made of metal for a very solid upmarket feel. There's a bit of faux metal finish on the Hazel but it's actually all plastic. Real metal would've perhaps made it too heavy ? the Hazel isn't slim at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen there is a neat and spacious navigation deck centered around a rectangular D-pad. The layout is clean and very user-friendly. All keys are just the right size, comfortable and responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad is equally impressive. Buttons are flat but well sized and solid to press, so quick typing on the Hazel is a cinch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson Hazel features nothing but the regular FastPort. A standard 3.5mm jack / microUSB combo would?ve fitted an eco-friendly phone like the Hazel much better but users are in no luck. So much for the green side of it ? using proprietary connectivity ports is everything but eco-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset is the top side in digicam terms. It hosts the volume keys and the camera button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker feels somewhat stiff, but it?s nothing to hurt usability. Pressing the volume keys in power-saving mode shortly brings up the clock and notification icons (if any) on the otherwise completely blank screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is very comfortable - with a soft but distinct half press for autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Backstage we find the 5 megapixel autofocus camera lens, accompanied by a LED flash. The loudspeaker grill is also here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the Sony Ericsson BST-43 1000 mAh Li-Polymer battery. It is quoted at up to 450 hours of stand-by and up to 10 hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, battery life ranged over three to six days on a single charge, depending mainly on multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nearby is the microSD card slot which is ready to accommodate cards of up to 16GB of memory. The phone worked pretty well with our reasonably full 16GB microSD card. The only downside to mention here is the fact that you have to remove the back cover to get to the microSD card. It?s totally hot-swappable though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM compartment is under the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have no issues with the build quality of the Sony Ericsson Hazel. It?s an all plastic phone but feels quite solid. And the hand feel is near perfect. The curved shape and friendly controls make it especially comfortable to operate. The smooth and solid slider run and the nice numpad are worth noting too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would have preferred a standard 3.5mm audio jack over the proprietary port, but at least you get an adapter in the retail box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A vibrant 2.6-inch display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Hazel comes with a 2.6" 16M-color display of QVGA resolution. The size is a serious advantage: nearly unmatched by feature phones and easily putting some smartphones to shame. The Hazel display is also covered with mineral glass and is said to be scratch resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dry facts aside, the screen is gorgeous: image quality is remarkable. The QVGA resolution is hardly anything to write home about but the crisp and vibrant images are what really matters here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hazel display is also really impressive with its sunlight legibility. Out there in direct sunlight, the Hazel screen puts to shame pretty much all Sony Ericsson feature phone displays we've seen so far. It's easily on par with the iPhone's screen in this respect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The regular user interface, with some widgets on top<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Hazel uses the regular Sony Ericsson feature phone UI that's used in most of their midrange handsets. The Flash UI is well familiar and deservedly praised for its looks, speed and multitasking ability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with information on top indicating signal strength, currently used data carrier and battery status. At the bottom of the display, just above the context keys are their labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard foursome - theme-dependent, 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating view features three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden, just as an indication of what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar featuring tiny icons for the other main menu entries. Neither of those view modes works with shortcut keys. Only the Grid view allows quick numeric keypad access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode can only work with a SIM card in the device and requires a restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is visually appealing and snappy. There?s auto rotation in the Media Center and it is generally quite responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one important upgrade on top of all that - the homescreen widgets. Sony Ericsson tried this concept on the C901, where the Facebook app had a handy homescreen shortcut with live updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are now a total of five homescreen widgets: Calendar, Walk Mate, Facebook, Twitter and MySpace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of the preloaded widgets takes almost the whole standby screen, so you can only have one visible at a time. But they can all be working at once and easily switched between using the D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get to select which widgets will be active and you may choose to enable all of them. Pressing the Up key on the D-pad, lets you manage the widgets and set their behavior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar widget is a shortened version of the actual app, showing the upcoming events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Walk Mate should be familiar to Sony Ericsson users ? a simple step-counter, which works in the background. It has a green twist this time around and is aptly called Walk Mate Eco ? it converts your walking exercise into saved CO2 emissions. Which of course only makes sense if you?re walking outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three social widgets are convenient shortcuts to the actual Facebook, Twitter and MySpace apps, with on-screen live updates. They show your friends? profile pictures and their latest activities ? just like the Facebook app on the Hazel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Standard-issue phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way, you can set up the phone to autosave to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up your entire contact list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact employs a tabbed interface that?s well known for anyone that has used a Sony Ericsson handset in the past couple of years. There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and, finally, the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you can add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of the contact is written in only one field, but you still have the option to order contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and it does it very well. Naturally, you can search the contacts list by gradual typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling of calls is excellent and we didn't experience any voice quality or reception issues with the Sony Ericsson Hazel. Call clarity is great in both the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hazel uses the company?s proprietary NoiseShield technology for active noise cancellation. The option for toggling that on and off is only available during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality it does a nice job. If you are in a high-traffic street turning the shield on will reduce the ambient sounds up to 60-70%, without muffling your voice. Nicely done!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hazel offers video-call functionality and, unlike the Elm, it also features a front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing or ?Smart Search? as Sony Ericsson call it, is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed Call Log application should be familiar too if you've used a fairly recent Sony Ericsson handset. It uses four tabs for All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to or from a single contact, only the last one gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional speakerphone test with the Sony Ericsson Hazel. However, the maximum volume was a bit disappointing and the device scored below average. Here is how it compares to some of the other handsets we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about the test itself and the whole list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical of the latest Sony Ericsson phones, the Hazel sports the threaded message view. SMS to and from a certain contact is organized in speech bubbles much like in an instant messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between the conversation-style layout and the regular Inbox is only a matter of toggling a tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting fact is that if you get a reply while you're still in the thread, it will be automatically added to the conversation just like a chat, instead of appearing as an alert on the home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson Hazel offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts and the option to assign categories to messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manage Messages application enhances message handling. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact. Categories also allow quick and comfortable sorting of messages with separate folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course predictive typing. The SMS and MMS messages share an editor; when composing SMS you can easily convert it into an MMS via the options menu or using the attach-stuff toolbar below the text box to insert images, animations, videos or sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone automatically retrieved the settings for our Gmail account. The options to view messages full screen and change font size really helped get a lot of text on the screen. Even at the smallest font setting text remained legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email you get the Manage Email feature, which has the same functionality as the one for text messages. Saving attachments is problem-free, even if the file type is incompatible with the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Sony Ericsson Hazel (much like all other Sony Ericsson feature phones) can't preview any documents including the ones attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of a document reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Media Center<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Hazel runs the flash-based Media Center to bring together all the media content on your phone (Photo, Music, Video, Games, RSS feeds). The Media Center settings menu is simple ? you may opt for portrait, landscape or auto-rotate modes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music Player on the Hazel is the latest Walkman version. Across the Media Center menus, you can enjoy screen auto-rotation. The player supports numerous file formats, including the regularly used MP3, WAV, WMA, M4A and E-AAC plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening. The player can of course be set to run in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface colors of the Media center vary across different themes. The Walkman player on the Sony Ericsson Hazel also offers fun styles ? skins that change the look of the player into a vinyl record player, a reel-to-reel tape player, CD player and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone lacks a standard 3.5mm audio jack so you won?t be able to use your favorite headphones unless you get an adapter. There is no shake control either, despite the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A familiar Walkman goodie, SensMe, offers a different approach to populating a playlist. It automatically generates playlists based on what tempo and what mood you want ? fast or slow, sad or happy. Songs need to be tagged, which is only possible with the Sony Ericsson?s PC software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is also available ? it analyzes the song currently playing on the radio or whatever it picks up with its mic and retrieves the performer and the name of the song.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player in the media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, and the interface is simple and stylish. The video files are accessible via the file manager too. Other extras include fullscreen mode and screenshot capability - you have the option to save a frame of video and add it to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there's no XviD or DivX support. Sony Ericsson are keen for you to use their MediaGo desktop software to transfer any video from a computer to the handset in the correct format and resolution to be played on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our review of the desktop application proved it does the job alright, but there's still more to wish for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to our Hazel now, the Media center video section also houses the pre-installed YouTube client. It gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarked favorites and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery stores the shots you've taken, along with prebundled or uploaded images, and offers some extra options like mark as favorite and photo feed. Latest Photo provides quick access to the most recent photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year and when a month is open, it reveals a 3 x 4 grid of photo thumbs. Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the corresponding month with the currently selected photo slightly enlarged for better viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures section is a 3 x 4 grid of thumbs with non-camera images such as the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the fullscreen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Photo gallery can get quite laggy when there are a lot of photos in a folder. At times, the phone froze for a couple of seconds before moving on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Photo gallery is a richly-featured tool for managing your photo collection and it offers very good customization capabilities. Photo Tags displays previously marked favorite photos. The sending options include Send as Picture Msg, as Email, via Bluetooth or even to web albums (Picasa, Blogger or Flickr).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Hazel is capable of embedding standard GPS coordinates in images. When browsing tagged images in the gallery, the View-on-map option displays the location where the picture was taken directly on the preinstalled Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, picture browsing via the classic file manager is still possible, but we are sure only a few users will make use of it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of Sony Ericsson Hazel has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has a nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player but offers none of the fancy fullscreen graphics the player does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is accessible through its original location in the entertainment menu. It also offers the online search option. It allows fast search in the entire database for artist, album, title, and lyrics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Superb audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unsurprisingly the audio quality of the Sony Ericsson Hazel is identical to the one of its bar-shaped brother, the Elm. The handset performed excellently in each and every part of our traditional tests, recording some of the best results we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is perfect for the entire audible range, the greatest deviation being hard to detect even in lab conditions. The signal-to-noise ratio is also excellent and so are the dynamic range and the stereo crosstalk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distortions are also neatly kept under control and if it wasn't for it being slightly on the quiet side we would pronounce the Hazel as the perfect portable audio player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson Hazel and Elm frequency response graphs match perfectly</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information about our audio quality test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A remarkable 5-megapixel shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Hazel has a 5-megapixel camera capable of producing images at a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. The handset is equipped a LED flash, which also serves as an auto-focus assist light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP autofocus camera offers a lot of extra features such as smile shutter, face detection, auto-rotate, macro mode, spot metering, image geotagging, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera toolbar at the bottom gives instant access to shoot mode, scenes, picture size, focus, flash, self-timer, metering mode, white balance, effects, and settings Multi Menu. The Hazel doesn't have a manual ISO setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus mode has an extra feature ? Face detection. The face recognition system allows you to simultaneously track as many as 3 faces but focus is locked on the one that's closest to the center of the frame when the image is captured.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using Smile Shutter is easy ? to activate it you press the camera key all the way down and release it. A small on-screen blinking yellow icon indicates that the mode is on and the phone will automatically snap the photo as soon as it "spots" a grinning face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GPS geotagging is available too. Just remember it?s assisted lock so it involves a small amount of data traffic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated macro mode in the Hazel allows you to take images from as close as 10 cm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Hazel has strong imaging credentials. The solid image quality compares favorably to the top 5-megapixel cameraphones on the market. The photos have pleasant colors and look very sharp, with the noise well under control. The amount of resolved detail in the center of the frame is excellent, comparable to the best in class ? the Sony Ericsson C901 and the Nokia 6700 classic. Unfortunately the Hazel suffers from corner softness and the amount of resolved detail falls drastically towards the edges of the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Sony Ericsson Hazel. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Hazel is also capable of shooting video, and it actually does that quite well. The Hazel captures VGA videos at 30fps (stored in mp4 format). The LED flash can be used in video mode too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality and the resolved detail look good, but the compression sometimes is too high. Still the captured videos are mostly satisfying and that?s more than we expected from a Sony Ericsson feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch connectivity, almost<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Hazel is not an Internet-centric device but scores high on connectivity options. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board for worldwide roaming. 7.2 Mbps HSDPA, as well as 2.0 Mbps HSUPA are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, the Sony Ericsson Hazel offers the usual Bluetooth v2.1 and USB options. There is also A2DP support for stereo audio streaming. Last but not least, there is also the microSD card slot, which is often one of the quickest ways of transferring data ? never mind that on the Hazel it?s under the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hazel supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. Unfortunately, the Hazel uses the old FastPort and there is no data cable bundled in the package, so you will need to buy one separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite the USB disappointment, you can sync your device via some of the popular exchange services such as Google. We successfully configured our Google for exchange account and the Elm retrieved our preset contacts, calendar events, Google mail along with the settings almost immediately. The two things that were left out during the sync process were the contact pictures and birthdays. We guess you?ll need to add them manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Hazel boasts premium features such as Wi-Fi and GPS with A-GPS support. Unfortunately, Sony Ericsson Hazel allows you to watch streaming media (of any type) only over the EDGE or 3G connection (even though Wi-Fi is listed as an option, it just doesn't work). So in essence - you cannot watch the streaming video (such as YouTube) over Wi-Fi. You can browse youtube.com over WLAN but as soon as you select a video to watch, it loads in the YouTube client. And it just won?t work over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Media Home app uses the DLNA capabilities of the Hazel to share media with other DLNA-enabled devices such as phones, home players or TV via Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser preinstalled on the Hazel is the same as Yari's - an updated version of the popular NetFront 3.5 mobile browser. It offers a much smoother experience than before and renders web pages faster. Almost every time it nails the zoom level for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen, right under a search and an address bar. They grant access to free content, such as clips, tracks and games on the Sony Ericsson site, including a step-by-step guide for setting up email accounts or internet connections. The appearance of the home screen changes to a different bright color each time you start the browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equipped with a mouse pointer, the new NetFront 3.5 web browser always operates in fullscreen mode and the four most important features are easily accessible on a toolbar - mini-map, address field, favorites and downloads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, you can find some extra features, such as mark-and-copy, save image or find on page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an automatic RSS finder. If you browse an RSS enabled site, a small RSS icon will appear. If you click there you can access all the available RSS feeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser has full Flash support, although all of the YouTube videos redirect to the mobile streaming app. Still if you open any other website with Flash videos you?ll be able to play them directly within the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the Flash content runs trouble-free and all, but streaming videos (both actual Flash and those in the mobile YouTube app) can only use a 3G connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said before, watching streaming videos is possible only over EDGE or 3G connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Hazel offers a wide range of time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Java Applications, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Calculator and Torch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you enter a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts you to add it to the calendar too. There is just one general-purpose type of entry in the Calendar, but it features enough details. Notes are composed similar to messages and the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms application hardly needs any introduction. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one. It offers the basic functions, no bells and whistles, but you can run the Converter from there. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the familiar basic applications. The Voice recorder has no limit on recording length, making the available free memory the only restriction.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tons of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for the additional applications, Sony Ericsson Hazel comes with AccuWeather, a Calendar Wallpaper, Checkbook, EcoMate, GreenCalculator, Grocery List, NeoReader, Standby World 3D, Tracker and YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AccuWeather application gives you up-to-date weather information for locations of interest. An overview of current conditions and a three day forecast are available for a great number of cities around the world. You should bear in mind that the data is downloaded in real time so charges apply. Not that we can think of any other way for the application to work but we still feel a warning is due.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar Wallpaper puts an analog clock on the homescreen. Using the built in accelerometer, you can switch to other views ? calendar, tasks and last photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Checkbook allows you to create different accounts, enter a balance and start managing your income and expenses. There is also a chart for easy time tracking of your transactions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EcoMate is an educational green app. You have a pet (panda in this case) and you must answer a few questions every day to support its virtual habitat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GreenCalclulator and Grocery List speak for themselves, while the NeoReader is a barcode scanner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Standby World 3D is a nice application with readings for up to three different time zones around the world. The background changes as day turns into night in the selected locations. You can set this app as a default background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last app is the Tracker. It requires GPS data and tracks your route as you exercise ? jogging, running or bicycling. You can view your previous routes as well as a summary, which includes things like Total, Average or Best lap time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation costs dear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Elm features a built-in GPS receiver. Its sensitivity is decent enough and with A-GPS enabled, it managed to acquire a lock almost instantaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hazel is equipped with the Wisepilot navigation software and offers all the features you'd expect in a proper SatNav solution. There's voice-guided walk and drive navigation, maps are courtesy of NAVTEQ, there's 3D view of the maps, extensive route-planning settings, speed camera alerts, POI and weather. SatNav software is a rare sight in a feature phone - installing one yourself is near impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its main downside is that maps are not stored locally but instead are downloaded over the air. A flat data fee is recommended but 1MB of data should get you about 600km of navigation. Still, we would have liked to have a map downloader as well, like with Nokia Maps. It really would have helped in avoiding data roaming charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also wish there was a built-in compass like on most of its.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wisepilot for Sony Ericsson comes on a 30-day trial, beginning the first time you start the app. After this month expires you will need a subscription ? 3 months in Europe will set you back 19.95 euro and for North America 3 months cost 19.95 US dollars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After Nokia released their Ovi Maps with full voice-guided navigation for free this just seems way too expensive. For almost 20 euro for 3 months we at least expected to get to download the maps. The data charges (especially in roaming) really ramp up the price of the whole thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is included as well if you prefer it.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Hazel has only one Java game preinstalled ? the Quadrapop. It?s a Tetris replica, this time with some colorful creatures instead of bricks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Hazel looks likely to succeed. It's got what it takes to please brand loyal customers plus the feature set and styling make it appealing to a wider audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There must be enough potential upgraders around looking for a replacement of their ageing Walkman or Cybershot handsets. But it's not necessarily a strictly family affair for the Hazel. Some people are just indifferent to touchscreen or don't care for smartphones. A phone with the Hazel's list of features may sound just right for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Solid imaging, excellent 2.6" screen (for a non-touch feature phone), full-suite connectivity and widget-enhanced SNS make up quite a hefty package. And the initial street price is quite adequate (around 200 euro). Prospective buyers may be further enticed by the GreenHeart badge. The eco-friendly vibe aside, it sure helps the phone stand out too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not essential though. There's actually little real up-to-date competition if you don't count touch phones - which is a different market altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, to put the Hazel into context, it's the phone to consider if you're coming from a Sony Ericsson C903. The upgrade value is undoubted. We're talking a bigger screen, better video capture and Wi-Fi support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A year ago, the Hazel would've been lost in the shadow cast by the LG Crystal. Today, the Crystal is still a potential threat, given the inevitable price drop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another possible rival is the smart Nokia 6700 slide which we just recently reviewed. It is based on the S60 platform, its body is made of metal and, like the Hazel, the smartphone has a capable 5-megapixel sharpshooter on board. However, the 6700 slide is short of Wi-Fi and has a smaller screen. There's no GPS either but in the end, the Nokia handset costs less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W995 is another slider that easily comes to mind when looking at the Hazel's potential competitors. SE W995 costs only 30 euro more, but it delivers almost the same specs along with an 8 megapixel camera and a built-in kickstand. Yes, you lose the splash-resistance, the active noise cancellation and the SNS integration but in the end it's a matter of priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson C903 ? Nokia 6700 slide ? Sony Ericsson W995</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some candybars are worth your thought too - the Sony Ericsson Elm and Nokia 6700 classic. Both of them are feature phones, and both have great 5-mepgapixel autofocus snappers. There's plenty of metal used on both of them too. Like the rest of the competitors so far, they have smaller displays. The classic Finn hasn't even got WLAN support. On the other hand, they are both cheaper than the Hazel.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Last but not least is the LG KM570 Cookie Gig. It sports a 3-inch resistive touchscreen and its 5MP autofocus camera is capable of shooting D1 videos at 30 fps. It also features a 3.5mm audio jack and Dolby Mobile sound enhancement. On top of that, you can get it for a bit less than you would pay for the Hazel.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Rich functionality meets eco-friendliness in the Sony Ericsson Hazel. But more importantly, this is a phone to help loyal users regain their confidence in the brand. Priced right, attractively packaged and full of features - the Hazel is likely to do well for the company and for buyers.</paragraph>
