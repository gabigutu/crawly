			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 brings several firsts for the company. This is the Finns' debut in phablets, the first WP quad-core device and the first one to rock a FullHD screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 builds upon the design philosophy of all previous Lumia flagships. It features a solid unibody construction with a colorful polycarbonate casing. The PureView camera on board, complete with optical image stabilization, promises great low-light experience, while the top-notch display should help the 1520 deliver the best Windows Phone experience around. Services and apps like Nokia Camera, Storyteller and Cinemagraph add even more value to the package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first let's get the technicalities out of the way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1520 at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 6-inch diagonal and has FullHD (1920 x 1080 pixel) resolution, which allows for a ppi of around 368 ppi, meaning no pixels will be visible. The bigger screen estate and higher resolution result in a third column of Live Tiles being present on the Lumia 1520 start screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6" ClearBlack IPS display offers low reflectivity and very wide viewing angles. It's covered with Gorilla Glass 2 for scratch resistance and can be used not only with bare fingers but also with gloves, thanks to the Super sensitive touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto the back where one of the most interesting assets of the device lies. The 20 MP camera with OS makes great use of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chipset and provides shot to shot times far shorter than those of the Lumia 1020.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stay tuned - more live photos and hands-on videos of the Nokia Lumia 1520 will be coming to the following pages very shortly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 1520 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 is a big handset by every standard possible. Thanks to its sloping edges and slim profile, guys with large hands could manage the Lumia 1520 with one hand, but even they won't find it too comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When compared to the 6.4" Sony Xperia Z Ultra, the Lumia 1520 suddenly doesn't look all that big. The Xperia is a good 16.6 mm taller, 6.8 mm wider and 3 g heavier than the Nokia Lumia 1520.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display on the Xperia Z Ultra is noticeably bigger and the device is also much slimmer at 6.5 mm (vs 8.7 mm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, the Lumia 1520 is a good 11 mm taller and 6 mm wider. Finally it weighs 41 g more, which is a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 feels flatter compared to the Lumia and its sloping edges. The plastic on both feels completely different - the Note 3 has a textured back, emulating leather, while the Lumia 1520 is either matte or gloss with no textures or patterns.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1020, Nokia's supreme cameraphone, already felt big in the hands but looks much smaller overall when faced with its bigger brother.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However at 10.4 mm the Lumia 1020 is much thicker, which adds the sense of it being bulkier than the 6-inch Lumia 1520.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the Lumia 1520 feels built like a tank. It feels extremely solid in the hand and very pleasant to the touch. We have no doubt it will hold up greatly against everyday wear and tear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 comes in four colors. Two of them are glossy and feel rather slippery - White and Red. The Black and Yellow color options, on the other hand, have a nice matte finish to them, just like on the Lumia 1020.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 packs a much larger 6" display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and a pixel density of 368 ppi. Compared to the Lumia 1020's screen, this one is immensely more impressive - the sheer size and the extra sharpness make a notable difference that even an untrained eye can easily spot. The display also offers excellent viewing angles and vibrant colors up there with the best in business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side we find the nanoSIM and microSD card slots under pop-out lids. The right side holds the power button, a single piece volume rocker and two-step physical shutter button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back has a nice flat surface, which slopes only at the edges. On the bottom lies a micro-drilled louspeaker grille, while on the top there's a dual LED flash and a slightly bulging camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the Lumia 1520 sounds quite impressive. Nokia has placed a 20 MP 1/2.5" sensor with 6-element F/2.4 Carl Zeiss optics, which make for a very wide-angle 26mm field of view.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We were able to snap a demo video of the Nokia Lumia 1520 on site at the Nokia World showroom floor. Check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had a chance to take a look at the other three color options of the phablet. To start off here's the other matte device of the bunch - the black model. It feels very nice and grippy in the hand and we like the way the ClearBlack screen fits nicely with the black sides and back of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The red and white variants of the Nokia Lumia 1520 look really nice but feel subpar in the hands due to their glossy finish. They feel slightly cheaper and a little slippery, especially given the sheer size of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even with the glossy topping, the sloping edges, the flat front and back and the overall thin profile of the Lumia 1520 feel equally sturdy as with the matte variants.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys on the sides of the Nokia Lumia 1520 are made of the same ceramic material we saw on the Lumia 920, 1020 and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a look at the accessories Nokia showed beside the Lumia 1520. They are the flip cover that moonlights as a kickstand, the wireless charging pads and external battery packs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We snatched two images off the Lumia 1520 - they were both already in the phone. They both fall into the low light category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images are both around 5 MP, captured with an exposure time of around 1 second and at the low ISO 200. It's not the full 20MP resolution so the noise levels have benefited from the oversampling. But even for an oversampled image they show amazing low noise levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The details are really impressive as well. The optical image stabilization has done its job really well and any blurring is practically unnoticeable (but they've probably used a tripod to shoot them anyway). Every little detail on the scene is nicely detailed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, these are sample images that Nokia has on the devices on display here at Nokia World so they might not be an absolutely real-life testament to the Lumia 1520 camera prowess but they give us a nice idea of what to expect. Their EXIF shows they've been through Adobe Photoshop Lightroom for some reason, but we'll give them the benefit of a doubt until we have a chance to see the Lumia 1520 in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go two more samples from the Lumia 1520 camera. The last one we shot in 5 MP resolution but in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The first one looks really nice but as it's a sample already preloaded on the Lumia 1520 we can't vouch for it being a credible real-life example of the camera's prowess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last image, which we took was shot indoor without flash under artificial lighting. The camera went with ISO 100 and again we can see great potential, loads of detail and low noise levels, again, thanks to that oversampling of pixels.</paragraph>
