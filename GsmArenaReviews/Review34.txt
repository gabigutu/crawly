			<paragraph>Enter a new platform. With a boom. With a bang. A Bada kind of bang. Another of the big guns wants to play by their own rules. Samsung?s second spot in global market share was hard fought but it will be a while before they as much as wish the same for the Bada. They?ve been a consistent innovator over the last couple of years but getting baby Bada up and running must be quite a challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave is Bada?s carrier vessel and it certainly looks interesting. It seems to have the right thing to make it newsworthy: slim profile and an absolutely gorgeous screen. But is it enough to make it a success?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over the past years new touchscreen platforms have been spreading like wildfire but not all of them have managed to catch on as well as their developers must have been hoping. Android fares well but still hasn?t quite overcome its growing pains, while the well settled Symbian platform is still coming to terms with touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 05 March: We received a second Wave unit after this preview was originally published. The new sample had a properly working camera and comes with the final design of the product (some slight changes). We've updated most of this article to match the more recent device. We've replaced the photos and the screenshots plus we've added new sections on the camera and the preinstalled applications. Have a look around!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S8500 Wave at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The S8500 Wave is among the best spec?d Samsung phones we?ve seen and it seems every aspect of the overall performance will have to pull its weight. Samsung are keen to focus attention on the young Bada OS, and that might as well bear future fruit. However, if the young platform fails to perform as expected, its shortcomings will be harder to forgive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the geeks' world 720p video recording and 1 GHz CPU are probably the best remedies for a few usability issues. However they rise the cost of the device and that in turn prevents some people from purchasing it. And in a market where smartphones come in all tastes and flavors you really want to get you device in as many pockets as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let?s not get ahead of ourselves and make hasty conclusions. We?ll hopefully know more about how Samsung will pitch the first Bada phone to the users so let?s waste no more time. Join us after the jump for the hardware inspection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung S8500 Wave 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 118 x 56 x 10.9 mm Samsung S8500 Wave is pretty compact and easy to slide in most pockets. The extra slim waistline contributes the most to this impression but there isn't much space wasted around the screen too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung were obviously not cutting corners with design and the S8500 Wave is a pretty sleek device indeed. The slim metallic body is elegant and solid, and well resistant to fingerprints too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any full-touch phone, the front of the Samsung S8500 Wave is dominated by the 3.3? touchscreen. And just a look at it is enough to prove us wrong ? the device does have a killer feature, only it?s not evident by just scanning the spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.3? 16M-color capacitive touchscreen on the Samsung S8500 Wave is pure perfection. Hard as we tried, we just couldn?t find anything wrong with it. And certainly couldn?t think of anything at least remotely similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AMOLED display technology has a great edge over LCD as far as contrast is concerned and that?s no news. But the S8500 Wave has the deepest blacks we have seen yet on a mobile phone. Of course, next to - say - the Omnia HD the difference isn?t so great, but it?s still noticeable. Besides, this time brightness got a boost too, which makes the S8500 Wave display image quality all the more impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles are also the best in business, outdoing the previous standard-setters by a wide margin. You can check out this short video comparison of the S8500 Wave display and an Apple iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8500 Wave screen sensitivity is impressive too, but that?s to be expected in a capacitive unit. The phone will respond to even a gentle click with a fingernail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come to sunlight legibility, which has probably been the weakest spot in any Samsung display so far. And the S8500 Wave was quite a surprise here too. Not only is this the most impressive unit indoors, but it doesn?t even lose a bit of its charm out in the bright sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So all in all, we are impressed by the Samsung S8500 Wave and its screen. In a crowded market where even the smallest improvements are a welcome rarity, this display is simply revolutionary.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Under the display we find the only three hardware keys on the Samsung S8500 Wave front panel. The Call and End knobs are either side of the menu key. Those are all large enough and with good press, so no usability issues are to be expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether or not you will like the transition between touchscreen and hardware keys is another question but it doesn?t have a straight answer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display are the earpiece and the video-call camera, along with a couple of sensors. Those weren?t functional on our unit so we aren?t able to tell what exactly they do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung S8500 Wave features the volume rocker, which is admittedly a bit too thin for our liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two buttons on the right side. Our early pre-production sample had the camera key missing, but now it's in place. The other key on this side is the screen lock button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the microUSB port, hiding under a small plastic lid, the uncovered 3.5mm audio jack and the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave rear only hosts the camera lens. There is a small LED flash next to it to boost its low-light performance but we shouldn?t be expecting miracles here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover gets released by pressing a small knob at its bottom. Under it are the microSD card slot and the 1500 mAh battery. At this stage of the handset?s development it is impossible to comment on battery performance but a 1500 mAh unit should be able to keep the power-efficient AMOLED display going for quite a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the microSD card slot is below the battery so hot-swapping is out of the question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Samsung S8500 Wave is commendable even at this early stage and we only hope they keep it up. As far as hardware is concerned, the handset actually delivers more than expected and that?s rare to be seen recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for the software side of things - the Bada user interface awaits on the next page.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: TouchWiz just got smarter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We guess it's fashionable to roll out new operating systems. Google stepped up with Android, Nokia are making a new start in touchscreen with the Maemo, HTC have gone a step backwards with the Brew Mobile (is this an operating system at all?). So, it was about time Samsung introduced their own OS as well. Meet the Bada OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get it straight, the Bada OS looks just like TouchWiz - with even more eye candy and with the option of running native apps on it. Samsung are waving the "Smartphones for everyone" flag but maybe it has less to do with affordability than ease of use. It took five minutes for the S8500 Wave to feel like just another neat touchscreen feature phone Samsung seem to have in excess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a short video shot in our studio demonstrating the new Bada interface and its capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a way, it did feel like a revamped Samsung i8910 Omnia HD too: the Omnia HD has TouchWiz running on top of Symbian. Though the performance of the S8500 Wave is unmatched by the Omnia HD in every respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At its launch the Bada application store will offer around 100 apps and this number will grow with time. Our test unit couldn't bring us to the Bada app store so we were unable to even take a look at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you know what to expect in a device that screams TouchWiz: not one, not two but as many as ten homescreens full of widgets. Only this time, widgets don't hide in a tray at the side but at the bottom - we saw a similar solution for the first time on the Samsung S5620 Monte.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other novelty is the notification area. It's is a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info like battery, time and switches for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. When you pull it down you get a list of all recent notifications. Did we hear Android cry thief?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the most recent events or the minimized music player, for example, the notification bar also gives you a convenient 3-button control used for turning Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or sound alerts on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you activate Wi-Fi from the dropdown, you get a list with all available networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TouchWiz or else, we're talking smartphone, so real multitasking is one thing you can count on with the S8500 Wave. The task manager is accessed by a long press on the Back button so you can easily switch between currently active applications or terminate them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is flat, all available items and applications initially spreading across three screens of icons. If needed, you can add up to 7 more. Icons form a 3 x 4 grid and you can change their order the way you like, you can also move icons from one screen to another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling the menu screens is looped, so when you reach the last one you don?t have to sweep all the way back.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Capacitive touchscreens usually won't give you handwriting recognition but the S8500 Wave is among the few exceptions. It certainly doesn't have the largest screen possible but handwriting recognition is there. As expected, you can hardly draw more than one character at a time but that's still something!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer typing to drawing, go for the on-screen keyboards. You get two options - a portrait numpad and a landscape full-QWERTY keyboard. Given the not so big screen, the the QWERTY keyboard is not the most comfortable. The keys could've been a bit bigger and better arranged - after all, the messages you compose don't need that much space.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is smooth and sweet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery or Media Browser, as Samsung call it, is basic - all images and clips are displayed all at once as small thumbs. When you select a file you can see it in either portrait or landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports pinch-zooming alright.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia on the go<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Multimedia is certainly a S8500 Wave forte. The brilliant display is great for watching videos. The interface of the video player follows the logic of whole UI. Settings and options are a tap away, otherwise hidden when not needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave supports DivX/XviD files out of the box. Subtitles are welcome as well. Interestingly, you can search for a specific scene using the "Mosaic search" feature. It breaks the clip down to 16 or 36 parts and displays the first frame of each to help you find the scene you're looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has been redone as well. Tracks are sorted by albums, artists, genres, composers, etc. You can hide some of those sorting options if you don't use them. At the end only those that you've marked will be displayed on top of the screen (as tabs) while the ones you have unmarked will be gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The major improvements however are only visible when you use the music player in landscape mode. Comparison to iPhone's Cover flow is inevitable with some important differences. Browsing albums or tracks is pretty standard in portrait mode: you get a list of all songs or albums, each with a small thumb. The list is smoothly scrollable with impressive kinetic effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're browsing in landscape mode you'll be getting an album art arch of virtual CDs. Tapping on a CD will expand it to show all the tracks within the given album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, sweeping down across the screen (from the arrow above the central CD) will display a virtual dial to let you search the albums or tracks alphabetically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are multiple equalizer presets (called "Sound effects" here) including Wow HD, Mega bass, Bass enhancement, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A promising 5-megapixel sharpshooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The second Samsung S8500 Wave unit we accommodate at our office turned out a pre-marketing sample as well. However, this one has an operational camera along with the previously missing camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave is capable of taking 5 megapixel photos and capturing 720p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8500 camera viewfinder is quite reminiscent of company's recent cameraphones. The comfortable interface is nicely touch-optimized and has all you need on the two vertical bars on each side of the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The basic options are here - ISO, white balance, default storage, stabilizer, face and blink detection, geo-tagging etc. You can switch the default storage between the main memory, the built-in 2 or 8 gigs flash storage and the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave produces splendid photos (for a 5-megapixel shooter). The amount of resolved detail is good even at this early stage and even noise levels are kept under control. Only the colors could be a tad more vibrant. Here go the Samsung S8500 Wave samples.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung S8500 Wave. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave captures 720p videos. Like the Sony Ericsson Vivaz, the S8500 Wave features continuous autofocus during video recording, which allows it to act just like a dedicated video camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung are still mum on the video frame rate. Our unit outputs videos at 30fps but under closer inspection of those, there seemed to be only 24 unique frames while the 6 other were duplicates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But having a steady 24fps is actually a good thing as it provides for a relatively smooth playback. After all, big screen movies are all shot as 24 fps. The Samsung Omnia HD was also trying out for a 24fps output but it hardly reached that with its videos running around 20-22 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough talking, here's a video sample made by the Samsung S8500 Wave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check these two video samples that we shot at the MWC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a second camcorder sample, this time shot outdoors:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-you-can-eat connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones are usually well-heeled in terms of connectivity and the Samsung Wave is no exception: all contemporary means of data transfer are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All kinds of network connectivity are at the user disposal - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSDPA (7.2Mbps) and HSUPA (2.0Mbps). The GSM/EDGE networking of course comes in quad-band flavor and the 3G in dual-band - 900/2100MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wave is the first mobile phone to support the new Bluetooth version 3.0. Naturally, A2DP is also supported. To activate Bluetooth (and Wi-Fi), you can use the dedicated control hidden in the notification area on top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S8500 also packs a standard microUSB port. You can choose from 4 connection modes - Media player, PC Internet, Mass storage and Samsung Kies. Samsung Kies is the new software used to connect your Samsung mobile phone to a computer. Interestingly, in mass storage mode the phone mounts its internal memory (2 or 8 GB, depending on the device) and not the memory card inside it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi with WPS is also at hand. WPS stands for Wi-Fi Protected Setup and it's a hassle-free way to pair a wireless device with your secured network. As long as your wireless router supports the feature, pressing the dedicated button on it allows it to pair with the Samsung Wave.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung S8500 Wave packs a Webkit-based Samsung Dolphin Browser 2.0. You can have multiple pages opened at the same time and there is Flash video support on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser interface is reminiscent of the Samsung S8000 Jet. There's multi-touch support, so you can make use of the pinch-zooming feature. That's only one of the three zooming options, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 10 March: You can also double tap a block of text or an image and the handset will automatically zoom in on it. Another double tap and you are back to the previous zoom level. And last but not least, there comes the one-finger zooming which works flawlessly as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another letdown of the Samsung Wave web browser is the lack of auto-complete when typing the address of already visited websites. The only help you get here is the ".com" button which can, eventually, save you 3 extra taps, nothing more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The System Manager was the first telltale sign the Wave is actually a smartphone. It consists of three tabs. The first one shows the battery info, while the second and the third inform you on the CPU usage and the memory status, respectively. Along with the CPU usage you can also see the currently running apps and you can start the Application manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice Command application does what its name suggests. With its help you can dial a contact from your phonebook or a phone number. You can also load a playlist into the music player or make the phone tell you what's on your schedule and which events you have missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the same app you can also start the Voice recorder or activate the Driving mode. If the Driving mode is on the phone will automatically read out all new notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our unit came with the Route66 based Samsung Mobile Navigator aboard. Though its maps graphics have somewhat outdated looks, feature-wise there's really nothing missing. It has voice-guided navigation and a huge number of additional features (such as the weather service, traffic info, safety cameras info, travel guides, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Mobile AP you can turn your S8500 Wave into a wireless router.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the newer Wave version we took for another preview wasn't final, too, so we won't be able to try out the Bada App store, as well as the SNS apps so stay tuned for our review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8500 Wave is an interesting device indeed. Performance is pretty good even at this early stage and we take it as a promise there will be little to complain about in the end. While the limited 3rd party software puts it to a disadvantage, the impressive display and the latest Bluetooth 3.0 seem the perfectly good reasons to give it a try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, Samsung better learn from their mistakes and provide better support for it than they did for the Omnia HD. A pretty amazing piece of technology itself, the Omnia HD failed to generate as much developer interest as Samsung must've hoped. In the end, it was never able to live up to its full potential. They did indeed come up with new firmware but it was both late and poorly distributed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, users should hope Samsung S8500 Wave and Bada OS in general has better fate and receives the after-sale support that it deserves. When you develop a new OS from scratch, making updates convenient for both users and developers is vital.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other vital thing is to attract a large enough user base so developers feel motivated to write apps. With this kind of potential, a proper sales strategy can do wonders for the S8500 Wave.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, but what about the Bada OS. The key thing at this point is it's welcoming and familiar, a smarter TouchWiz as we know it. We guess, it will be as good as the applications that will run on it. But that's yet to be seen. The Bada OS is perhaps a must-have for Samsung. And Smartphone for everyone is perhaps more than a slogan. Just look at where Nokia are heading with the Cseries.</paragraph>
