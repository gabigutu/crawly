			<subsectionTitle>Press conference<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson kept its tradition of holding a press event right before the start of MWC and doing its announcement business there. This year we got the Android-running XPERIA Neo and XPERIA Pro, plus the full specifications of the gaming-centered XPERIA Play. The XPERIA Arc also made it on some of the slides, even though its official announcement came more than a month ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We pretty much knew what to expect way before the event with previews of all newly announced handsets spreading online like wildfire. As we anticipated the side-sliding XPERIA Play was the star of the show, while the other two headed for the lower market segments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many of the Sony Ericsson partners also appeared on stage, praising the XPERIA Play gaming potential and declaring their support for the project.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way all three new devices run Gingerbread, which comes to show that Sony Ericsson has learned a valuable lesson with its X10 flagship last year. Now they are going for the latest and greatest that the Google OS offers even if that means dropping a few of their home-backed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the most surprising part of the event was the announced partnership between Sony Ericsson and Verizon. The CDMA-loving US carrier get the XPERIA Play, somewhere in April.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other markets will be luckier though, getting the new Sony Ericsson as early as next month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson also used the occasion to remind us all once again that their goal is to become the number 1 Android manufacturer in the world and the newly announced handsets are just another step towards completing the plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well at least you can?t blame them for lack of ambition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now for the really interesting part ? the hands-on photos of the new handsets. We are starting with the XPERIA Play right after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play features a 4" FWVGA screen, but strangely is the only one of the newly announced devices not to pack a Reality display. Sony Ericsson says sacrifices were necessary if they were to get all the gaming potential they wanted in the little fella and obviously their latest display technology didn't make the cut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And speaking of gaming potential - the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Play is certainly the device with the best game controls we have seen. You get a D-pad, touchpad (plus, of course, an ample touchscreen) and action buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we aren't particularly sure about the Adreno 205 GPU that's assisting the 1 GHz Scorpion CPU. We feel that a dedicated gaming device deserved a far superior GPU so it would be able to run more elaborate games. Still the ones demoed on the XPERIA Play at the Sony Ericsson event were all very cool and none of them had any issues whatsoever with the performance so we might be getting too picky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another great thing about the XPERIA Play is that it will have access to some great games (including Sony PS One titles).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We played a few very quick games on the XPERIA Play and they all seemed pretty enjoyable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo has been called a Vivaz successor but it's a droid all over. The 1GHz (single-core CPU) inside the Neo runs Android 2.3 Gignerbread with Sony Ericsson's customized UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the looks of it the XPERIA Neo will be a down-to earth version of the XPERIA Arc. You lose the inwards curved back and ultra slim waistline, but you are probably getting a better price for the exact same feature set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson plans to launch the XPERIA Neo in a three different colors and luckily all of them were present at the event. There's the smartphone bold red version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's the more conservative black color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the plastic used in all three cases, sleek as it may look at first, is way too prone to fingerprints and smudges. It only took us a minute with each of the color versions to go from perfectly clean to greasy mess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo packs an 8MP Exmor R camera, which can record HD video.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>XPERIA Neo second encounter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the XPERIA Neo, Sony Ericsson have concentrated on improving the UI, polishing the multimedia apps (gallery, music and video players). Sony Ericsson also did a lot of work on the overall performance of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Neo runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread with Sony Ericsson's latest User Experience Platform (or UXP). The new UXP has new features that improve the usability - simplified menu with handy sorting options, pinning a folder to the bottom of the screen is space efficient and the Overview mode (like we saw in the XPERIA Arc) is a great way to navigate your homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Neo, which demonstrates some of the new features:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pro<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Pro is the new QWERTY droid from Sony Ericsson, which features basically the same specs as the XPERIA Neo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the four-row rubbery QWERTY keyboard to be pretty comfortable for typing. The general performance of the device also seems pretty decent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pro will come with an Office document editor out of the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>XPERIA Pro second encounter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA Pro is Sony Ericsson's second QWERTY-packing Android and they've incorporated the same UXP improvements as in the Neo, with focus on performance and multimedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But they've also incorporated some really clever features in the email client on the Pro. In landscape mode, the email client is divided into two panes - the left houses a list of emails, while the right displays the currently selected email (similar to how desktop clients work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you slide the keyboard open while in the email client, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Pro will bring up options to reply to the current email, all emails or forward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the video demo to see the cool email client in action along with the other improvements to the phone:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also stumbled upon the Misty Silver version of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA Arc and though you might want to check it out. We certainly find it way better looking than the Midnight Blue unit we previewed.</paragraph>
