			<paragraph>Being the best equipped handset ever Nokia N73 has managed to overrun the king of all mobiles - the slider Nokia N80. It features Symbian OS, 3 megapixels backed up by the label of Carl Zeiss, USB Mass Storage, and works with office documents. Nokia N73 has a brilliant phonebook and a good time organizer as well as an exceptional Internet browser. The interest in this new Nokia phone is overwhelming worldwide.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The time has come<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N73 is a smartphone. It features the latest version of the OS many used to blame for lack of applications, namely, Symbian S60 3rd Edition. Well, there is no need to worry about its compatibility anymore as there are already a sufficient number of new or adjusted programs for the above mentioned Symbian version on the mobile market. If you appreciate constructional extravagances, you'd rather turn your attention to the slider Nokia N80. The new Nokia N73 is rigorously classical: its dimensions are 110 x 49 x 19 mm; weight is 116 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nokia N73 live</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N70 has been on the market for about a year now - a period considered necessary in the mobile world for the replacement of one mobile generation with another. For some people the successor of Nokia N70 is Nokia N80, but according to me it is rather Nokia N73. N73 looks like a standard square, but looked from aside it has the shape of a trapezoid. I like its color variants as well as the design of its body: its front side is thin, while both lateral sides together with the rear cover are always elaborated in a different color. The model we were delivered for the tests has a silver front plate and violet-brown back and sides. Another possible color combination is white &amp; red (emanates young and sport spirit).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   All-side view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to our evaluation Nokia N73 is the best mobile phone on the market; it won the competition with the queen Nokia N80 with a result of 93 %. It is clear that no evaluation could be absolutely objective as one always implies their own preferences, but there is no doubt that Nokia N73 has the best equipment among all 200 mobile models that have been tested in our office. It is simply the new mobile king. What's more, it is by 130 euro cheaper than the former winner Nokia N80. (Please note, that Mobilmania.cz takes different approach in evaluating the mobile devices compared to GSMArena.com, their rates are set by the editorial staff, not by the visitors)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Company speaks about this phone as of a "multimedia computer" because of its extensive functions: photo camera, simple video calls camera, Web browser, primitive game console, MP3 player etc. I myself prefer to stick to the standard denomination "mobile phone" or possibly "smartphone". Any cons?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front plastic cover is not made of stunning material. On the other hand, it does not look as cheap as the material used for the numeric part of the keypad (comment still to come). The only elements on the left side of the phone are the Infrared port and the eyelet, in which a wrist or a neck strip can be inserted. The original package includes a wrist strip only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The phone held in palm ? comparison with a credit card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Infrared port ? eye-let for strip</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side you will see three buttons: a volume control button in the top and a camera release button together with a key for instant access to the image and video gallery beneath. A longer press on the release button activates the camera interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Camera release button and access to Gallery ? volume control</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A smartphone of a conservative look, Nokia N73 has also been given a sport touch thanks to the original color combinations applied on its covers and the perforated plates on its top and bottom, whose material imitates metal. On the top you will find two stereo speakers, between which is located the Switch On/Off button. A fine grid covering the microphone is located on the bottom side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Nice imitation of perforated metal plates</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the grid you will find the Pop-Port connector and the charger slot. The type of charger Nokia uses in its recent models is very easy to break due to its small diameter. Along with the handset, in the original package you will also find a USB cable for connection to a PC and a pair of stereo earphones with a remote control, which can also serve as handsfree. An adapter for a standard charger is present, of course. The package also contains a cleaning cloth with a Nokia logo and slogan, and a CD with PC Suite and drivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Accessories from the original box of Nokia N73</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia phones have rarely been spoken as of devices of ideal body construction or perfect part hold. Yet, Nokia N73 appears to be an exception to this rule; its construction is very good; all parts stick together the way they should but one - the sliding cover of the camera, whose looseness reminds me of Nokia 6681. More details about this problem can be found in the chapter devoted to the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Battery and SIM card bed. Common use requires charging every second day; during the tests I had to charge the phone every night</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Camera cover is naughty as usual</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Buy one of your own<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The original package of Nokia N73 does not contain a memory card. As a matter of fact, Nokia is not the only important mobile manufacturer to take such a decision recently. On one hand it is explained with the fact that most users who buy "multimedia computers" hardly ever make do with enclosed memory cards of 64 or 128 MB and usually get themselves an additional, bigger card. On the other hand, however, Nokia could have equipped the phone with a 512 MB memory card, just like Sony Ericsson does with the Walkman series.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Step by step Nokia is abandoning the so-favorite RS-MMC format; instead it begins to use miniSD. Please note that both mentioned formats are absolutely incompatible. Already in the review commenting Nokia N80 we mentioned the looseness of the cover of its memory card slot. In Nokia N73 the situation is pretty much the same: the oblong cover hangs on a very thin plastic part as a result of which it may be lost anytime. Just like in Nokia N80 the N73 model features an option (user-configurable) called "Extract memory card".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;Memory card slot ? cap is fragile ? miniSD card ? slot is illuminated</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card can be extracted while the phone is running, but its removal requires closing all active applications. Its cover is not easy to open, so longer fingernails are a sure advantage. The memory card slot gets attractively illuminated thanks to the side-effect created by the keypad backlighting. It looks cool. Statements concerning internal memory are contradictory. The manufacturer announces 42 MB, while other websites publish different numbers. The indicator in Nokia N73 shows 47 MB available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>No need to wait for VGA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia has been long stuck to the resolution of 176 x 208 pixels in all its smartphones. In fact, so long that in the end the rest of the popular manufacturers began to score better. A decisive change came last year with the launching of Nokia N90, whose resolution was 352 x 416 pixels, that is, four times more pixels than before. Anyway, most current smart models feature a QVGA resolution (240 x 320), which is also the case of Nokia N73. The display size is overwhelming; due to its 37 x 49 mm it looks like a pretty large screen. The design of the display is so brilliant that it creates the feeling that it simply could not have been made any bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resolution is fine; its pixels are only visible through the macro eye of a standard camera. The human eye is not so perfect... Besides, while observing the display of Nokia N73 I kind of stop waiting for VGA resolution; it will not be necessary except on bigger displays or should you need to fit onto the display a huge amount of information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since Nokia launched its 6681 model the brightness of its smartphone displays has been constantly deteriorating. For example, neither Nokia N70, nor Nokia N80 could compete with Nokia 6681. It has not been till this last model, Nokia N73, that brightness - in highest resolution - it can be again considered comparable to the brightness levels shown by the above mentioned model. Bear in mind however, that legibility of N73's display remains rather poor under direct sunlight, even though it is far better than in models like Sony Ericsson P990 or Sony Ericsson M600, where direct light makes reading virtually impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Display is large ? its screen in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Located above the display are the manufacturer's logo and the name of the model, both present in most recent Nokia models. Next to the earphone with a tiny silver cover there is a sensor detecting the intensity of the surrounding light. In accordance with the level of this intensity it activates the keypad backlighting. Situated nearby is a new state diode identical to the one used in Nokia N80.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Speaker, sensor of surrounding light, diode, and tiny VGA camera </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The time, during which the display remains illuminated (from 5 seconds to one minute) as well as the interval, in which the screensaver gets activated, is user-configurable. The screen saver represents a bar with a clock and updated date; of course, missed calls and incoming messages including their number appear here too. The screen saver can be set to activate in 1 to 30 minutes. In addition, you can activate a power-save mode, in which the display goes out completely and the only indicator of the activity of the phone remains the tiny diode illuminated in blue. No new events get alerted in this mode. The diode winks in unchangeable intervals, which converts it into a mere decorative element.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Once up, once down<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Except for the above mentioned three buttons located on the side of the phone, all other keys are situated beneath the display. The phone has a joystick and it is the main navigating tool. It is more slippery than stiff. It is quite a pity that Nokia N73's designers did not use the solution they applied in Nokia E60, where they covered the head of the control element in rubber. Context keys as well as the earphones for call control beneath them are perfect. The context keys are spacey and look as if truly made of metal; press is exact, mechanic elaboration is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most attractive elements of Nokia N73 appears to be the glossy plastic frame around its keypad. Hidden in it you will find a key for access to the menu, an editing pencil, the cancel "C" button, and a pretty new key for all S60 models - the so called "multimedia" key. The latter first appeared on Nokia N70 and later on Nokia N80. A press-hold on it opens the respective pre-selected application. Or you can press it short and then use the four-way key to run one of the four applications assigned to each way (their distribution is schematically visualized on the display).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Keypad details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All four keys inside the glossy bar are very comfortable to use. What I am not going to praise is the numeric part of N73's keypad. Every time I need to write a message or type a new number, I wander whether Nokia designers had forgotten everything they were taught at school about ergonomics when they were working on Nokia N73. Why? Instead of differentiating keys (by cascade distribution for example) they have separated them by projections. It has been a week now since I started to test the phone and I am still not able to get used to its keys; I am making typing errors all the time. Besides, the numeric part of the keypad looks rather cheap as the plastic material used for its elaboration is not appropriate for such a high-class handset. To sum up, I recommend you to test Nokia N73's keypad before you decide to buy the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main block of keys</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keys backlighting is good. Everything works as it should: the green and red buttons glow in their typical colors; the area of the joystick is illuminated too. The rest of the keys are illuminated in deep blue. As we mentioned earlier, the memory card slot is also backlighted.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>More equipment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N73 uses the latest version of the OS Symbian 9.1 and the S60 3rd Edition user interface. This Symbian version is both more extensive and safer. On the other hand, nearly all programs, including the cheapest ones, compatible with it, require special certificates. In this new system one can update firmware by air, that is, through the use of mobile networks (not tested yet though). Nokia N73 also offers USB Mass Storage and a brilliant Web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most customers reacted quite negatively to the new interface applied together with the new OS, as it requires the installation of all applications all over again and most of all - their additional purchase. No program designed for older Symbian versions is compatible with the new version. What's worse, till very recently there were very few programs compatible with S60 3rd Edition. Even though nowadays the situation has changed for good significantly, some popular programs are still hard to find.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main display of the new Symbian</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main display features the favorite active stand-by display, in which 6 selected applications can be instantly run by the user. Visualized beneath its icons are all events of the day including the nearest oncoming one as well as the tasks that still need to be accomplished. Both the calendar and the task manager can be accessed by a single confirming press. When music is playing or the radio is on, the name of the running file also appears on the main display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music minimized in active stand-by display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As work with the active stand-by display requires the use of the joystick, the four ways of the latter can not be assigned other functions in a common manner. This is only possible using the special multimedia key located above the cancel key. For more details, have a look at the above presented video.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The main menu can be visualized either in the form of a classical 3 x 4 grid, that is 12 icons en bloc, or as a standard list of items. The menu is cyclical, alias it rolls on instead of stopping at one of the ends of the display. Some icons in Nokia N73 are organized in a way differing from the menu of Nokia N80, For example, the folder "My Own" has disappeared for good. Newly installed programs are directly stored in a sections called "Applications". Each item can be cut out and sent somewhere else; or renamed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>With the help of Carl<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As soon as we obtained Nokia N73 last week, we grabbed it together with the other two photo mobiles equipped with a 3 megapixel camera and auto focus - Samsung D900 and Sony Ericsson K800 - and immediately ran out to test them. The results were published without any comment from our side. So far more than 430 readers have posted their opinion on which one is better. It looks like a tie between Nokia N73 and Sony Ericsson K800, while Samsung D900 camera has significantly less fans. In this comparison Nokia N73 shows very good resolution and low noise levels. The colors are attractive, vivid, but not very realistic. You may or may not like this approach. The high contrast and saturation levels applied by Nokia help for the wow factor, but produce worse results if you have to edit the photos later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I am not going to discuss the pictures taken with Nokia N73 in details. It is obvious that they belong among the best. What I am interested in is the interface of the camera application, or in other words, the degree of its user-friendliness. Even though it is quite similar to the interface used in Nokia N80, the interface of the camera application in Nokia N73 has undergone several graphic changes and works a little bit faster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let's light it up one after another<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N73 takes photos in landscape mode, that is, like a standard digital camera. The cover of the camera tunes well with the overall design of the phone. In its bottom area you will see 10 bulky dots, whose function is to stop user's fingers when the cover is being removed. The movement of the cover itself is quite pleasant; two springs help it reach its final positions. The cover is active; its removal starts the photo camera applications, while its closure switches the camera off. Unfortunately, it went loose after mere few days of usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; The camera cover is quite nice but loose</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A splendid illumination of the side control keys welcomes you once you have removed the camera protection cover. They get lighted gradually in the direction of the removal. First to glow is the volume button (here serving as a zoom key), followed by the gallery button and the release button. The order of deactivation of side keys coincides with the direction of the closure of the camera protection. Cool!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Side buttons for camera control</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Once the cover has been removed, the elements get illuminated one after another</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, there is one detail that should not be left unmentioned: should you leave the lens cover open while you are not working with the phone, the camera application switches to a save mode. In a result all three control keys die out and will not come to life even if pressed constantly. To get back to normal use you need to restart the camera application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sliding camera cover reveals a lens of the famous label Carl Zeiss with an auto focus and a mechanical shutter (exceptional for a photo mobile). The optics used in Nokia N73 is Tessar with aperture F/2.8. The lens is accompanied by a diode flash with red-eye reduction.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Icons and joystick in harmony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>I am observing the display while taking photos: in the upper left corner is the symbol of the active mode: photo or video; in the left bottom corner is stated the number of the images still left to make in the currently selected resolution and the size of those already taken. The right (here top) context key closes the camera application, while the left (bottom) one takes you back to the default setup, where you can save your images into the image store or into albums, for example. I presume you will not happen to open this folder frequently though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Camera interface ? main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Selecting image size ? front VGA camera can be activated too</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All important functions are veiled behind the icons in the right area of the display. These are tiny but even so quite distinctive thanks to the QVGA resolution (240 x 320 pixels). The design of the legends describing each setting is quite nice. Icons' look changes in accordance with selected items; hence, it is not necessary to enter icons' menus repeatedly to check the levels of exposure compensation or the current color nuance, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hide the entire icon bar, it will pop out every time you move the joystick and then disappear once again behind the right end of the display. If you select and hold for a second on a particular icon, a short descriptive legend appears nearby - a function that is impossible to deactivate but, fortunately, it does not disturb photo process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wait for a while, a description of icon's functions will appear on the display</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you use zoom, the icons described above get replaced by a vertical indicator for zoom-in. Nokia N73 has a 20x digital zoom; any zoom higher than 16x works with cutouts only, it is marked red and is easy to detect. Further, you could deactivate the extensive zoom for good and "only" work with a 16x one in full resolution. Anyway, the digital zoom is just a marketing gimmick, if you really need zoom on your phone you should choose models with optical zoom - currently a very limited selection, Nokia N93 and a couple of Sharp models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoom indicator with a red area of the extended zoom</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let me now offer you an organized list of Nokia N73's camera setup options, which shows how rich camera's menu is:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera built in Nokia N73 also shoots video records in a resolution of 352 x 288 pixels, which are saved in MP4 format. Their duration is only limited by the free memory available in the phone. Regretfully, video records come out choppy. Zoom application is virtually useless. Audio can be both activated and deactivated. Following please find a sample of a video shot with Nokia N73. Believe me, however, that Nokia 6280 featuring no OS, for example, scores with its VGA resolution far better than the new king Nokia N73.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N73 is good at music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Music player has undergone no modifications. This is no bad news though as we have always considered it very good (see reviews of recent Nokia models). Music files can be visualized en bloc or grouped by artist, genre, by album, or by composer. Volume levels are sufficient; btw, the highest ones are so high that you will hardly ever come to use them. In any case, a pair of good earphones is a must. However, make sure to buy an adapter for a standard 3.5 mm jack, as there is no such on the cable with remote control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Player functions ? selecting a category ? updating music library</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player works even when minimized. The titles of the tracks running appear on the display. Volume is settable straight from the display. Incoming calls hush music down gradually; once a call is terminated, the track continues from the place it was interrupted. Ringtones can be heard in the earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   A list of all music files on the memory card ? playing a selected one ? equalizer ? player minimized in background</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earphones enclosed in the original package could also serve as a handsfree set. The remote control located on their cable contains a microphone and a clip that helps stick the cable to user's clothes, a volume swinging key, and a button for call acceptance or rejection (a long press on this button activates voice dialing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Original earphones with a remote control located on the cable</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio installed in Nokia N73 is of the Visual series, even though the visual part is usable in very few spots in the world. The FM frequencies can be typed manually, searched according to signal intensity, or gradually tuned by searching the entire frequency range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS is not available in result of which you will need to type the names of your favorite stations (maximum 20) manually. Broadcast is stereophonic, but may convert into monophonic if the signal intensity gets weaker. Bear in mind that the radio application is only functional when the earphones are plugged into the Pop-port, because their cable plays the role of an antenna.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apart of my own videos Nokia N73 managed also to play converted video files in 3GP and MP4 formats, both in full-screen mode. Use the joystick to search tracks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Calls and phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia N73 supports all four GSM bands - 900, 1800, 850, and 1900 MHz. In addition, it supports 3rd generation networks, which - together with the second camera located above the display - facilitate video calls, including instant data. Connection to UMTS is user-configurable from the menu - a useful option in case that energy should be saved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of Nokia N73's sound is rather standard, noise levels are insignificant. Unfortunately, its volume capacity is a bit limited; I need to stick the handset very close to my ear every time I am executing a call in a busy environment. The same holds true for the handsfree speaker. Incoming calls can be silenced; during calling you can also deactivate the microphone or start to record the call. To my and overall disgrace, however, Nokia continues to ignore customers' advice as to the length of its voice records (used for call records) - it is once again limited to a mere one minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Received, missed and dialed calls are stored in separate folders of the Log application. Each call record includes date and time. Calls executed to or from one and the same numbers only appear once accompanied by the date and the time of the last try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Straight from the Log you can make calls, write SMS to a particular number, and save this number into the phonebook. In addition, the Log is able to record the duration of the calls made and data transferred. This last function, however, cannot be run by a mere press on the green key in stand-by mode, but has to be activated from the main menu. The main menu also provides access to a detailed log, which holds information about all processes taken place in the phone, that is, individual and repeated calls, and data transfers. The Log can be filtered both by connection type and selected number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has seen no changes as to former models. All contacts use shared memory, so the phonebook can virtually contain an infinite number of both contacts and phone numbers. Along with first and last name (organized in separated fields), each contact can also be assigned a pile of other fields: company, position, nickname, additional fields, mobile numbers, land-line numbers, video call numbers, Internet numbers, fax numbers, pagers, Push-to-talk addresses, emails, Websites, notes, street addresses, birth date. Each contact can contain an unlimited amount of phone numbers (50 for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Phonebook ? searching by gradual typing ? contact details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Access to the phonebook is user-configurable. As usual, its icon is located on the first position in the active stand-by display, but it could also be assigned to a context key or to the multimedia key. Once you enter the phonebook, just type the initial of the searched contact - the phone will do the rest on its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All contacts from the phonebook can be voice dialed. Nokia N73 recognizes any voice, which automatically excludes prior teaching. It works smoothly. When you press the respective key and pronounce the name of the person you want to call, the phone visualizes its image, reads its name with an artificial voice and dials the default number assigned to it. Individual numbers in the phonebook can be represented by a shortcut key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Countless fields to attach to each contact name ? a contact accompanied by an image</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sound<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Each name from the phonebook can be accompanied by a custom ringtone and an image, which appears once in the phonebook and once as a tiny icon when call is executed. Contacts can also be organized into groups, which help filtering calls in ringing profiles. Each group can be assigned a separate ringtone (but not image).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Selecting a profile ? modifying the selected profile</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N73 has 5 standard profiles plus an additional one for work in offline mode. If you need more profiles, there is no problem to configure them on your own. Within each profile you can set up a special ringtone for calls, for video calls, for messages, and for email. Volume level, vibration, keypad sounds and filtering are defined here as well. When filtering is active, only calls from members of selected groups are alerted of by ringtones. Inside the Profiles application you will find a new function: when a call is coming in, after the first ringing and to your will, Nokia N73 can pronounce caller's name with its specific artificial voice. It is a pretty useful function, btw, as it frees you from having to look at the display when you are being called. The only condition here is that the respective caller is included in the phonebook of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N73 supports nearly all existing ringtone formats, used by common mobiles, with the basic ones being MIDI and 48-voice melodies (Nokia N70 was able to ring with 64 voices). Besides, Nokia N73 manages MP3, AAC, AMR, Real Audio, RealTones, TrueTones, and WAV. The phone's vibration is not of the most powerful one, but is strong enough to make you feel the device in your pocket; its sound is pleasantly moderate.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia N73 works in both GSM and 3G networks. It manages video calls successfully. Calling process alone has remained the same: once the contact or the number to dial has been selected simply select the option Video call from the context menu. Then you need to look at the front lens. Your image will appear in a tiny area on the display, while the rest of it will be occupied by the image of your video call partner. Instead of sending the opposite side a live image of yours, you could only show them a static picture.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>And what about messaging?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Compared to earlier Nokia models, the SMS application in Nokia N73 has been left untouched. The higher resolution used in the phone does not bring along the visualization of more lines en bloc than before, but at least makes each line to fit in more letters than before. Font legibility is good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia N73 is equipped with T9 dictionary. Sent messages are stores in the "Sent" folder. The number of sent and received messages the phone could archive only depends on the amount of available free memory. MMS are supported, of course. The profile for their sending is preset in the phone. The MMS editor is simple and well organized. Along with a text body a MMS could also contain an image, a sound, or a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Messaging folder ? creating SMS ? options to apply in MMS ? creating MMS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In order to set up an email box of your own you need to download its content from the respective server. Nokia N73's display shows 4 messages en bloc at most. Emails in HTML format get visualized without any problem. The email editor works with accounts using POP3 and IMAP4. Besides, you can predefine whether the phone should download the entire message content or previews only; the download of an entire message body requires an additional click. Attachments (documents, tables, images) are downloaded and visualized afterwards.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The fabulous browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It has been more than a month since me and all my colleagues fell in love with the new browser built in Nokia N73. It is just fantastic. It visualizes pages instantly (3G network is a must) and correctly. Image loading can be deactivated, but even so web pages come out as if real. Naturally, all this requires transferring of a huge amount of data, so make sure you have a flat data contract with your provider. Otherwise, together with browser's abilities you will also have to admire your month bill.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The main cursor is controlled through the joystick, it is a tiny pointer. Controls are pretty similar to those of communicators: use the pointer to click on preferred item; to scroll the page move the pointer towards the margins of the selected direction. If you continue to scroll, a mini-map showing your position within the current page comes out - a very important function for overall orientation. Even though the browser is brilliant, it has one significant disadvantage: its image cannot be displayed in landscape mode. Nokia N73 does not support landscape images even though the browser application itself contains this option (check the same browser built in Nokia E60).</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The organizer functions were good enough even at the older Symbian mobiles. Their base is the calendar, which content could be displayed in active stand-by mode, too. The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view. When in the monthly view you come upon a day with a note, it is displayed in a bubble.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Calendar: monthly view ?&nbsp;weekly ?&nbsp;details of a selected day </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tasks (To-do notes) are now a component of the calendar, they were separated before. Personally, I think that this is more-practical - in one day preview I can see all my tasks and meetings gathered. The tasks may be ordered by the due date note or priority. Maybe it's a good idea to add the alarms and notes to the calendar too? I would award a Gold Raspberry to Nokia for its smartphones alarm function - such a long negligence of the repetitive function is shameful. In addition to this, there is no stopwatch again - it has to be installed separately.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>One of the preset programs in Nokia N73 is QuickOffice - a browser designed to read Microsoft Office formats. Quickword opens text documents DOC, Quicksheet reads tables in Excel, while Quickpoint visualizes PowerPoint presentations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the phone you will also find an Infrared port, which seems to be reviving in Nokia smartphones after years of oblivion. It is supplemented by an entire scale of data transfer capabilities: from Bluetooth or USB (phone's battery cannot be charged straight from a PC) to GPRS, EDGE, and UMTS networks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you see Nokia N73 like a mobile tool for work, then you will probably not show any interest in the Carl Zeiss logo placed on the camera lens on the rear cover of the phone. Nevertheless, you will certainly appreciate the possibility to take pictures of documents and tables, read their electronic images in QuickOffice or check and manage your email box. All time organizing applications in Nokia N73, except the alarm clock, are brilliantly elaborated. The phonebook offers a virtually unlimited space plus plenty of fields for each contact, and an exceptional Web browser. Synchronization is seamless. Satisfied?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should be. But I know and expect your response: "Where's Wi-Fi?"... Well, nowhere...The absence of Wi-Fi damns the phone... gives it a black point...and may easily be a decisive matter at the moment of purchase.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If - on the contrary - Nokia N73 is more of a "multimedia computer" for you, you will be fascinated by its camera abilities. The phone makes some of the best photos a mobile phone has ever been able to make; macro is superb, flash is powerful. Nokia N73 does not lack a music player (an additional memory card to be bought separately is a must), nor earphones (adapter required). It plays movies and manages video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, if you need a work phone during the day and a multimedia device at night, then Nokia N73 is ideal for you.</paragraph>
