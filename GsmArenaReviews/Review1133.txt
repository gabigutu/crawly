		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola achieved the unthinkable with the RAZR MAXX. A 9mm body, which is slim even by today's modern standards, fits a battery that dwarfs all others. With the CDMA version our all-time battery backup champion, it's now time to see how the GSM holds its juice and Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Steamrolled to the staggering 7.1mm, the Motorola RAZR XT910 still managed to pack in a 1780mAh battery. Nothing short of impressive, but the RAZR MAXX almost doubles the battery capacity to 3,300 mAh and it's still only 9mm thin. For comparison's sake, an HTC One X has an 1800mAh battery, a Samsung Galaxy S III goes up to 2100mAh and even the LG Optimus 4X HD only manages 2150mAh. And those phones have four hungry CPU cores to feed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX is more than just a big battery glued to a screen though. While its specs are no longer flagship-worthy specs, there's still plenty of oomph in the 1.2GHz dual-core CPU, the 8MP camera shoots 1080p footage and the 4.3 qHD Super AMOLED display sounds pretty sweet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a list of the key specs on the RAZR MAXX along with a few things we didn't like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you like accessories that extend the phone's capabilities, you'll appreciate the Motorola RAZR MAXX. It supports Moto's webtop functionality through a selection of docks that enable PC-like features. There's even one that turns the phone into a full-fledged 14" Android-running netbook ala Asus Padfone (full-size keyboard, Firefox browser, and such).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR MAXX is also a bit of a tough guy - the screen has the traditional Gorilla Glass protection, while the back is made of Kevlar. Not to menation that the phone is splash-resistant too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressively built and carrying an extra fuel tank, the RAZR MAXX is ready to hit our test track. And for once we're more interested in how long it lasts than how fast it goes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Motorola RAZR MAXX retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX comes in a standard box that contains all the essentials: a compact charger that uses the microUSB cable, a single-piece headset with no extra earbuds and the usual user guides. The earphones are different than the ones that came with the RAZR XT910.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the microSD card slot is empty (Verizon throws in a 16GB card), the phone features 16GB of built-in storage (double the Verizon model).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Motorola RAZR MAXX 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR measures 130.7 x 68.9 x 9 mm - only 1.9mm thicker than a regular RAZR, but with almost double the battery capacity. It weighs 145g, 17g heavier than the XT910 model.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX is built using the same blueprints as the RAZR XT910, except for a slight adjustment in the thickness. The design is distinctive and stands apart from the Samsungs and HTCs, which earns scores for personality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of the all too common rounded rectangle design, the RAZR MAXX is beveled at the corners and the piece of Gorilla Glass is somewhat of a hexagon. The Kevlar back is even more recognizable and brings carbon-fiber-like aesthetics to the phone (many luxury items, including high-end cars, have a carbon fiber option).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, it's not easy to tell apart from the non-MAXX model, which is an advantage of sorts - people who got the XT910 will be a little disappointed they didn't spring some extra cash when you tell them how often you recharge your RAZR MAXX.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find proximity and ambient light sensors along with the 1.3MP secondary camera. A notification light will blink blue in case of missed events. The earpiece is also here, below the Motorola logo, finely etched in a metal plate that proudly stands out against its black surroundings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the display are the traditional four capacitive keys in charge of Android navigation - Menu, Home, Back and Search - and the mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Motorola RAZR is where the three wired connectivity ports are lined up within a nice strip of rubberized plastic. The 3.5mm audio jack, a microUSB port and the microHDMI are all uncovered and risk getting filled with dust over time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset is very tidy, only featuring the microSIM and microSD card slots hidden under a shared plastic lid. The memory card is very easy to put in and pull out while the SIM card is near impossible to eject after it's been inserted. We had the same issue with the regular RAZR when we reviewed it, but we weren't certain if it's a design flaw or an issue with our unit. Having the same issue now leads us to believe it's just poor design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Motorola RAZR features the big Power/Lock key and the volume rocker. The Power/Lock key has a different finish than the volume rocker, so they're easy to tell apart by touch. The volume keys are small and not very comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Motorola RAZR is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back on the other hand is rather interesting. The phone is a single solid piece - there's no battery cover. The Kevlar rear has a distinctive pattern (it looks kind of like carbon fiber) and a nice, rubbery feel to it, which improves grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top part of the back protrudes slightly to accommodate the 8MP camera, the LED flash and the loudspeaker, but it's not as prominent as on the anorexic RAZR XT910, which actually improves the phone's feel in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also on the back is the noise-cancellation microphone placed right opposite the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery isn't user replaceable but we don't think you'd ever need to carry a spare with the RAZR MAXX, so it's not an issue. The capacity of 3,300mAh is an unmatched feat in mobile phones, let alone at a sub-centimeter thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Officially, the phone is rated at 607 hours of standby and 17 hours 40 minutes of talk time. We're running our own battery tests, but those will take a while to do properly (draining that huge battery is not an easy task). We'll make the numbers available here as soon as we have them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update, August 28: We're finally done testing the battery and you're about to find out why it took us so long. The Motorola RAZR MAXX with Android ICS shot past the results of the CDMA-packing DROID RAZR MAXX, scoring an endurance rating of 87 hours - the phone can last for days, even with heavy usage. The RAZR MAXX can last almost an entire day in 3G calling, 9 full hours of web browsing or over 16 hours of playing videos. Other don't even come close to these numbers. You can learn more about our testing procedure over here and the full battery test write-up over here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR uses a Super AMOLED screen that measures 4.3" in diagonal and dominates the front. We've seen the display in many other phones and it's perfectly fine although perfectionists will scoff at it - the 256ppi pixel density is about average and the PenTile matrix suffers a visible cross-hatch pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen offers deep blacks and great contrast the way only an AMOLED can and excellent viewing angles - there's no color or contrast loss at all. It's not very bright but the sunlight legibility is still quite good. In the end, it's a very solid display even if it cannot match the sharpness of current 720p screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more information on our display test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We zoomed into the display using our digital microscope so you can get a better idea of how the pixels are arranged, and how big they are. What we saw was what we expected - a PenTile matrix with big red and blue diodes and small green diodes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The Motorola RAZR MAXX under a microscope</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorla RAZR MAXX is reasonably pocketable and, we dare say, more comfortable to hold than the thin and top heavy RAZR XT910, which did feel a little awkward in the hand. We still maintain that the phone is a bit too tall and wide for its 4.3" screen, but unless your pockets are extra small it shouldn't be an issue (actually, given the choice we would have the RAZR MAXX stay the same size but with a slightly bigger display, say 4.5").</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do appreciate how durable the phone feels - the body is very solid (it helps that there are no detachable parts) and even cosmetic damage seems unlikely with that Kevlar coating on the back. The phone is splash resistant, which reduces the chances of water damage, but you still need to take care of the exposed ports at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So far, the Motorola RAZR MAXX feels familiar, but has enough personality to keep our interest. It's likely to stay like that in the software section of the review, as the Moto-skinned Ice Cream Sandwich OS looks quite similar to the skinned Gingerbread that we experienced on the XT910.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ICS update brings revamped custom UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX launched with Gingerbread, but has since moved on to Ice Cream Sandwich. The update brought more than just a change of the underlying OS -Moto's customizations have been refined too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we go on, here's the user interface in action to give you an idea of what we're dealing with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is inspired by the current trend in Android lockscreens - providing shortcuts to commonly used features. It uses a familiar "drag out of a circle" action to launch the dialer, the messaging app, the camera or simply unlock the phone. Instead of dragging, you can just tap the key icon and tap the icon of the app you want. A ringer toggle is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen can be further customized with a couple of other options - Face Unlock, of course, but also the more standard PIN, pattern and password unlocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen consists of five side-scrollable panes. A tap on the Home key brings you to the middle pane, but oddly the preview mode that showed a zoomed out view of all five homescreens is gone. This means you can no longer easily rearrange homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX comes with a long list of custom widgets to place around the homescreen. Some widgets can be resized, all you need to do is tap and hold on a widget. Resizing also changes the widget's appearance - depending on the widget, it can display more or less info when resized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is pulled down from the top, as usual. It's a clean, unaltered notification area - no quick toggle buttons or anything like that in here. You still get the swipe to dismiss function that ICS brought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen there is dock with five shortcuts - the center one always brings up the app drawer, but the other four you are free to replace with whatever app you want (even a bookmark or a playlist).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can create folders in the familiar ICS way. All you have to do is swipe the icon over the one you want to pair it with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a final extra shortcut, you can also set up the Home key to launch an app on double tap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the app drawer, it looks like the standard ICS launcher, but Moto has tweaked it a bit. Each page is a 4 x 5 grid of icons. The option to change the sorting order of the icons is no longer available (another feature missing since the transition to ICS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What Moto kept in place was the Groups feature - the default ones are All apps, Frequent and Downloaded. You can create custom groups (and assign them custom icons). So, you can have groups labeled Work, Games and so on, which really helps get things in order if you have many apps installed. Later you can put those groups as shortcuts on the homescreen or even in the dock at the bottom to create an alternative app drawer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new ICS task switcher has taken over from the custom switcher (called "Recent") and the task manager that Motorola used on Gingerbread. The ICS interface is more intuitive and easier to use, so it's a welcome change.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX uses relatively old hardware - the TI OMAP 4430 chipset with a 1.2GHz dual-core Cortex-A9 processor, PowerVR SGX540 GPU and 1GB of RAM was all the rage last year, but is now little better than mid-range. Still, it has plenty of fight left in it, especially after a refreshing serving of Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the processor is no Krait, it got excellent scores in Benchmark Pi, though Linpack scores are a bit below other dual-cores. The AnTuTu score is around half of what the current quad-core flagships achieved, which is all that we could have asked from the RAZR MAXX.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>

			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the 3D benchmarks, the PowerVR SGX540 manages to win out against single-core Mali-400 GPUs (like in the popular NovaThor U8500 chipset that recent mid-range dual-core droids employ), and that's with a qHD screen whereas most of the competition uses WVGA or less.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The ICS web browser gets a big bump in performance compared to the Gingerbread one. With the update, the Motorola RAZR MAXX successfully rivals an iPhone 4S in both JavaScript performance and HTML5.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has Gtalk integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contacts are part of the Phone app and the layout is pretty standard - you get a list of all contacts sorted alphabetically with an alphabet scroll to quickly jump to a specific letter. Quick contacts are available too for easy access to some features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be synced with multiple services, including Google's own, as well as Exchange accounts, Facebook and Twitter among others. Viewing a single contact is pretty standard too, except you can swipe left to view recent Gtalk messages. Unfortunately, nothing else goes in here - no recent calls, texts, no social networking updates, nothing but Gtalk, which really limits its use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you've connected your phone to a social networking account, you'll get links to the contact's profile in those networks under the Connections heading. That's all it does though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add new contact details besides the preset ones. There's no limit to the fields you can add to a contact. You can also link contacts, which aggregates information from multiple services into a single, combined entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also star contacts so they go into the Favorites tab - which is a two-column grid of large thumbnails of the contact's photos. Those contacts are shown in the Phonebook tab in the dialer in the same format, with the regular phonebook below them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has Smart dialing, smart tricks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX didn't have any reception issues and the sound was loud and clear on both ends of calls. The RAZR MAXX features a secondary microphone to suppress ambient noise during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon an incoming call, you get a similar interface to that of the lockscreen. You can accept or reject a call, including rejecting a call with an SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is enabled on the MAXX. It shows only one matching contact at a time - you can use the down arrow to reveal alternative suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice commands are here too (a custom Motorola job), available through a handy shortcut in the dialer. You can use them to dial, send a message, play a song and a few other options. A press and hold on the Search key will bring up the default Android voice command feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log integrates into the dialer and has a couple of clever tricks. First off, each call entry has several arrows next to it - green for outgoing calls, blue for incoming and red for missed. Calls to/from a single contact are grouped and the arrows show the sequence of calls with that contact. The other trick is to press and hold on a cal log entry and choose "Add to tasks". That puts down a reminder in the Tasks app, e.g. "Call Dexter".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool thing you can do is make the phone read out the caller ID for an incoming call, assign custom ringtones to contacts or even enable a reject call option. There's also an option for hearing aid compatible devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Motorola RAZR MAXX. The handset rated as Good and its vibration was quite strong too. The loudspeaker is a little quieter than what the RAZR XT910 has, but you shouldn't have issues hearing it in all but the loudest environments. More info on our loudspeaker test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-in-one Messaging app is gone, garden variety instead<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Motorola used to have a really awesome app called Messaging that combined every conceivable form of messaging - texting, email, IM and social networking solutions. It's gone now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you do get is the Messages app, which is pretty much your ordinary Android SMS and MMS department - threaded messaging is enabled and the message composer has a neat and simple interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can easily be added to the Tasks app to serve as reminders and they can be locked to prevent accidental deletion. There's an option to enable delivery reports and you can limit the number of messages in a conversation (200 by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tap-to-compose box starts off as a single line but it will expand as you go, up to eight lines. You also get a quick character counter (and message part counter) as you type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to actions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is pretty simple - you just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gmail and generic email clients<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For email there are the Gmail app and a generic email app. In Gmail, batch operations are supported and allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. You can enable push email or schedule automatic updates. There's an option to only sync over Wi-Fi, which is sure to save you data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A combined inbox for any email service provider is available in the generic email app called simply Email. Batch operations are supported here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To help you navigate your busy inbox there's conversation view and also emails can be sorted by date, sender, importance and status (read/unread), attachment or flagged. The app shows a preview for each email consisting of two, three or four lines (you can set that in the options).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It supports simple gesture actions too - you can set an action for left-to-right and right-to-left swipes on emails in the list. Available actions are mark as read/unread, move or delete.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice feature is the Dark theme, which is enabled by default. It uses a black background to minimize energy consumption on the AMOLED screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For text input on the Motorola RAZR MAXX you get two options - the Swype keyboard (enabled by default) or the standard Motorola QWERTY keyboard. There's handwriting recognition, which is useful for entering Chinese characters. Typing is pretty comfortable as the keyboard is multitouch capable and the big screen helps too. You can go to landscape mode if you want it even bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have a Bluetooth or a USB keyboard hooked up, you can enable the US International keyboard layout (but other layouts are not available). If there's a mouse or a trackpad, the pointer speed can be adjusted. These are all helpful settings if you have a dock and use your RAZR MAXX as a PC replacement.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Highly customized gallery with unacceptable lag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app is custom-made and looks pretty cool. When you start it up, it uses a virtual pile of your photos for a background. Unfortunately, tapping them does nothing - you have to go into the Camera roll, My library, Online, Friends or MotoCast sub-galleries to access your photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, once you go into a sub-gallery, things start to look up. Browsing local galleries is much like the standard experience with pictures stacked into albums. You can change that view to Timeline (view photos a day, a week or a month old), Albums, Locations, Tags or Folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone landscape launches a Cover Flow-like 3D landscape mode, with cool looking shadow effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Online and Friends sub-galleries handle online photo albums for you and your friends - Picasa, Facebook, Flickr and Photobucket are supported. MotoCast syncs photos between your phone and your computer, so you don't have to worry if you copied some photos to the phone or not - as long as your computer is running, you have access to them. The downside of this approach stems from just that - unlike cloud services, you need to keep your PC on for MotoCast to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that disappointed us in previous Moto models was zooming - and they haven't fixed it for the ICS update either. Pinch-zooming is very choppy, unbecoming for a phone with a reasonably powerful chipset, and double tap zooms in and out without any animation. At least panning is smooth, but this is not acceptable for what should have been mature software by now. Hopefully, Google will crack a few whips and get things done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing photos through the RAZR MAXX gallery is fairly easy and can be done over Bluetooth, Email, Text messaging and any of the photo-sharing services you have signed up for. You can also set up one of those accounts for Quick upload. The Quick upload option uploads the selected photo to the selected service with a single tap but unfortunately doesn't work with multiple images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery has the standard ICS photo editing features. You can add light enhancements (e.g. fill light, highlights, shadows and so on), effects, color tones (warmth, saturation, B&amp;W, etc.), along with cropping, straightening, red eye correction and a few others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player handles 1080p, audio a problem<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the Motorola RAZR MAXX is pretty basic - you access the videos through the standard Gallery or Files apps. In the Gallery, it offers the same UI as the gallery and the same 3D landscape view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is there's pretty good support for multiple video codecs: out of the various DivX, XviD, MP4, X264 files we tried only one refused to play. Videos played smoothly and looked great on the qHD SuperAMOLED screen, and we even had no issues with the 1080p clips. This is where the microHDMI port becomes very useful as the Motorola RAZR MAXX can take over as a video player for your HDTV - with some limitations though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options in the video player are limited to forward and backward scrubbing and viewing the video in its original resolution (only if it's lower than the screen resolution). No brightness settings, subtitles or anything more advanced than simply playing the video is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the biggest issue we found with the player wasn't video codec support - the audio codecs were the ones causing problems. Videos that used AC3 and DTS (the most common audio codecs for HD videos in MKV format) wouldn't play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, a third party player from the market can solve the issue of missing features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with tons of settings and info<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX running ICS comes with a custom music player that looks a lot like the gallery. It offers several different music sources - My library (with MotoCast integration), Internet radio and DLNA servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get into the My library, you are presented with an interface that works a lot like the phonebook - complete with a feature that's a lot like quick contacts. You can view your tracks grouped by artist, album, genre, view all songs or use playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One cool feature that can be accessed from the quick shortcuts is the info screen, which shows you artist bio, related events, photos, music videos, discography and an option to browse similar artists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, when you get into the Now playing interface you can see the album art (with a shortcut for the artist info screen) and you have shortcuts to share the song you're listening to on a social network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a wide array of audio settings available - both for headphones and loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For headphones you get 3D stereo, Home theater, Live Stage or Custom, which includes yet more things like Extreme Bass, Bass punch, Balanced, Brilliant Treble and Vocalizer but no actual custom equalizer settings. You can switch the equalizer off too if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For playing music on the loudspeaker, you only get the Custom equalizer settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player would also automatically fetch lyrics for the currently playing song and display them karaoke style. You can also tap on the two-line lyrics autocue to view the lyrics for the whole song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has extensive DLNA options. You can choose to continue playing a track on another DLNA device, copy it to a DLNA server, share the phone's music library over DLNA and there are even options to let other devices upload songs to the phone or enable Xbox support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As expected, the Motorola RAZR MAXX did really well in our audio quality test. Just like its RAZR XT910 sibling it got excellent scores all over the field and impressed with its high volume levels in the first part of our test. Indeed, when connected to an active external amplifier, the RAZR MAXX is among the best performers we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things are as impressive when you plug in a pair of headphones, but the RAZR MAXX still remains a competent performer. Stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortion took the biggest hits, while volume levels went from great to good. Frequency response also worsened a bit, but still remained decent.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX is equipped with an 8MP camera that shoots photos with a maximum resolution of 3264x2448 pixels. It's got a single-LED flash to assist in low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is very basic. On the right side of the viewfinder there's the virtual shutter key flanked by the front/rear and still/video toggles. On the left, there's the gallery shortcut that displays the thumbnail of the last photo taken and the digital zoom slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a retractable row of shortcuts at the bottom - those include effects, scenes, shooting mode, exposure adjustment and flash control (on, off, auto).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From Modes, you can choose single shot, multi-shot (4MP photos), panorama or self timer. Scenes offer things like Sport, Macro or an Auto mode that decides what's best without your explicit input. There's an option to geotag photos - that info can be stripped automatically when sharing photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MotoCast can be set to automatically upload photos you take to a computer. You can set this to happen with some delay (1 or 5 mintues), only over Wi-Fi and only while charging. This way, you can make the RAZR MAXX automatically upload the photos you took that day to your computer when you get home, without worrying about data charges or running down the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widescreen option is enabled by default - it trims photos down to 16:9 aspect ratio so they fit the qHD screen and HDTVs perfectly at the cost of resolution (2MP are lost in the process).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR MAXX supports touch focus and there's an option to set the volume rocker to serve as a shutter key. There's no half-press available with this option though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX produces fairly crisp photos, but quite grainy too. There's no color noise, but the noise reduction smears out some of the fine detail. Exposure, contrast and colors are all good..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the RAZR MAXX has a good 8MP camera, though the narrow field of view was a bit of a disappointment.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can check out the Motorola RAZR MAXX over at our photo quality compare tool. Just click on one of the images to check out the full page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high-contrast of the first chart are rendered fairly crisp, but there are signs of oversharpening. Trying to take a photo of this chart revealed something else too - the viewfinder crops the edges of the image. It shouldn't matter to most users, but it can be annoying if you're trying to frame your scene just right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the second chart you can see that the gravel and grass patches are smeared a bit by noise reduction but not too badly. The third chart shows that white balance under artificial lighting is accurate.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Improved camcorder with FullHD video capture<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX shoots 1080p videos at 30fps. The user interface looks similar to that of the still camera although some options have been changed. The Scenes option from the still camera has been replaced by Audio Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have Stereo, Wind Reduction, Concert, Balanced and Front Facing audio presets, which use the two microphones to adapt the audio to the specific situation. You still have the effects and exposure options and you can enable video stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera lacks touch focus, but it does have continuous autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has also grown the ability to snap 3MP photos with 16:9 aspect ratio during video recording. We're not sure why Moto didn't go for 6MP shots, which is the max camera resolution in 16:9 mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are stored in .MP4 files with bitrate hovering at just over 15Mbps. The sound that goes along with the video is stereo (128Kbps bitrate, 44.1kHz sampling rate). Videos are smooth in terms of framerate and are sharp with plenty of detail, though a bit grainy. Contrast and colors are okay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the still camera, the video camera has a fairly limited field of view. The autofocus triggered a bit too often for our liking too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget to choose 1080p and view the videos in full screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's an untouched 1080p@30fps video (0:09s, 18.2MB), straight from the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality compare tool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Check out the Motorola RAZR MAXX in our video compare tool. You can pit it against other phones in this class to get an idea of where it stands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third chart shows a big improvement in resolution over the RAZR XT910, which we tested with Gingerbread. There is quite a good deal of sharpening going on though, which creates some artifacts. Our Ferris wheel shows that videos do indeed have good resolution (you can see detail in the faux sky background, which not many phones manage), but there are a few spots where compression impacted the fine detail somewhat. There's also a noticeable yellowish tint (the setup is shot under artificial lighting), which wasn't there in still shots. Low-light shooting is RAZR MAXX's forte.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity has almost everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX comes with a rich connectivity set. It offers quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band HSDPA potentially reaching speeds of up to 14.4 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity features include Wi-Fi b/g/n (with DLNA support) and Bluetooth 4.0 with LE. The mobile hotspot functionality is enabled on the RAZR MAXX too. Wi-Fi hotspot functionality is available, but the phone can also share its Internet connection over USB or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for wired connectivity, there's a microUSB port and a microHDMI port. Using an appropriate HDMI cable (not included in the retail box), you can hook up the MAXX to an HDTV. The microHDMI port also comes into play with the docks, but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX comes with a MotoPrint app that serves easy printer connections over the local Wi-Fi network for printing all sorts of Office docs, PDFs, emails, photos, calendar entries and contact info. All you have to do is find the printer (there is an automatic search, manual search, search in the homegroup among other options).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola have included an extra application - MotoCast. It allows you to access files stored on your computer (you can choose which folders) over the Internet. That means that everywhere you have a data connection, you can grab a file from your computer. It also allows you to access the files through any web browser by navigating it to MyMotoCast.com. That's a good app for the forgetful type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another pre-installed app is Citrix Receiver. It's a desktop virtualization app - basically, it gives you access to full blown virtual PC running Windows and you can launch the desktop versions of Word, Excel and various other apps. Receiver also helps you keep your documents synced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Citrix Receiver is the kind of thing that will really help road warriors who have one of the docks (more on it below) - if your company's IT department sets up things nicely, you can hook up your RAZR MAXX to a monitor, keyboard and mouse (or use the lapdock) and get a full desktop experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Citrix Receiver is free at the market, but the virtual PC service is paid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another preinstalled tool for business people on the go is the GoToMeeting app - it enables web conferencing, with video chat with up to 25 people with whom you can share your screen and presentations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Lapdock and HD dock options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Several Motorola phones can be hooked up to Moto's advanced docks and the RAZR MAXX is one of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lapdock 500 Pro turns the RAZR into a 14" Android running netbook with a full-size QWERTY keyboard and a big touchpad. It features a video call camera above the screen, an Ethernet port (you read that right), a VGA port to connect to projectors, two USB host ports and an SD card slot (that's SD, not microSD).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's not all - the Webtop app provides an interface much better suited to the laptop form-factor than the standard Android UI. It uses windows to make it more familiar, an app shortcut dock at the bottom (a lot like a Mac) and a desktop-grade Firefox browser (not the mobile version).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two more docks - the HD Station and the HD Dock. They both charge your phone, let you conveniently connect external speakers, pair with your HDTV (or monitor with a HDMI port) and use the desktop Firefox app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference is that the HD Station also features 3 USB ports, which you can use to hook up a keyboard,mouse and external storage too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>ICS browser in the post-Flash era<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX gets to enjoy the excellent ICS browser after the update. This browser has a streamlined interface, incognito browsing and other cool features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser chrome is quite minimalistic; all you get is the URL bar with a tabs shortcut. Hitting the Menu key makes more options available: Refresh, Forward, Save to bookmarks, Share page, Find on page, full settings and a couple of more - Request desktop site (no more hunting for that "Desktop" option buried at the bottom of the site) and Save for offline reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search engine to Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser borrows several features from its desktop counterpart. For example, when searching for something, if the browser is confident you'll click on a certain search result, it will start preloading that page right away so that it opens faster if you do click it. You can set this feature to work over Wi-Fi only to save on data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other trick is Incognito mode - there's no global setting, but you can open Incognito tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, the tab switching interface looks exactly like the Recent apps list. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls (available from the Labs settings) reveal five controls (New tab, Tabs, URL, Bookmarks, More) when you slide your finger in from the side. Those really improve the browser experience. Another cool feature from Labs is Full screen, which squeezes out a little more screen real estate by hiding the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer pre-installed and you can't get it from the Play Store either. It will work if you find the APK and install it, but many sites have gone the HTML5 way so there's less and less reason to install Flash. You might still need it though, for sites that still use Flash navigation and if you're a fan of touch-based Flash games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>YouTube automatically switches to HTML5 video and the Motorola RAZR MAXX could play 1080p video smoothly. YouTube's interface was a little buggy though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full organizer suite with Office document editing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like most of its droid siblings, the Motorola RAZR MAXX comes with a rich set of organizer features and Moto even threw in a version of Quickoffice that can edit documents too (on many phones, this is a paid upgrade).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice is an excellent app that has support for viewing several file types - Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF. It can also edit and create new .DOC, .XLS and .PPT files (2003, 2007 and 2010 versions are supported). You have plenty of formatting options, inserting images, Excel formulas and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The printing functionality enabled by MotoPrint is integrated into Quickoffice, which brings the document handling experience quite close to desktop standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. You can use the phone calendars or one of your online calendars to schedule events. You can also set multiple alarms to act as a reminder. The calendar integrates with the status bar and also offers pop-up notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR MAXX features a standard-looking Alarms &amp; timer app. You can set multiple alarms with different repeat times and alarm tones. The app does have an extra over the stock Clock app - a second tab with a timer. There's no stopwatch though. The old app offered cool custom watch faces here, but this one doesn't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a file manager on board as well - it can browse both the internal 16GB of memory and the microSD card. Batch actions are supported and you can ZIP (with or without encryption) and unzip archived files. It's a bit annoying that you can't browse an archive, just unzip it. Anyway, there's support for browsing shared folders on the Wi-Fi network you're connected to and also explore computers running MotoCast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Evernote also comes preinstalled - a popular note taking tool that synchronizes your notes across various platforms. The app is free at the Android Play Store, but adding it shows just how much the Motorola RAZR MAXX is targeted at business users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's a really clever app called Smart Actions. It lets you create automatic actions triggered by different conditions you set. You can have the phone do various things (e.g. disable background sync, change screen brightness, display a notification to remind you of something, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several sample actions that can be useful in certain scenarios but you can create your own from scratch too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not quite like having NFC, which lets you automate such things with tags. This could be a bit more flexible at times but isn't a replacement for NFC, which has other functions too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Offline Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute and a half to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will do if you only need a rough idea of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline from the menu" and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to fit New York and some surrounding area before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can plan routes, search for nearby POIs and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Play Store on ICS level<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now that the Motorola RAZR MAXX is running Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, it has access to the latest apps (like Chrome) and, with nearly 4GB worth of install space, you can download all the apps you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Google Play Store and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We're at the end of this review and we're quite happy with how it all went. The Motorola RAZR MAXX may use older hardware, but we didn't find it lacking severely in any respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the phone is top notch, with distinctive design and cool materials (kudos to Moto for using Kevlar on more and more phones recently). The screen holds up very well (it's the same unit to find on a modern upper-midrange phone like the HTC One S) and the camera is one of the better 8MP shooters. If the phone was a little more compact (or packed a larger screen on the same body) it would have been great, but that's not by any means a deal breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software is where the phone stumbles a bit - Motorola has a few helpful contributions to Ice Cream Sandwich and there's a great business software package out of the box but we would've appreciated deeper SNS integration and the choppy gallery is a bit hard to swallow. Desktop software gets some deserved criticism too - it's slow, has annoying pushy dialogs and would often fail to detect the phone properly. It's best to go without it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's dig around the Android catalog and see if we can find a suitable opponent for the Motorola RAZR MAXX - besides the regular RAZR XT910, that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One S is super slim - it even rivals the RAZR XT910 - and comes with cool finish too (anodized aluminum or aluminum with ceramic coating). It's got a more powerful dual-core CPU, which did fairly well in our battery tests, unless you're planning to browse the web a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola RAZR XT910 &#x2022; HTC One S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAZR MAXX and One S might be a bit too much to bear for some people's wallets, but fret not, there are more affordable options. The Huawei Ascend P1 uses pretty much the same hardware as the RAZR MAXX. It did well in our battery tests (though it too found web browsing quite taxing), but it's still quite a bit behind the RAZR MAXX.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Samsung I8530 Galaxy Beam is chubby in comparison - 12.5mm - and sits at a lower rung of the dual-core droid ladder, but the 2000mAh battery lasted fairly long (again, not as much as a RAZR MAXX) and those who watch lost of videos might find the built-in projector indispensible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, a Samsung Galaxy S II would offer you good performance and battery life as well and now that the former flagship has fallen to midrange prices it might be able to steal a few customers from the likes of the RAZR MAXX.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Huawei Ascend P1 &#x2022; Samsung I8530 Galaxy Beam &#x2022; Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, the Motorola RAZR MAXX is and will be the battery life king for at least a while. So, for people who absolutely must have a working phone on them, there aren't any real alternatives. At least, not unless they carry a spare battery or get one of those huge aftermarket packs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX is a phone that gets the work done - a lot of it. The RAZR MAXX can play too - it will keep you entertained with hours of video and hours of web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The energy efficiency of various mobile phone components keeps improving, but there's just no substitute for a huge battery like we have here. And it's Motorola's greatest achievement that it managed to integrate such juice pack without compromising size or style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola RAZR MAXX looks like the right phone for people with busy, always on the go lifestyle, who are looking to finally get rid of that ugly but reliable dumbphone or don't want to worry anymore about finding a power socket to top off their battery before the next leg of their journey.</paragraph>
