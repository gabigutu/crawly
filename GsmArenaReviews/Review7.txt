			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Dual-SIM smartphones are hard to get by. The Gigabyte GSmart S1205 is a fresh addition to that scarce product line, but doesn?t take its unique selling point as a license to empty your wallet. A well built phone, the GSmart is sturdy as a work horse ? and probably as good looking. But that?s not the point ? at this price you won?t look it in the mouth. It?s a straight deal: a dual SIM PocketPC within budget. The home-brewed Smart Pack user interface on top of the Windows Mobile 6.5 is the only bonus feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GSmart S1205 hits the market a few months before the release of the new Windows Phone 7 OS and must fight among a slew of Android handsets. But it has one powerful weapon ? dual-SIM dual standby support. We are sure there are many people out there who have to lug around both their home and work phones and would welcome a one-device solution. Their choice has always been limited and Gigabyte are pleased to offer a solution. The GSmart S1205 seems to have a whole niche all to itself. Let?s look at how it?s gonna handle it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of 3G support is perhaps the most important drawback. Still, there is EDGE to cover data connections and Wi-Fi for heavy use, which should be enough for most. The three megapixel fixed-focus camera is perhaps more of a disadvantage rather than a key feature. But dual-SIM smartphone shoppers are not quite likely to care about imaging anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gigabyte have made their own custom interface ? the Smart Pack UI. It adds some fancy homescreens to offset the rather boring Windows Mobile looks. The new UI is not in the same league as the heavily customized HTC Sense, but still manages to impress. We are not talking a high-end smartphone here after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let?s cut the foreplay. Follow us on the next page to see what the GSmart S1205 is made of.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tiny box of the Gigabyte GSmart S1205 packs everything you?d expect to get with such a phone. There?s a USB charger, a standard microUSB data cable and the usual paperwork.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a one-piece headset, but the supplied headphones aren't your only option as the S1205 has a 3.5mm audio jack. However, there is no bundled memory card so you?ll need to buy one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gigabyte GSmart S1205 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The GSmart S1205 is more than decently sized for a dual SIM touch phone. On a second look though, the wasted space around the screen doesn?t quite make sense. The handset measures 110.6 x 55.0 x 13.1 mm and weighs in at 114.5 grams. It feels solid in the hand, but the battery cover creaks annoyingly every now and then when you tap the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Touchscreen phones are not the best devices to get creative with design and the GSmart S1205 is no exception. It?s a simple handset, finished in black with gray accents down the side. Again, it?s a reasonably well built phone but perhaps looking a bit cheap for a PocketPC. But you know what ? that?s not too bad. After all, it is a cheap PocketPC ? and dual SIM at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte GSmart S1205 uses a 3.2? WQVGA resistive touchscreen. It?s responsive enough, but the sunlight legibility is one of the poorest we?ve ever had to deal with. The plastic over the screen is highly reflective and gets covered in fingerprints in no time, which doesn?t help at all. Basically the screen is good enough indoors and as good as useless outdoors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we find the earpiece, which acts as a loudspeaker too. There is also a small status LED next to it. It blinks in different color to indicate charging, or various active connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen, there?s a mix of hardware and buttons and touch controls. You have a touch-sensitive (resistive) Start button to access the Honeycomb launcher. The other touch control is a Phone Settings key to access the various settings of the two SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s no call management involved though, just the essential user-defined settings for the two phone modules. In between these two buttons is what looks like a home key but it doesn?t do anything other than turn on the backlighting of the two call buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further down are the call/end knobs, either side of the Center key. The latter is no Home button either ? strangely it?s a confirm button and it?s absolutely redundant on a touchscreen device. It will activate the currently selected item in a list or icon in a menu. The only time it becomes remotely usable is in some of the custom homescreens of the Smart Pack plug-in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a shame really ? a dedicated back button would?ve made so much more sense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Gigabyte GSmart S1205 features a thin volume rocker, while the right one hosts the dedicated camera key and the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no cover for the card slot and it?s likely to pick up dust Cleanup is recommended every once in a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top we find the lonely and very thin Power/Lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, at the bottom of the phone you will see the mouthpiece. The standard microUSB port accommodates both the charger and the data cable. Right next to it is the 3.5 mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing to note here is the stylus compartment. Unfortunately, there is no active stylus here ? a feature we quite liked in some PocketPCs by HTC. What?s worse though is that the stylus is essential in the Gigabyte GSmart S1205. Despite the Smart Pack customization, using this phone isn?t exactly thumb-friendly. But more on this in the interface chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the S1205 features only the 3 megapixel camera lens and the GSmart logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The material used on the rear cover is similar to HTC Desire?s soft-touch plastic ? it?s still plastic but with a soft rubbery feel for a great grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover, you'll find the two SIM card slots and the 1320 mAh battery right next to them. The SIM beds are one on top the other and have a tiny lock mechanism. Tampering with the lock switch turns off the phone immediately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte GSmart S1205 is a well-built phone. It looks cheap but we guess most of the potential customers won?t mind the cost-cutting. No fancy finish, poor screen and all, this phone is trying to deliver where it counts and the lack of competition in the dual SIM smartphone niche certainly works in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We for one wouldn?t care so much about the looks and finish. The lack of proper Home and Back keys however does make the handling a bit awkward. Anyway, compromises were obviously inevitable but the price tag takes due notice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take the jump for the custom user interface and applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Smart Pack Custom interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gigabyte GSmart S1205 runs Windows Mobile 6.5. That?s not an impressive start really ? several months now since the much fresher WinMo 6.5.3 has been around and the new Windows Phone 7 is expected in another few months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, there is some eye candy ? and a bit of functionality boost ? on top of the stock OS to make up for the missing WinMo 6.5.3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s take a closer look at the home-brewed Smart Pack. This is actually what makes the Gigabyte GSmart S1205 worth a look ? apart from the dual SIM thing. What you get is not only a revamped homescreen but three Gigabyte-made themes that will let you further customize the handling ? with quite a number of homescreen panes, various shortcuts, sweep gestures and widgetry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s nothing special about the Windows Mobile theme. You have a homescreen with customizable wallpaper and some virtual buttons (called ?items?). You can add as many items as you wish until the whole Today screen is covered with them. The items are most of the time simple small-font lines of text you can?t really tap ? stylus works way better. It doesn?t look too tidy, let alone stylish, especially on a low-res screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the Chinese Painting theme which brings you three homescreen panes. The first one (central) features four shortcuts docked at the bottom. By default, those virtual buttons are assigned to the dialer, messaging, call log and the theme switcher. Notice the small numbers below the Messages and Call Log icons ? those indicate the number of new messages and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping and holding on any of those four shortcuts will launch a menu to let you assign other functions ? you have a choice between nine items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The favorite features list is a swipe away to the right, on the next homescreen pane. Again, you can tap and hold on an item to change or remove it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A swipe to the left form the central homescreen will take you to E-mail, Call History, Contacts and Quick Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another swipe, this time upwards, leads you to the widgets ? Calculator, Notes, Windows Live, Clock, World Clock, Schedule, and Weather. A downward swipe (or pressing the hardware Confirm key), will take you to the menu. Those two screens (widgets and menu) are also available in the next two themes. They only look a bit different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other things that the three Gigabyte themes have in common are the icons on top of the homescreen. Those are somewhat oversized (bad-looking, but are finger-friendly) indicators for the battery, signal strength (for both SIM cards) and connectivity with the lock key underneath. And under the battery indicator you?ll see information on the time and date as well as a weather forecast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the battery indicator starts the Power Manager while tapping on either of the signal strength indicators will bring you to the Wireless Manager where you can switch Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and off, enable/disable any of the SIM cards and activate Airplane Mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Smart Zone theme has 9 homescreen panes, which are accessible by thumb sweeps in all four directions. The funny thing is you even have diagonal swipes. If you press the Confirm key, you?ll get a tiled view of all 9 homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The central screen displays the same information as the Chinese Painting homescreen but this time there is a large centrally located analog clock with weather readings just underneath. The rest is the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, the left screen (swipe to the right to access it) is reserved for the favorite features list and the right one ? for E-mail account, Call History, Contacts and Quick Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get to the settings screen you swipe upwards from the homescreen, while a short menu (Tools, Media, Office Mobile) is hidden in the upper screen. Windows Media is launched by a diagonal swipe downwards left to right. A downward diagonal swipe right to left reveals the Photo Album. The other two (upward) diagonal swipes will take you to the Widget screen and the Internet Explorer, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To go back from any of the panes to the central homescreen, there?s a dedicated button in the upper right corner of each screen. Right next to it, is a button that will bring up the aggregated tile view of all the screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It sounds complicated but it isn?t once you?ve spent some time with the phone. The graphics generally look poor on the low-res screen and the Smart Zone theme does look rather basic with its white background. The diagonal swipes are just too much perhaps. But some users will appreciate the number of shortcuts available on the Gigabyte GSmart S1205.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Live Nature theme is our favorite. There are no countless screens here (just the homescreen, a custom-made launcher and a widget screen) but it still is convenient enough. And reasonably attractive too ? as much as it could be on a WQVGA screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is pretty standard with one major exception ? it?s alive. There?s always something going on ? a snail will slide down a leave, cows grazing in the meadow will moo when touched, a little frog will snap at a buzzing fly. You may notice a flying kite, an airplane or a flock of birds crossing the sky, rain falling down. None of these though is informative in any way, no alerts or signals or anything. It?s all there for fun?s sake. .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Widget screen is an upward swipe away while the Application launcher menu is in the opposite direction (or accessed through the Confirm key).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the special Application menu, it?s like a list of all your applications and most important settings all in one place. It consists of three screens. The indicator on top of the display tells you which of the menu screens you?re currently looking at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer the standard  Windows honeycomb, it?s a tap away on the Start key below the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We decided to do a benchmark and see how the Gigabyte GSmart S1205 stacks up next to the much powerful Acer neoTouch, which comes with the 1GHz Snapdragon processor on board. From the screenshots bellow you may see that CPU results of the Snapdragon are 3 times better, while most of the other neoTouch benchmark results are even more impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, Gigabyte deserve some credit for trying to boost customization options. It?s not always consistent and not all of their design decisions make sense. Not to mention that the poor screen resolution does the interface little favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The respectable number of shortcuts and the level of homescreen customization are commendable. The themes are diverse enough and give users adequate choice. On the other hand, the lack of a proper Back button does affect navigation. And sadly, there are too many places in the interface where the stylus is essential.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A more thumbable phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is usually considered one of the strongest points of Windows Mobile. You have an unlimited contact list, unlimited info fields for each contact and brilliant synchronization options. Shame it's so damn ugly. Even in 6.5, Contacts remained virtually unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we like about the GSmart S1205 phonebook is the improved contact search. Apart from the tiny letters on top of the screen you get some large way more thumbable on-screen buttons with letters on them. And quite conveniently ? these are only the letters you have contacts starting with. Those allow quick gradual typing which really helps finding the contact you need pretty easy. Again, it doesn?t look good but usability is OK.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don?t like to see the quick search letter boxes, you can swipe the Contact list sideways, as indicated by an arrow. If you do, you?ll only get the actual list of contacts fill the screen. Selecting a contact reveals a call screen with two virtual buttons at the bottom: Call and Menu. Pressing Call will initiate a call on the primary SIM card ? you don?t get to choose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing ?Menu? however will bring a pop-up list of options such as delete, edit, save to card 1 or 2, assign speed dial, send text, etc. Alternatively, the same menu can be evoked by tapping and holding on a contact. The best thing though is you?ll get the options Call From SIM1 and Call From SIM2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual SIM telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls is always a priority for any cellphone ? the Dual SIM ability certainly holds the Gigabyte GSmart S1205 to a higher standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone application offers Smart dialing, so you hardly ever need to go to the Contact list to dial a number. Once you?ve dialed the number or found the contact you?re about to call, you only have to choose the SIM card to place the phone call on. On the dialpad, there are two virtual buttons: Talk1 and Talk2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone application also offers a tiny screen above the numpad with a list of recent calls. Alternatively, you can hit the History button and enter the actual Call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a phone call on either of the SIM cards, the other one is not active. So people calling you will hear an out-of-coverage or phone-switched-off message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log does reasonably well to accommodate the dual SIM functionality. It displays the type of call (incoming, outgoing, etc.), the SIM card used, the caller number/name and the number of calls. When you select a log entry, you can see the entire call history, including the time and date, as well as the call duration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a Call log entry is selected, pressing the call key will start a call on the primary SIM card ? even if the call was made or received on the secondary SIM. There?s a way around that though ? tapping and holding on a Call log item, opens a contextual pop-up menu with relevant options. Among them are Save to Contacts, Delete, Send text and ? best of all ? Call on 1 and Call on 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte S1205 scored a Good mark in our loudspeaker performance test. And here is how the S1205 stacks up against some other handsets we've tested. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging the WinMo way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte S1205 supports SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a message editor and, thanks to Windows Mobile 6.5, you can enjoy thumb scrolling in the inboxes and through longer messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the message interface is the stock Windows Mobile 6.5, where the only upgrade is the slightly touch-optimized menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threaded SMS is also available on the S1205, just as it is across Windows 6.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email editor will hold no surprises for experienced WinMo users as it has not changed at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up your email is easy as it is on most of the latest mid or high range phones. You type your email and password and all the other fiddly options are configured automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps now is a good time to mention input options on the S1205. Gigabyte have equipped the device with two pretty thumbable SPB virtual keyboards. It's a commendable feature since the default Windows Mobile keyboards are fit for stylus use only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first keyboard is a full portrait touch optimized QWERTY and the second one is the same QWERTY in landscape mode. The regular WinMo QWERTY for use with a stylus is as usual onboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handwriting recognition is also available and works just fine.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery and photo album<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gigabyte GSmart S1205 offers two galleries. Both are available from the Multimedia folder in the Start menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is the standard Windows Mobile 6.5 variety. It has no accelerometer support and you can't flick-scroll images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PhotoAlbum app is a new addition by Gigabyte and though not innovative or beautiful, is still better than the stock gallery. It's properly thumb optimized. Once an image is opened, you can zoom in or out or continue to the previous/next by finger sweeps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the PhotoAlbum app scrolling to the next image is smooth and instantaneous with a single move of the thumb.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Windows Media player for music and videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Gigabyte stopped right there and did not bother to include any custom music or video player to complement the standard Windows Media player. As usual, it's poor at managing playlists with your favorite songs, and generally has limited functionality. The interface is less than touch-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Watching varied video content is almost a no-go as there is a limited support for video formats (and codecs).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Core player is the better option<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you?re not impressed with the Windows Player, you may want to install a third-party media app such as the Core player. It successfully played all DivX/Xvid movies, except those using the AC3 audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that only videos with maximum resolution of 1008 x 1008 are supported so if you can skip the HD playback (it doesn't really make sense on a mobile screen anyway), you will be happy to know that all other videos we tried played smoothly with no audio problems or dropped frames.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran some benchmarks with the Core Player against the Acer neoTouch and the HTC Touch Diamond and here are the results.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio output of the Gigabyte GSmart S1205 is downright impressive, the handset faring great in our traditional test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to being on the louder side of the handsets we have tested so far, the S1205 achieved great scores across the board, making it impossible to find a weak spot in its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out how it does compared to some of the other devices we have tested below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte GSmart S1205 built-in FM radio naturally requires the headset to be plugged-in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio has an excellent interface and offers memory for 20 radio stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, RDS isn?t available but overall, radio is handled pretty well on the GSmart S1205.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Inadequate camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte GSmart S1205 has a 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera producing photos with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. The camera offers an intuitive user interface and shoots in landscape mode. However it doesn?t have a flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S1205 camera viewfinder is nicely touch-optimized and has all controls you may need placed on the two vertical taskbars on both sides of the viewfinder. There you can change the shooting mode, scene, timer settings, effects, adjust brightness or go to the Photo Album. To go to the advanced settings hit the arrow at the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the advanced settings, they include image resolution and default storage, white balance, ISO and other image properties (saturation, contrast and sharpness). Although the S1205 has an inbuilt GPS receiver its camera lacks geotagging support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3 megapixel shooter is nothing special in terms of image quality. Images are oversharpened (even when sharpness is set to 0), but with good contrast and acceptable color rendering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Noise levels are normally quite high and the aggressive noise reduction that kicks in takes its toll on resolved detail. At 100% magnification there's easily visible watercolor effect on most surface textures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the lack of detail in images is a major weakness along with the limited dynamic range, which easily leads to underdeveloped shadows or blown highlights.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Gigabyte GSmart S1205. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, the Gigabyte GSmart S1205 can offer VGA resolution at 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is identical to the one of the still camera. Unfortunately, there is no image stabilization of any kind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos shot with the S1205 turned out pretty nice. While we would?ve been happier to see more detail and less compression artifacts, the contrast and the actual frame rate are quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: no 3G<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connectivity, the Gugabyte GSmart S1205 is struggling to match most midrange PocketPC?s. While it packs quad-band GSM support for both SIM cards, it lacks 3G support so the best you get is EDGE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least, there is Wi-Fi so if there is a hotspot nearby you could take advantage of it. Bluetooth with EDR and A2DP is also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S1205 comes with a microUSB port and USB 2.0 support. When connected to a computer, the GSmart S1205 prompts you to select among ActiveSync or Mass Storage mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Mass Storage mode, the memory card is treated as a removable drive. The only downside is in this mode you have no access to the memory card from the handset itself ? the card becomes invisible to the file manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser: not enough processing power and no accelerometer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, this is the really interesting part ? the preloaded version of the Internet Explorer Mobile web browser packs a nice touch-optimized interface and a cool skin. It sports kinetic scrolling and full Flash support, and looks set to give you the browsing experience that it fails to deliver on competing devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming is easiest with double tapping on-screen. Double taps are certainly more comfortable than the alternative zoom bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no built-in accelerometer so don?t expect the screen to rotate automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately page load times are awful even on Wi-Fi. Scrolling speed is passable though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera Mobile web browser is still the best among the Windows Mobile browsers and is available for free download. Even optimized, Internet Explorer still has a lot of catching up to do.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gigabyte GSmart S1205 features the standard time PIM features as any other WinMo-powered device and a full office package with editing. As far as the apps are concerned, there is only one worth mentioning - the Pocket Backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It allows you to save your data before you upgrade the phone?s software and restore it when the system upgrade is ready. You can choose which items to be covered by the backup but what is far more interesting, you can schedule the next backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte GSmart S1205 comes with a built-in GPS receiver. Unfortunately, the S1205 has no SatNav software preinstalled - not even Google Maps. Anyway, it takes only a few clicks to get the Google Maps up and running on the GSmart S1205 and the handset got satellite lock reasonably fast.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte GSmart 1205 isn?t a phone you?ll instantly like. The cheap finish and the poor screen are no match for most other PocketPC?s out there, not even some pretty old ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But then, it?s not this phone?s job to lure and seduce. It?s simply waiting to be discovered by the practical buyer. It may take a while before you know it?s a PocketPC, and Dual SIM isn?t inscribed in gilded letters. But that?s what it is ? a dual SIM PocketPC. Now, good luck trying to beat that, HTC, Sony Ericsson and the like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, not only is the Gigabyte GSmart 1205 a dual SIM PocketPC ? it?s one of the cheapest PocketPCs ever. Seems the right thing to do really when you know you can?t compete with HDs and XPERIAs. A bargain is welcome ? no doubt about that, but the GSmart 1205 is cheap and it means it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we think it?s up to every user to make up their mind about all the implied compromises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There isn?t much going on in the dual SIM market, and the GSmart S1205 is virtually competition-free considering it?s a smartphone too. Potential shoppers should have that in mind too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The year-old Acer DX900 is in fact the only real rival. It has a smaller but higher-res display, faster processor and 3G connectivity with HSDPA support. The Acer runs the older Windows Mobile 6.1 though. Available for only about 30 euro more than Gigabyte?s phone, the Acer DX900 is worth checking out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer DX900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GX500 and Samsung B5722 are feature phones with dual SIM support. The LG handset comes with Wi-Fi and a similar screen, while the Samsung?s B5722 has no premium features and a smaller QVGA display. The LG GX500 is priced about the same as the GSmart S1205, so the smartphone is perhaps the better choice. Samsung B5722 on the other hand is some 70 euro cheaper and budget-conscious users might want to consider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s plenty of decent smartphones on offer in this price range. If dual-SIM isn?t a must, you?ll do well to check out the equally priced HTC Tattoo and Nokia 5800 XpressMusic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Tattoo ? Nokia 5800 XpressMusic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gigabyte GSmart S1205 is an easy phone to bash. There?re so many things about it that are not up to scratch. But in the same time it is as good as bullet-proof thanks to a single unique feature. It always takes something extra to keep a phone afloat ? be it looks, imaging, you name it. Dual-SIM is the insurance policy of the Gigabyte Gsmart S1205. The gentle price tag gives it a good start. It isn?t going anywhere further than its narrow market niche. But it?s a niche it can call its won.</paragraph>
