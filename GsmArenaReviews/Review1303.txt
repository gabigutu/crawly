			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 701 is the torch bearer in a generation shift for Symbian. Belle is a bold stylistic step forward and the Nokia 701 is the first in a trio of phones that will introduce it to the world. The Nokia R&amp;D team left nothing to chance with this one - proven design, a brilliant screen and a 1GHz processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 701 is based on the C7. The styling must be a Nokia favorite as they reused it in the gold-plated Oro too. As long as it's the same solid and fairly slim, alloy body we're not complaining.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 701 enjoys solid hardware upgrade too. A 1GHz CPU coupled with 512MB RAM is much more than what the lightweight Symbian OS is used to and the 1,000 nit display outshines competing screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not everything has changed though, here's the overview.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 701 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The next generation ClearBlack display is based on the IPS LCD technology and promises amazing brightness and 160-degree viewing angles. It's also protected by the popular Gorilla Glass, so you don't have to worry about scratches ruining your viewing experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC will be a major part of the Nokia experience (they have plans to start enabling it on all their devices) and that, of course, includes the 701. It's a great addition to the connectivity set, which is brimming with features already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, get your old maps ready. Our usual hardware tour begins and we've got the feeling we'll be playing "spot the differences" all the way through.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 701 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The exact measurements of the Nokia 701 are 117.2 x 56.8 x 11 mm (64cc) and 131 grams.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Okay, so the Nokia 701 won't win any awards for original design, but the iPhone went three generations without fear of becoming boring. The rounded corners give the Nokia 701 a pleasant look and the sturdy shell made mostly of metal feels quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen merits a chapter of its own, so let's get the rest of the hardware out of the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display is the earpiece with proximity and ambient light sensors and a VGA video call camera keeping it company. Below the display are the three hardware keys ? Menu, Answer and Ignore. The call keys are easy to hit but the Menu key is slightly on the thin side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One design flaw we found here is that it's too close to the screen and sometimes you'd press both the key and the screen. The Menu key on the C7 was placed slightly lower and the problem was avoided, so we don't know why Nokia moved it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mic pinhole is located just below the menu key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of the Nokia 701 features the power key, which also handles screen lock and the ringing profiles. The two wired connectivity ports are here too ? the microUSB has a plastic flap (and can be used for charging), while the 3.5mm audio jack is left exposed. That one doubles as a TV-Out port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the 701 would have been completely bare if it wasn?t for the 2mm charger plug. The right side is much busier ? the volume keys flank the voice command key, and further down we find the screen-lock slider and the shutter key. It cannot be half-pressed as the camera on the Nokia 701 lacks auto-focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is small and almost flush against the side of the phone, making it rather uncomfortable to press. This might result in some extra camera shake ? you might want to use the on-screen shutter to prevent that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 701?s bottom side features just the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back we find the camera lens, dual-LED flash and loudspeaker banded together on a silver strip. The phone rests down on the camera, perhaps making the lens prone to scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though there are two symmetrical grills, only one of them (the one next to the lens) is an actual loudspeaker ? the other one is there just for the sake of symmetry, we guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is metal and very pleasant to the touch. It?s held in place by a latch found at the bottom. Adjacent to the latch is the second microphone, which is used for noise cancellation and stereo sound for videos - you should be careful not to cover it with your palm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping the cover open reveals the 1300mAh Li-Ion battery (BL-5K). The 701 boasts some impressive battery life on paper - 17 hours of talk time in 2G (only about 7 hours in 3G), 21 or 23 days of standby in 2G and 3G respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t end there - Nokia's official specs promise nearly 9 hours of video watching, 6 hours 25 minutes of video recording (if you have the storage for it), almost 3 hours of video calling, 11 hours of navigation (free navigation courtesy of Nokia Maps) and the really impressive 3 days of music playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 701 has the same problem as the C7 - the SIM card compartment is easily accessible once you pop open the back cover. But you can't get to the microSD card slot as that is behind the battery (not under it, behind it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the 701 you get typically good Nokia build quality and the mostly metal shell really gives it a sense of solidity. The scratch-resistant glass and metal build offer good durability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We played with the Silver Light color version and it's quite a looker. It's not the most compact phone around, but the elongated shape of the Nokia 701 makes it fit just right in the hand and it should slip into pretty much any pocket without a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Brilliant IPS-LCD ClearBlack display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Nokia 701 is mostly taken by the next-generation ClearBlack display - 3.5? IPS-LCD display of nHD resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you could expect, the blacks aren't quite in the same league as those of the AMOLED ClearBlacks but the 1,000 nits of brightness make up for that. It's the brightest display we've seen, not counting the Nokia E6 (which was much smaller).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The balance of this is excellent contrast ratios - 1470:1 at full brightness and 1818:1 at 50% brightness. Those are very impressive figures, pretty much the best we've seen on a non-AMOLED screen (the E6 comes close too). Here's the table that compares brightness and contrast among the phone's we've tested. You can learn more about the test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen brightness helps achieve excellent sunlight legibility too, beating the likes of the SuperAMOLED Plus and the first-gen ClearBlack displays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IPS technology promises 160-degree viewing angles and for the most part delivers. There's a slight but noticeable loss of contrast when you tilt the phone, but there's no color shift.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel count of Nokia 701's screen is just 60% of WVGA screens (common in high-end phones), but as this is a smaller screen the pixel density is virtually identical to that of the Galaxy S II, for example (210 ppi for the 701 vs. 217 ppi for the S II).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sharpness is okay but you can notice jaggies on circles (or just rounded corners like the menu icons) and diagonal lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 701 screen sensitivity is as good as we?ve come to expect from capacitive units. The excellent haptic feedback is a boost to usability.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Looking good, Symbian Belle<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian Belle marks the biggest change in Symbian UI since... well, it's been so long, hasn?t it? The platform has found new life since Nokia put it out to pasture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been a regular one on our list of Cons that Symbian is lagging behind Android and iOS in user experience, but Belle is a leap forward. The key elements are the new homescreen and menu, the updated native apps and overall polish of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an extensive video demo of the interface, so you can get a good feel of Belle before we start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widget system introduced by Symbian^3 was incomplete to say the least. Now, you get up to six homescreens (up from three) and you can delete unneeded ones. Each homescreen has its own individual wallpaper, rather than one for all to share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets themselves have dropped the one-size-fits-all philosophy and now come in up to five sizes. Widgets are resizable too. In addition to widgets, you can also put shortcuts on the homescreen - the end of the silly shortcut widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a widget or shortcut activates edit mode, but only for that widget/shortcut. You can move it, delete it or (where available) access its settings. While editing one widget, you can touch others - there's no mode where you can edit everything at once (which is a bit inconvenient to us).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the homescreen has three virtual buttons - menu, dialer and homescreen settings. With these buttons, Nokia can go button-free at the front if they want to, just like they did with MeeGo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other big addition to the homescreen is the pull down menu at the top of the screen - think Android's notification area or the similar menu available in iOS 5. This area is where notifications wait in line for your attention, but you also get toggles for mobile data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This pull down menu is available on any screen so you can also quickly change a setting and look up new events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, the main menu has changed as well - it's now completely flat, no level upon level of subfolders nonsense any more. Or at least not by default - you could still manually create folders if you like. You also sort icons alphabetically or manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose the Arrange option and move menu items around, but you can't drop a shortcut in a folder. To do that, you have to press and hold on a shortcut, choose Move to folder and then select the desired folder. There are also Add to homescreen and delete options here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This arrangement isn't as convenient as in other OSes and it contrasts with how the homescreen works. On the homescreen you press and hold to move an item, while a tap and hold on a menu item pulls out a menu. To move items around you have to hit the Options key and choose Arrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager in Symbian Belle is virtually unchanged - press and hold the Menu key and it pops up. It fits three thumbnails of the currently open apps. It's worth noting that hitting the End key will terminate an app, while pressing the Menu key just goes to the homescreen with the app active in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian Belle feels very smooth, which is probably due to a combination of the new software and the faster hardware. The faster CPU (1GHz) and more RAM (512MB, double that of previous models) mean that even heavy multitaskers won't have issues - Symbian requires way less resources than Android, for example.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Better 8MP fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 701 comes with an 8MP fixed-focus camera for a maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. In dark scenes, a dual-LED flash lends a hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface has changed since Anna (it's even different from the Nokia N8 camera update), but the changes are mostly cosmetic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen, you get a row of shortcuts: Back, Flash mode, Scenes, Extended options and Menu. The latter lets you toggle between the front and rear camera, launch the user guide or exit the camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right, there's a the virtual shutter key (often preferable over the physical one, which is hard to press) and a toggle for the still/video modes. On the left, there's a digital zoom lever that auto-hides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the extended options you get more goodies like face detection, self timer, image settings (ISO, white balance, sharpness, etc.) and a shortcut to one last group of settings where you have geotagging and capture tone options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were sorely disappointed when we tried to change the ISO setting - it's a list (Auto, Low, Med, High) and you tap once to select and once again to activate. The Sharpness setting works the same way. Really, Nokia? It's just sad to insist on this ham-fisted approach to menus with each new version of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, as far as image quality goes it's actually improved since the Nokia C7. The default settings no longer produce over-sharpened the image, though you can see halos around high-contrast areas and the images turn up a little grainy because of the sharpened noise from the sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Nokia 701 captures good amounts of fine detail. One thing that could be improved is the dynamic range - contrast is good but at the cost of blown out areas in the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried reducing the sharpness setting in the camera and that helped out by taking a lot of the graininess out of the photos. That, of course, made the image noticeably softer - ideally, you'd shoot with sharpness set to "soft" and sharpen images manually later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If that seems like too much hassle, go with the default settings - they're good enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>720p video recording is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera captures 720p@30fps footage with stereo sound, courtesy of the dedicated second microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is virtually identical to the still camera interface. Among the options are scenes, video light, video stabilization, you can toggle audio recording and geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a great grid option, which not only shows the rule of thirds grid, but also marks the viewfinder in a cinema-like 21:9 frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video capture was one area where Nokia's 8MP fixed-focus cameras perform surprisingly well and the Nokia 701 is no exception. Videos are shot in MP4 files with about 10Mbps bitrate and 127Kbps stereo sound at 48 kHz, which earns points for the 701.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos run at a smooth 30 frames per second, with no duplicated frames. The amount of captured detail is good, but again the low dynamic range leads to blown out areas (the shadow in the trees and the clouds, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the quality for yourselves, here's a sample we uploaded to YouTube:.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a  720p@30fps (18.2MB, 0:12s) video sample straight from the Nokia 701 for direct download.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browser improved, a bit<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The browser interface has been shuffled a bit, resulting in improved usability but nothing major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top you have the URL bar, which auto-hides ones you start navigating the page. Once you start typing a "Search for..." pop-up lets you choose one of several search engines (Google and Bing are offered in most locations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom you have a fixed row with five shortcuts - Back, Forward, Bookmarks, Tabs and Menu. The addition of the Tabs shortcut makes managing multiple pages easier - in earlier versions you had to go through the popup menu, adding a few extra clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The popup menu itself is pretty much the same - you get RSS feeds, find on page, Most visited and other options, along with a "More" option, which brings the final set of options for the browser (but you'd rarely need to use those).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text reflow is supported, which makes reading sites meant for desktop that much easier on the mobile screen. Kinetic scrolling is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports FlashLight 4 and promises to play YouTube videos at 360p, but we'll leave those tests for the review when we have more time with the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser felt fluid and fast when we panned around a page and zoomed in and out. We didn?t really see any pages break in the browser either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has spruced up the Symbian browser in Belle and claim it's now three times faster. We couldn?t verify that claim as we couldn?t find a benchmark that worked well on both Anna and Belle. We'll try again for the review, maybe we'll find a benchmark that works properly on both by then.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity covers all bases<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We don't usually cover connectivity in our previews, but the Nokia 701 is worth an exception with that impressive list of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, the basics. You get a true worldwide-ready phone: quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and five-band 3G with HSDPA (14.4Mbps) and HSUPA (5.76Mbps). Wherever there's a GSM network you'd get voice calls and data, blazing fast data if the networks supports it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then for local connectivity, you get Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 3.0 (no HS profile though). There's USB with On-The-Go support for wired connectivity. The 3.5mm audio jack doubles as a composite TV-out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's even an FM transmitter, so that you can easily play your music on your car's stereo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star of the show however is the NFC support - it makes pairing as simple as you could possibly imagine, just put two NFC-enabled gadgets (e.g. the 701 and headset) together and the two will pair. Hooray, no more PIN codes!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sending stuff works the same way - select the files you want to send (one or many) and tap the two phones together. They'll handle the rest, including switching on the Bluetooth receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would have been nice to have Wi-Fi Direct or Bluetooth 3.0+HS to speed up file transfers, but unless you're sending long HD videos, things go fast enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While we weren't wowed by the hardware (well, okay - the screen is pretty impressive), the new Symbian Belle felt almost revolutionary. Maybe if it had come out earlier, it would have helped Symbian cling to its top spot in smartphone platforms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's still rough around some edges and lags behind in some areas, but it would be nearly impossible to convince us to go back to the old Symbian (even Anna) now that we've tasted Belle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a way, the Nokia 701 is the 5800 XpressMusic of its generation - it leads the way, without necessarily being a flagship. It worked out quite well last time and the 5800 sold with millions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 701 certainly has enough items on its spec sheet along with enough bragging points (the 1,000 nit screen, powerful chipset and brand new OS plus excellent connectivity) to have a good shot at replicating that success.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Will it? Maybe, we'll wait and see. But it should be a welcome breather for Nokia until they muscle in on the market with Windows Phone 7.</paragraph>
