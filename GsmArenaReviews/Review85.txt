			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android is set on grabbing the number two spot in the smartphone market by 2012 and the Samsung I7500 Galaxy might be the type of phone to get it there. Perhaps less for the Galaxy at this point, and more for the Samsung, but we'll see about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The I7500 Galaxy is a "Google experience" phone, and has the intrinsic advantage of having the search giant's infrastructure behind its back. For one, YouTube and Picasa integration sure add value to the 5-megapixel camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And as to people who spend their time digging around the Internet for oft hard to find information, we really appreciate the improved search widget. And that thingy is about to get better - Android is a bit like Google's other projects, a perpetual work in progress that keeps getting new features and polishes the occasional rough edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The I7500 Galaxy is the company's first take on Android but if we put the OS aside, it should be a solid Samsung touchscreen with all the gadgetry we've got used to in smartphones. Of course, the Android platform still has a few issues to address and get some annoying limitations out of the way. Let's see what this here Android by Samsung can do for you and where it might fail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have established a strong presence in the touchscreen market. Their usual weapon of choice is TouchWiz, which brings PocketPCs and feature phones closer together, projecting a consistent brand image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Galaxy, they're stepping out of their comfort zone - a new OS and a new interface. TouchWiz for Android is yet to come (and in the case of I7500 never is more likely than later).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make sure it does well, Samsung have equipped the Galaxy to match to specs of the top Android phones available on the market. And it sure needs every bit of ammo if it's going to challenge the well-entrenched HTC Hero. The I7500 Galaxy can take it on spec for spec and even win a few rounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that's on paper, and we guess you're curious to see the real deal. Jump to the next page for this Einstein's worth of a question: what is the Galaxy made of?</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I7500 Galaxy 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 115 x 56 x 11.9 mm this is the slimmest Android phone on the market yet - even if by a whisker. There's no chin this time around, so despite its size it can comfortably slip into a pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the Galaxy is not a small phone by any means and has all the advantages of size. How about that AMOLED capacitive screen for starters? But that big Android is still quite comfortable to handle. The weight of 119 grams isn't quite as breezy as some Symbian phones, but it's on par with the HTC Magic and lighter than the Apple iPhone (whichever the generation).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung decided to put stock Android on the I7500 instead of going the modders way covering everything up in a custom UI. And we can't say that this is a bad thing, but we'll get to that. What's important here is that design-wise the Galaxy has Samsung written all over it - figuratively speaking, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only when the screen lights up do you realize that Android's inside. The screen is easily the best part of the hardware - a 3.2" HVGA capacitive OLED touchscreen. The size of the screen stretches the resolution a little thin but the lively colors and great contrast do add up to some pleasing image quality. Not to mention the extremely good viewing angles, which seem almost unmatched from what we've seen so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's more the screen is very responsive. It reacts to your thumb with amazing speed and precision that make the interface appear surprisingly snappy. However it suffers from the low sunlight legibility that's quite typical of AMOLED screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy front hardware buttons are generously sized and have a very pleasant click. You won't mind using them at all, even with such an excellent screen. A trackball is no longer the Android rule, in fact it's something of an HTC trademark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back key is obvious enough, but the menu key is marked by an arrow pointing up from a square bracket. That doesn't exactly scream "menu". The home key - that looks like an Nseries multimedia knob - is squeezed between the back and end button. This Home key is small but comfortably raised, so pressing it is trouble free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as key assignment is concerned, you can download the free application "Spare Parts" off the Market. It will let you make minor tweaks including the behavior of the End button. You can set whether the End key should lock the phone, return to home screen or go to homescreen and then lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The styling of the phone is quite plain, more on the cheap than the conservative side. It's plastic all around, and the silvery accents on the control and navigation pad do little to glam up the simple black front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the I7500 Galaxy are not that different from the typical Samsung touch-operated handset. On the left there's just the volume rocker. The right-hand side has the shutter key, which can be half-pressed to handle autofocus, and a hold key. The shutter key is very soft and responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top has the microUSB port, a lanyard eyelet and a standard 3.5mm audio jack. The USB port is covered, but the audio jack is left exposed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic rear is rather plain - uninspiring piano black finish and flat as a pool table. The only things to note are the lens with flash beneath, loudspeaker grill and the lonely Samsung logo (for whatever reason, there's no Google logo this time as opposed to the first sample we had for early previewing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens is placed in the top left corner, so your support finger occasionally gets in the way of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel autofocus camera lens is enclosed in a slightly raised frame, which also accommodates the LED flash. This frame is the lens' only mean of protection against scratches. The loudspeaker grill has two small nubs, so it doesn't get muffled on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the easily accessible SIM compartment. Unfortunately, that's how you get to the microSD card slot as well. The memory card slot is under the battery cover, but the card can be swapped without removing the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the back cover often results in the battery popping out so be careful when you're swapping out the memory card. On the plus side, the back cover has "ribs", which make it sturdier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is massive - 1500mAh are said to keep the Galaxy up and running for up to 450 hours and allow up to 9 hours of talk time. It may as well, in a controlled environment. In reality we had to charge the phone rather often - almost every day at some point when testing was getting too intense.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung I7500 Galaxy handles nicely even if it's not the most compact of phones, and the hardware controls are quite roomy. It sits well in the hand, its 11.9mm of thickness count for a lot of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Plain Jane styling borders are a bit on the cheap and come out a bit too boring for a handset that's debuting a brand new OS in the Samsung portfolio. The handset has a distinct Samsung face though and the brand's loyal customers will perhaps appreciate that. The other positive thing is that we have no reason to question the phone's long-term durability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the next page we make good on our promise to explain why we liked the plain Android.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface is standard Android<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android UI is no longer sight unseen but for the review to be complete, we'll go through it once again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's the best part - it's a mature implementation and has been optimized and polished of bugs. It feels extremely zippy, at first we thought it was a faster CPU. Nope, it's the same old 528MHz CPU but the interface can run circles around the original G1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough of how fast it is, let's look at what it actually does. The focal point of the interface is the homescreen. Maybe it's because of its aspirations to be a netbook instant-on OS but it looks closer to a desktop than a mobile phone's homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is three times the size of the display, giving you enough room to organize all the items you want to put up front. And there are plenty of things that can go up there. The screen shows you one third of the screen and you can sweep left or right to get to the other panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the homescreen there are three major types of items - the good old shortcuts, then folders and finally, widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, shortcuts are just like the shortcuts on your desktop computer, so not much to explain here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders can help you keep the shortcuts organized but you can't put folders within folders. Still, they can be used for a few quick tricks - like faking a quick-dial contact list. A shortcut to a contact uses that contact's photo so all you have to do is put them in a folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But this is hardly very interesting - it's when live folders come into play that it gets exciting. The main difference to ordinary folders is that the live folders are automatically filled with content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All sorts of lists can go into Live folders - for example, you can have a folder that contains all the tweets from a contact, or an RSS feed, or maybe even a folder with all the good restaurants within walking distance from a given location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled Live folders are "Contacts with phone numbers" and "Starred contacts". They are filled with your Gmail contacts that either have phone numbers or are starred. We would have loved to see more - Live folders are a great feature, and quite novel - but if it isn't promoted right, it might not pick up at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other inhabitants of the Android homescreen are the widgets. There are two new preinstalled widgets that come with the Android v1.5 - a calendar and music player. The music player widget is simple enough - it has a play/pause button, a skip button and shows the currently running track name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The traditional search widget got an update and now shows suggestions as you type, just like the Google homepage. In Android v1.6 the widget will get a further update allowing it to search for local files as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar widget is a little limited - it only shows upcoming events. That's nice since it manages to fit even long event descriptions but it doesn't have a monthly view mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new widgets (although it seems to be an app technically) is the "Switchers". It provides a quick and convenient way to switch GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Auto sync on and off. Its downside is that it provides no means to search and connect to a wireless network for example. Unless, it's an already configured network, you need to go through the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Android is the notification area. It's a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you slide it down you get a list of all recent notifications - that's the so called notifications area. Tapping on one of the listed notifications takes a context relevant action - for instance, a tap on a notification of a successful installation would launch that application; a finished download notification will open the file and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since you can open the notification area from wherever the top bar is visible, new events won't interrupt your work. You can pull the tray down like a window blind just enough to see more details about what has happened and if it doesn't need your immediate atention you can let it roll back up and continue where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sometimes you don't even have to slide - upon receiving a new SMS the first few words of it flash in the status bar, giving you a general idea what it's about.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Virtual on-screen keyboard for small robotic fingers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Samsung I7500 Galaxy all you have to type with is the virtual on-screen keyboard. It does the whole-letter pop up each time you press a key but there's something to look out for - three dots under the letter. If those appear, a press and hold will bring up all available related symbols - the letter with all the diacritics for example. The keyboard also auto rotates to landscape thanks to the accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The I7500 virtual keys are smallish - especially in portrait mode - and typing could be very error-prone. Otherwise, the keyboard offers helpful features like a ".com" button when you're typing an URL, or a "Next" button when there are more fields to fill in, with that button changing to "Done" at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will notice that the Apple iPhone keyboard is physically larger. The larger screen estate surely adds to that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android UI 101<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here we'll make a quick list of the basic ways to interact with the Android UI for those who haven't used one before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The "task switcher" is not really a task switcher, nor is it a task manager. Android automatically opens and closes applications. When resources start to run out, it might close a currently inactive app but it will restore it back to just how you left it. It's more like the system puts the app to hibernation instead of closing it. Still, the task switcher is useful as it gives you access to the six most recently used apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gesture lock, the secret handshake<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gesture locks are gaining momentum and a cutting-edge OS like Android is bound to have them. While some versions require that the pattern is a letter, the Android way is to draw a pattern. The phone can be set to require a preset pattern of onscreen sweeps each time you're unlocking it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way it works is you're presented with a 3 x 3 grid of dots and you have to connect at least four dots in whatever order you choose. We'd advise against using too complex shapes, as you have to draw the shape again if you are to cancel or change it, so forgetting it would be an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose to have haptics enabled so with a little training you can unlock the phone without looking at the grid. There's even an option to disable the trail that connects the dots completing the pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The letter-based locks have the advantage of different letters doing different things - not just unlock, but even launch an app. Android doesn't have it yet but maybe it will get it in the next snack-named version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has fields for everything, but no groups<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can store quite a lot of information. It lets you input numbers for work and home, and you can even create custom labels. There is of course an email field and you can assign a custom ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add IM nickname info to the contact as well as a postal address, company and job title, several notes, you name it. Quite interesting is the option to redirect calls directly to voicemail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a contact the various details are displayed in sections. There is a Dial number and a Send SMS/MMS tab with the numbers for the contact listed. Each number fills an entire horizontal row so that it's more thumbable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email also has a dedicated tab that works just like the ones for numbers. The rest of the information (if any) is displayed underneath.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a photo to a contact is quite easy: when you select a photo, a cropping tool comes up allowing you to use any photo you want. Adding a photo has another pleasing "side effect" - if you put a dialing shortcut for the contact on the screen, it uses the photo as an icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching for a contact in the phonebook is quite easy - just hit the search key and a search box pops up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony desperately needs smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy reception is quite good as is the voice quality. However, the sound strength is low even on the loudest settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alas, the phonebook on the I7500 Galaxy has a problem that should have been solved - there's no smart dialing. In Android the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. You can search the phone book but that's still not as convenient as smart dialing. The HTC Hero had it, so we guess that Samsung just didn't bother with the effort. Voice dialing is also missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: chat all the way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The SMS and MMS messaging section is quite straightforward and simple at first glance - there are no folders here, just a new message button. It doesn't stay like that for long - under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a thread, the newest message is placed at the bottom, just like with the iPhone. At the bottom of the display is the tap-to-compose box and the send key, of course. There is a counter on the right which is displayed once you have 16 or fewer characters remaining to the 160 limit. It also shows the number of parts the message will be split into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating since even if you hide the keyboard, the text box with the message still occupies the same small part of the screen giving you quite a small part of the text to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The list of recipients is maintained in a "Name " format, which is a welcome improvement over version 1.0, which added only the numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any unsent messages and drafts are marked with a red "Draft" label. What we really like is that each thread keeps the text in the tap-to-compose box even if you exit without sending it or explicitly save it. The "undelivered messages" section however has been removed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you wish to manage a specific message in the history, you can press and hold a message to bring up options such as edit, forward and delete as well as view details and copy message text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you get a new message, your whole messaging history with that person is pushed to the top of the messaging menu, no matter when your last conversation took place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold in the tap-to-compose area gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text into any other application like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail functionality and looks have also seen some changes compared to the G1. The most important new feature is the batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a standard email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. Sadly, the emails are not displayed in threaded pattern like those in the Gmail app, but you still have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, the folders are organized in a tree structure - one click over a specific folder reveals its contents and the second click closes it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The G-Talk network is compatible with some popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of both the Gmail and the generic Email apps has been slighly polished with several icons in the menus changed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia not as rich as possible<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery automatically locates the images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images and videos located in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right next to the name is a number indicating how many items are in that folder. Each sub-gallery has a thumbnail, which displays either the latest image (if the folder contains less than four images) or four thumbs if there are at least four files in this folder. There is no way to change these viewing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the main Gallery there are two new shortcuts that allow you to start recording videos or capture images. On the other hand, the flip orientation shortcut is now gone as there is system-wide UI auto-rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, there still is no option for multiple marking of images for mass cut/copy/delete. However scrolling thumbs of images up and down is even smoother and quicker now. Caching images may take quite a while when you open a gallery for the first time, but once that's done, they are loaded almost instantaneously even if a folder contains thousands of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in and out has also been improved in this version of the OS. You can zoom to 100% with simple a double tap on the screen. The gradual zoom is on bigger steps now, which we find to be much more convenient. Another addition is the crop key in the contextual menu in an opened image.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player, the Spartan way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were quite disappointed with the lack of a video player in the original version of Android (although we found a silly hack to view 3gp files via email). And when the HTC Magic came it could play videos from the gallery but had no dedicated application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the I7500 Galaxy has one on board? well, sort of. It's about as simple as you can make it - once you hit the video player icon you get a list of all videos available on the phone. And the controls while playing a video boil down play/pause, next and previous buttons, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The I7500 Galaxy video player seems to support only the H.263 codec but since the application crashed when trying to play other files, we suspect it's still not finished. And we were certainly hoping for DivX support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing the app really needs is some UI to filter videos like the one in the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player has a unique trick<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the music player has four large buttons, which offer the four main ways to search in your music collection - by artist, album, song or choose one of the playlists you've created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the music player hasn't changed much. It has that great feature that allows you to quickly look up a song in YouTube or through Google search by holding down a finger on a song. What's even better, the YouTube search results are loaded Straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides gradual typing for searching a specific song, there is an alphabetical slider, which appears on the right side of the track list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are still some shortcomings of the music player that need addressing, though. There are still no equalizer presets, nor any alternative visualizations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of the Samsung I7500 Galaxy is certainly the best among the Android handsets that we have tested so far. It?s not that it is that much better in every aspect than, say, HTC Hero, but the more balanced output it gives will be better appreciated by users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The low noise level and the good dynamic range are the strong points of the Galaxy performance, while the rest of the readings are decent, to say the least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is much better than the shaky result that we got from HTC Hero. The distortion levels of the Galaxy are also several times lower so we would be pleased to say that Android took another step towards the best on the market in terms of audio quality with the Samsung I7500.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see what this Galaxy is up to for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera is good, but needs more user-configurability<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I7500 Galaxy has a 5MP camera with autofocus and LED flash. The photos are very good but we're afraid we can't say the same for video recording or the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface? well, there is none to speak of, really! Start the camera and you get a viewfinder with a virtual shutter button in the top-right corner and a gallery button in the top-left, which displays a thumbnail of the last photo taken. And that's it - kinda reminds of the iPhone, doesn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, the Menu key brings up three more buttons - Switch to video, another Gallery button and Settings. Settings sounds a bit too ambitious really - all you get there is switching geo-tagging on or off, setting "low" or "high" video quality, some flash options (on, off or auto), and storage preferences. You don't even get to choose a different resolution for the photos, let alone things like white balance or ISO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the photos that come out of the I7500 are actually pretty good. The contrast is fine and the noise is kept comfortably low. There are slight signs of oversharpening but nothing major. Despite the lack of a dedicated macro mode, making close-ups is no problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still have some nitpicks though. The images get a bit cropped at the top and bottom and the preview of a photo you've just taking shows a slightly different aspect ratio. You can't skip the preview by pressing the shutter, like on most other phones. We did it by habit and got plenty of shots of our shoes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Galaxy. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording is far from what we?d expect from a 5MP snapper. It?s not only the low resolution (CIF@30fps), the videos are under such heavy compression, that there?s practically no point discussing image quality ? they just don?t cut it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample video to give you a better impression.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity all-rounder<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I7500 Galaxy offers excellent all-round connectivity. The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support makes the handset capable of international roaming. From then on, tri-band 3G ensures fast network data with speeds ramped up by the 7.2Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most convenient local connectivity options - Wi-Fi is also onboard. With the Switchers app on the homescreen, managing the wireless connections is easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately Bluetooth connectivity is still crippled - its usage is only limited to headset support. The A2DP profile is good to have but what we really would have liked is file transfer and an option for wireless tethering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy also sports a microUSB port. The only supported mode is USB Mass storage though - synchronization is over-the-air, syncing up with your Gmail account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've connected the handset via the original cable, you should check your notifications area by sliding it down. You will find a USB connection notification there, that allows you to mount your phone via USB. It's only then that your Galaxy will appear as a removable drive on your computer. The memory card and the 8GB of internal storage show up as two removable drives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is excellent, save for the missing Flash support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy web browser is based on the same open source WebKit used in Chrome and Safari, and this accounts for the smooth user experience. Pages load quickly, and touch navigation is very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you may suspect, the Android browser is fast and the interface clean. But unlike so many of its smartphone siblings, Flash support is not available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite having a capacitive touchscreen, the Galaxy does not support multi-touch unless tweaked. This means that right out of the box pinch zooming is not an option. You will have to rely on the two virtual zoom buttons at the bottom of the screen or on the familiar double tap routine which works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser also allows you to have multiple web pages open at the same time. If you hit the Windows button in the browser menu, you will see all the currently opened pages and you can choose which one of them to view. Switching from one page to another involves smooth transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android team added a rather nifty function to help you read even when you've zoomed out to the max. This is a small rectangle which acts like a magnifier and enables you to read small portions of the microscopic web page. You can move it with your finger and sometimes it can be quite useful. But in the end, this is just another zoom option since the moment you release your finger, the magnifier disappears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser handled perfectly most of the pages we threw at it and we are very satisfied with the results. The capacitive screen coupled with the browser's performance makes surfing on the I7500 a real treat, Flash support the only thing missing really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course a YouTube application onboard but Flash content doesn't start nor end with YouTube. At least the browser automatically suggests opening the video in the YouTube app while browsing the site. This works just for YouTube however.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer syncs with the cloud, lacks a document viewer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I7500 Galaxy comes with no document viewer preinstalled - no Quickoffice this time around. Here the Market jumped to the rescue and we quickly found Documents To Go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The free version is just a viewer for Word and Excel files (no PowerPoint), but the paid app offers editing as well as a PDF viewer. Another cool feature of the paid version is that it adds a recent documents live folder. It works well enough, but suffers from some annoying limitations (e.g. no zoom in the free version).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about it, is that the viewer integrates with the Gmail app as well, which makes viewing attachments easy. Unfortunately, you are unable to save them in the phone's memory (that only works for images, we guess). Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At any rate, not having a document viewer out of the box is a disadvantage for a high-end smartphone, especially in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are big enough and very comfy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy features a decent alarm clock application which allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Galaxy packs the YouTube app which partially compensates for the web browser's lack of Flash video support. Its interface is simple enough to allow you to find what you're looking for as quickly as possible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy comes with a capable GPS receiver, which coupled with A-GPS technology, gets a sattelite lock quite fast actually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It comes as no surprise that the only application you can rely on for navigation right out of the box is Google Maps. Its interface is slightly different from what we've seen before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick double-tapping can no longer be used for zooming in and out; instead, you should use the two virtual buttons at the bottom of the screen. These are hidden when not in use and only appear when you touch the screen. But despite the little changes, this is still the familiar Google Maps app we know and like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also sports Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of the Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation isn't possible using Google Maps. Still, there is some kind of navigation: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually... assuming you can read maps of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, there is a free app that allows turn-by-turn voice-guided navigation on the Galaxy and it's called AndNav2. The latter uses Google Maps, again, but adds some extra features that justify the download. AndNav2 uses the inbuilt digital compass and you no longer have to turn the handset to orientate the map to match your direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As mentioned, the AndNav2 app offers turn-by-turn navigation, which isn't bad at all. The voice-guided part, however, is questionable - to use it you need an extra, free app (Text-To-Speech Library) which supports English along with many other languages. Using text-to-speech engines instead of pre-recorded voices will give you a horrific computerized voice but the app is still helpful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're willing to pay for more, finally a full-featured SatNav solution was announced recently - Sygic Mobile Maps. It offers voice-guided navigation in more than 20 languages and comes complete with lane guidance, POI and even speed camera warnings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sygic Mobile Maps navigation software for Android</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price seems reasonable - 49.99 euro for UK and Ireland, 79.99 for entire Europe, 62.99 euro (that's 94 US dollars) for US, Canada and Mexico. There are no additional fees but it still seems a whole lot compared to free but still. Here's the product website if that got your interest.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks &amp; Modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've covered ways to mod your Android device by putting on custom firmware. You don't need to go that far with the Galaxy - there are already great apps to bring certain features: an HTC Sense-like homescreen or a better keyboard, to name a few.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One useful app is Open Home - Lite. It takes the place of the regular homescreen, but it's bigger - it has nine panes, three times as much as the regular one. It also throws in a shortcut to the search box, and a quick app launcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Best of all, there are a ton of skins for it - starting from iPhone skin, Palm Pre skin, and moving on to some more creative ones. It's not a complete redesign, just a skin, but it's a start (i.e. the menus still look like Androidish).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more to tweak even further - if you're not happy with the stock keyboard and envy HTC users - don't. You can install the exact same keyboard, complete with QWERTY, Compact QWERTY and Phone Keypad options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you need to do is download HTC_IME.apk and an app installer (we used SlideME App Installer). Put the .apk file on the memory card and then use the app installer to install it (remember to allow the use of "Unknown sources" in the phone's Application settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the installation has finished, from Locale &amp; text choose Touch Input. Then find a nice text input field (the browser works fine) and long press it. From the pop-up menu select "Input Method" and then choose Touch Input. That's it!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has what you need<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy comes with very little preinstalled applications - Google Maps, Google Talk, the Quickoffice, the PDF viewer and the YouTube client are all you get. However with the Android Market open for business you can find a large number of apps (a good portion of them is free by the way) which can be downloaded directly from the handset using Wi-Fi or the mobile network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch is the warning shown if the application you're about to download has potentially unsafe access to personal data, connectivity settings, etc. The warning says exactly what data will be accessed so you can abort the download if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When an app is being downloaded a status bar appears at the top of the display to track progress. When download is complete, you can start the application from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market follows the logic of the pioneering Apple App Store. Everything about it - the structure, the look - is pretty familiar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from pretty useless (such as the one that turns the display into a flashlight) to real must-have's (including file managers and video players).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, there we are at the restaurant at the end of the Galaxy. It's more of a sweet shop though and the next thing on the list of the specials will be donuts. But that won't be on the Samsung I7500 Galaxy shift. Enough fooling around though, it's time to tell the Galaxy there's no such thing as free lunch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy is a great phone running an OS of great potential but some of the limitations just can't go unnoticed. The 3.2" AMOLED capacitive touchscreen and 5-megapixel camera are nothing to sneeze at. But then, the Galaxy takes "point and shoot" to an extreme - there are practically no camera options. The top-notch connectivity and the great browser would've made it the ultimate choice for surfing the web on the go - was it not for the missing Flash support. The beautiful screen is just made for video watching, never mind the squarish aspect ratio. But there's no DivX or XviD video support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On other counts, the Galaxy takes full advantage of the ambitious OS. You can take the entire net with you and all the Google services. On top of that, Facebook and other things that don't come preinstalled have official apps that do the trick. And it doesn't have to all be cloud-based. You get 8GB of internal memory and a card slot for 16GB more - there's space for all the music you would want to take with you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy is Samsung's Android debut and some of its faults can be understood, if not forgiven. What's more, the competition is dealing with similar issues - they only have been doing it a bit longer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Hero is the Samsung I7500 Galaxy's archenemy. It offers more RAM, but no serious internal storage to speak of. The display is TFT only, and the HSUPA tops out at 2Mbps, but the Sense UI is certainly a treat ? especially with the latest software updates that speed up the performance noticably. The camera has much more settings and, as far as looks ? the white Teflon coated version is great. And yes, the Hero?s web-browser is Flash enabled and there?s Smart dialing on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Hero</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're not an Android fan but it's the specs that brought you around - have a look at the Samsung i8910 Omnia HD and the Palm Pre. The Omnia HD is more expensive but that gets you a bigger screen and a better camera. Plus, 720p video recording is still unbeaten. The Palm Pre on the other hand will try to please those who looked forward to Android as the Next Big Thing, but were left disappointed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung i8910 Omnia HD ? Palm Pre</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Magic isn't really that far behind the Hero, but the price tag is a lot easier to munch down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Acer Liquid. This thing promises to blow all current Android-based handsets away with its extra fast 768MHz Snapdragon CPU. It should start hitting the market within a month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC MagicAcer Liquid</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, in a nutshell - if the Android OS is eyeing the number 2 spot in smartphone market share by 2012, a leading manufacturer like Samsung will perhaps play a vital role in the plan. Therefore, the Galaxy must be as important to Samsung as Samsung is for the whole Android project. At this point, the Galaxy does well to show the company's commitment. It's a viable option too for users who want to stay loyal to the brand but give the new OS a try. It was the Sense UI and some other home-baked additions that took the HTC Android lineup a level up. We guess, Samsung are busy giving their next Android some more of their special in-house treatment as well.</paragraph>
