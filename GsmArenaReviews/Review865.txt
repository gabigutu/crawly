			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei has been a Top 3 smartphone maker two quarters in a row - and proud of it. The company is a leading 4G network equipment supplier and LTE connectivity is a prominent feature of the new devices Huawei brought to the MWC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The devices in question are a new Ascend smartphone, the G6, and two MediaPad tablets - the X1 and M1. Huawei needed a compact phone, but didn't want a mini, the result is the Ascend G6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the tablets, the MediaPad X1 is the most important device to be announced by Huawei today - it's a compact 7" tablet, with full voice call functionality. It uses the company's own HiSilicon 910 chipset and has specs that make it a clear rival of the Nexus 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad M1 is a bigger, 8" tablet, powered by the same chipset. It's a more affordable device overall, so the screen resolution and camera went down to midrange levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company also showed off its own wearable - the TalkBand B1. It's actually a Bluetooth headset that turns into a smartwatch thanks to the special wrist band. It's IP57-certified and has a built-in step and calorie counter, so it will compete with the various sports accessories with similar functionality. It does have the advantage of taking voice calls from your phone or MediaPad X1 tablet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend G6 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei unveiled the Ascend G6 - not the P7 as rumors suggested. The phone inherits the premium design of the Ascend P6, but is more affordable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend G6 measures 130 x 65mm, a few millimeters shorter and narrower than the P6. It's a little thicker, but still one of the thinnest phones around at just 7.5mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the G6 has a 4.5" LCD screen of qHD resolution (540 x 960, 245ppi). It runs Android 4.3 Jelly Bean on a HiSilicon chipset (quad-core processor at 1.2GHz with 1GB RAM). The phone has a 2,000mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has an 8MP / 720p camera on the back with an infrared filter, f/2.0 aperture and a Sony sensor. The 5MP front-facer comes with an 88° wide-angle lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend G6 will launch this quarter with 3G network support. Later on, Huawei is to release an LTE-enabled, slightly thicker version of the phone too. The LTE model will cost ?250, pricing for the 3G model is unclear at the moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accessories available for the handset include a Bluetooth headset, wireless speakers and a power pack.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Huawei MediaPad M1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad M1 is the bigger but lower-ranked Huawei tablet shown on the Mobile World Congress floor in Barcelona.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It sports an 8" 1280 x 800 display that's good for around 188 ppi. It sports a slim waistline at 7.9 mm and weighs a comfortable 329g. It's powered by a 4800mAh battery that Huawei says is good for 24 hours of browsing time. There's also reverse charging and you'll be able to charge your phone or other device off the tablet's battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 5MP primary camera and 1MP front-facer on the MediaPad M1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad M1 looks quite a lot like the HTC One with two micro-drilled speaker grilles mounted above and under the 8" screen, delivering DTS surround sound. The device is a mix of aluminum and plastic and feels quite sturdy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will be launching in May and is, at the time of writing, using a Huawei's Emotion UI OS on top of Android 4.2 Jelly Bean OS. A quad-core HiSilicon 1.6Ghz processor is doing the math.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface feels fluid and responsive. Weight-wise it's pretty balanced, neck and neck with Apple's iPad mini 2. Single-handed operation isn't very comfortable at this display size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price at launch will be ?299.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei MediaPad X1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad X1 is the pinnacle of the company's presentation on the MWC 2014. It is the most interesting device Huawei has brought to Barcelona and there is indeed a lot to discuss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the MediaPad X1 is a 7" slate, Huawei considers it as an all-in-one device and believes many users will be carrying and using it as a primary (and only) gadget. Yes, this means people will make calls on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first things first. Huawei MediaPad X1 is an incredibly slim tablet, in fact Huawei claims it is the world's thinnest 7" slate with its 7.18mm thickness. It is also smaller and lighter compared to the iPad mini and the latest Nexus 7 slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei MediaPad X1 packs a 7.0" IPS display of 1200x1920 pixels resolution (that's 323ppi). The screen-to-body ratio is 80%, which means incredibly thin screen bezels - just 2.99mm. The display is fully laminated and offers 515 nits brightness. Finally the 7" screen uses LTPS (Low Temperature Poly-Silicon) technology, which allows for more dynamic and rich colors, less battery consumption and better responsiveness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaPad X1 is powered by Huawei's newest HiSilicon Kirin 910 LTE-enabled (Cat.4) chip with a quad-core 1.8GHz Cortex-A9 processor, Mali-450 GPU and 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera department on the MediaPad X1 gives you a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP front one for high-res selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the MediaPad X1 packs the whopping 5,000mAh battery, which should provide you with 15 hours of web browsing, 125 hours of music playback, more than 8 hours of video streaming or more than 10 hours of video playback. The 5,000mAh can also be used as a portable battery - the MediaPad X1 is capable of reverse charging and could be used to charge another device. Nice!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the MediaPad X1 looks really beautiful. Since it is intended to be used as a primary device, you can notice the earpiece above the screen and the microphone at the bottom side of the slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side hosts nothing, while the right has the SIM and microSD beds plus the volume rocker and the Power/Lock key. The internal storage, by the way, is 16GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and bottom of the MediaPad X1 have the two microphones, the 3.5mm audio jack and the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Huawei MediaPad X1 is made almost entirely of metal. The 13MP camera accompanied by a LED flash is over the top plastic band, while the loudspeaker grille is at the bottom band.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei MediaPad X1 is indeed a very interesting device. It runs on Android Jelly Bean skinned with company's Emotion UI 2.0, but the final Android version wasn't specified at the announcement, so it might as well come with KitKat once it hit the shelves. The suggested retail price of the X1 is ?399.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei TalkBand B1 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Wearables are a hot ticket here at the MWC and Huawei brought its own - a smartwatch with a twist. The TalkBand B1 gets its name from being a Bluetooth headset that can be set into a rubber strap to be worn as a smartwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It features a 1.4" curved display and measures a little under 15mm thick. You can pair it with your phone - or MediaPad X1 tablet - over NFC, then Bluetooth 4.0 LE takes over to handle the audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TalkBand B1 justifies its sporty looks with IP57 certification, which should make it water-resistant enough for everyday use. Built-in step and calorie counters will help you train, with a sleep-quality indicator to help you rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, it does voice calls too as a regular Bluetooth headset when paired with a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery capacity is relatively low - 90mAh - but the device is power-efficient enough to last six days on a charge. What we found strange is that the battery can take up to two hours to charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of charging, that's done with the wrist band, which features a USB port and connects to the TalkBand unit with pogo pins. The clasp on the band could have been better though - it comes off too easily and is hard to put back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TalkBand B1 will cost ?100 upon launch - it will be out in China next month, with new locations to follow (including Western Europe and Japan) in Q2.</paragraph>
