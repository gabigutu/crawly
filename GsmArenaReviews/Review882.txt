			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We recently had the chance to get some hands-on time with Sony's new flagship in miniature, the Xperia Z1 Compact. The little fella packs flagship-grade specs into a much smaller footprint than most of today's premium smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The concept is nothing new really, with most top-tier manufacturers having downsized versions of their top flagships - the HTC One mini and Samsung Galaxy S4 mini being the most prominent in the bunch. But Sony hopes to get ahead of the pack with a supermini that has no less horsepower under the hood than the industry's top performers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's take a look at exactly what the Xperia Z1 Compact brings to the table:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1 Compact at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Z1 Compact has managed to retain not only the impressive Snapdragon 800 CPU, the 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of expandable storage, but also the Z1's 20.7MP shooter capable of 1080p video recording. You'll also find the same connectivity features, water resistance rating, and even a promised Android 4.4 KitKat upgrade. The only thing Sony didn't manage to bring over was the Full-HD screen resolution and 3000mAh battery (the Z1 Compact will have a 2300 mAh unit instead, the same as on the previous Xperia Z flagship).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has done well to deliver where many top manufacturers have more or less failed, by squeezing in the truly impressive specs of the Xperia Z1 flagship into a considerably smaller package with minimal sacrifices. Even the Compact moniker was carefully chosen, based on Sony's own case studies suggesting the "Mini" suffix carries overtones of inferiority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up next we've got more live photos of the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact, as well as our first impressions.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Just how compact is the Z1 Compact? The device weighs in at 140g - some 30 grams lighter than the Z1, and manages to shave off just over 9mm in width and 127mm in height. At 9.5mm, it is 1mm thicker than the Xperia Z1, likely due to them having to cram in a relatively large battery in such a small space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the few areas where the Z1 Compact differs from the Z1 is in display fidelity. Obviously, the Z1 compact has a smaller screen diagonal, but doesn't match the flagship's 1080p resolution either. Nevertheless, the 4.3-inch 720p IPS panel results in a more than acceptable pixel density of 341ppi, and features Sony's Triluminous display tech for some very sharp imagery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display lies the 2MP front-facing camera and the usual array of sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the design and layout of controls are exactly the same as on its elder brother. We were able to get our hands on both the black and white versions of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side you'll find the same pogo pin dock flanked by a microSIM, microSD, and USB card slots, while on the right is the familiar rounded power/lock button, a volume rocker, and a dedicated shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up top lies the 3.5mm headphone jack, while the bottom is bare save for a large loudspeaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back you'll find the lens of the same 20.7MP primary camera, LED flash on the side, covered by the stylish glass sheet that's been a staple of the Xperia line for the past several years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 Compact will premier in several color combinations, only a few of them seen in a Sony smartphone thus far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In-hand, the Z1 Compact is exactly what we imagined a miniature flagship from Sony would be. The great Xperia build quality has made its way here, while the smaller screen diagonal makes for easier one-handed use, as the thumb of your carrying hand is able to easily touch almost all areas of the screen. The compact size also makes for great pocketability, which is one of the biggest issues we have with most 5-inch, or bigger, smart devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony is planning to release its new Xperia Bluetooth headset - the SBH80 - alongside the Xperia Z1 Compact. It's set to hit retail at ?99.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>From a software standpoint, the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact will run Android 4.3 Jelly Bean out of the box - the same build that's on the Xperia Z1. Since the software on the Z1 Compact was not yet finalized for our hands-on, we weren't even allowed to snap screenshots of the interface, but we were told it will be identical to that of the Xperia Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite some kinks that need to be ironed out, the performance we experienced during our time with the Sony Xperia Z1 was flawless. The 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor with a robust GPU and 2GB of RAM have all the makings of a genuinely powerful compact device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z1 Compact is the first genuinely capable compact droid that doesn't require you to sacrifice the performance, display fidelity, and battery life found on high-end devices. We commend Sony for being the first manufacturer to respond to our petition for a high-end compact Android smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony is targeting a mid-February release for the Z1 Compact, with an expected price point lower than the Z1 flagship but higher than other compacts due to its premium specs. Sony has also assured us that the Z1 compact will be part of the first wave of Android 4.4 KitKat upgrades, set for "several weeks" after launch.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Better late than never. That's what T-Mobile and Sony must've thought when they decided to help the Sony Xperia Z1 swim across the ocean and hit the US carrier's domain. Dubbed, the Sony Xperia Z1S, the phone isn't too far off from its international brother and we're here at the showroom floor at CES 2014 to tell you what has changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the outside, Sony has kept the beautiful exterior of the Z1 and has made tiny alterations to the overall design. The Xperia Z1S is still built around the same 5" full HD TFT LCD display and packs the gorgeous glass-body of its surrogate. The water- and scratch-resistant capabilities remain intact as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The few changes made to the Z1S for T-Mobile include the presence of 32GB onboard memory instead of 16GB on the international model. The new model continues to have the microSD card slot, so no worries there. Additionally, the 3.5mm headphone jack on top has been moved to the center from the near the left side on T-Mobile's request.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the glass back of the Xperia Z1S, which now sports a T-Mobile logo at the bottom, sits a non-removable Li-Ion 3,000 mAh battery. We extensively tested the international model of the phone and deducted it can last up to 53 hours if you do an hour of movie watching, web browsing and calls a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Sony Xperia Z1S is powered by a 2.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 chipset with four Krait 400 cores, Adreno 330 GPU and 2GB of RAM. It packs plenty of oomph and runs Android 4.3 Jelly Bean perfectly well with KitKat planned some time down the road.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>T-Mobile offers its customers nice incentives to choose the Xperia Z1S. It comes with six free movie downloads from Video Unlimited, including Captain Phillips, on the day of its digital release, 10 handpicked PlayStationMobile games, and a 60-day free trial of Music Unlimited.</paragraph>
