			<paragraph>Nokia 3600 slide is one of those handsets which no one seems to covet, love and lust but everybody ends up buying or having. It's a straightforward guess that a S40 handset of subdued but comfortable styling and sufficient skill will simply go around. The neat and compact Nokia slider has all the basics duly covered and strives to deliver beyond its price in terms of imaging. A 3.2 megapixel camera, VGA video and TV out should be enough of an identity booster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Catering to the mid range is by no means an easy task. Affordability goes without saying, but you won't do without personality. How do you set your goods apart without ending up with a niche product? Plus, the midrange is a stretchy concept already. The limits are blurring over megapixel count, 3G and multimedia. Last but not least, yesterday's high-enders are getting cheaper, to make the utterly overcrowded midrange extra unfriendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are the kind of issues for Nokia 3600 slide to tackle and it chooses to do so by focusing on imaging. The 16M-color screen, 3 megapixel autofocus camera, VGA video and TV-out are the only goodies that are a bit too haughty for the midrange. The rest is plain and simple stuff that comes by the handful. The 200 euro package includes an audio player, FM radio, stereo Bluetooth, EDGE and expandable memory, all on the fit and reliable S40 platform. The smooth slider casing and neat looks round it all off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It does come out as a comprehensive feature set, but 3G would've really made it hard to resist. The 3600 slide still has enough to keep us busy, so let's get down to it. Unboxing and hardware inspection are this small jump away.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 3600 slide unboxed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Nokia 3600 slide is just average. The regular charger (not the mini variety), USB cable, and a set of stereo headphones are the things to find in the retail box. The 860 mAh battery is here as well, and a quick start guide and a manual complete the tally. The only bonus inside is the 512MB microSD card that ships with the handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 3600 slide 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 3600 slide measures 97.8 x 47.2 x 14.5 mm. Those numbers yell compact and the phone shape is perfect to fit in any pocket. The completely plastic body weighs 97.3 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The earpiece is centrally placed right above the Nokia logo and this is all you get above the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2" screen follows, with the huge soft keys right under it. It's an extremely pleasing navigation deck with ample and neat context keys and Call and End buttons placed on each side of a nicely elevated D-pad. All controls are very comfortable to use and accidental mispresses are completely ruled out. The navigation pad is strongly and evenly backlit. The same holds true for the display backlighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding up unveils the alphanumeric keypad, which takes the entire lower deck of the phone. The middle row of keys is framed by a thin metallic border reminiscent of the classic 6230 keypad styling. Keys are amply sized, well defined and solid to press. Mistypes are quite unlikely, and we are very happy with the build quality and the comfort of use. The only issue is the lack of headroom for the top row of keys, which is partly dealt with by the oval contour of the sliding bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad backlighting is also very strong and even to make the handset a pleasure to use in the dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top side of Nokia 3600 slide you'll find two apertures - a charger connector and a 2.5 mm audio jack. It seems 2.5 mm is the standard Nokia pick, leaving the 3.5 mm for the high-end multimedia devices only. Between the connectors is the power key, which also invokes ringing profiles upon a short press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset hosts the volume rocker and the dedicated camera key. Their size and elevation are great for touch orientation. A little grudge with the shutter key, which is very rigid to full press, though quite OK for a distinct and smooth half press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning to the left, we come upon only one essential element - the microUSB port, which is placed closest to the top, its plastic lid keeping the phone looks intact. The memory card slot is sadly nestled under the battery cover near the USB port. The mouthpiece and the lanyard eyelet are just above the USB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bottomside, we find only the battery cover latch, which is pretty rigid and requires quite some push to get the cover off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our shape-and-looks tour with the rear. The back panel is made of matt plastic, which is fingerprint-proof. The dual LED flash is right beside the lens and the whole combo is placed within a plate of finely brushed glossy plastic. In the bottom left corner is the loudspeaker grill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing the battery cover, which is easier said that done, reveals the BL-4S 860 mAh battery and the SIM compartment. The battery falls off just like that once the battery cover has been removed, as there is nothing to hold it down to its bed. Just the opposite, the SIM card compartment is caged under a metal bracket, which was a bit rigid at first too. The battery itself is a decent performer - the phone stuck out for 3 or 4 days on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The small slider is a pleasure to work with. The sliding action is smooth and solid, with a surprisingly short run. The modest, though by no means poor quality, casing is pleasant to the touch and quite reliable. The gradated color pattern and fingerprint resistant surfaces are an added gain.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nice 2-inch display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 3600 slide screen supports QVGA resolution and up to 16M colors on a 2" diagonal. A Nokia trademark, sunlight legibility is way beyond the reach of most other phones. The 2" diagonal might sound right for the price bracket, but we're talking a slider and a focus on imaging, so a 2.2" screen might not be too much to ask.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception and in-call sound are no concerns with Nokia 3600 slide. The handset is pitched for the so-called Background Noise Cancellation. The one thing that Nokia are missing to say though is that almost all current S40 phones also feature this noise cancellation feature called Voice Clarity. We even found that it performed better in removing the background noise with the Nokia 6500 classic. Anyway, sound is loud and clear on both ends and you will have zero trouble with your calls. Vibration strength in the 3600 slide is very good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out Nokia 3600 slide is a slightly-above-average performer. You are unlikely to miss a call but don't count on getting just everything in noisier environments. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: quick and slick<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 3600 employs the Series 40 5th edition user interface, FP 1. The number of configurable options has gone up but at the price of having somewhat complicated menu structure and navigation. The most serious advance with this version of the UI is the addition of the Nokia Maps applications, which works as good as the on on Nokia Symbian smartphones. It works flawlessly with an external Bluetooth GPS receiver so finding your way around is no problem now - even for a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no changes whatsoever to the stand-by screen of Nokia 3600 slide. The display features the pre-selected wallpaper with the usual status readings, such as signal strength, battery status, ringing profile icon and time in the top bar. The center of the navigation key opens the main menu, while the context keys can be assigned a function of your choice. The font on the main display can be of any color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode is available. It consists of four tabs that can be edited or relocated as users see fit. In the most common case, the top area is reserved for instant access to favorite functions denoted by their respective icons. The central area provides instant access to the music player, radio and calendar. At the very bottom the "Search Web" bar appears. Quite naturally, the two soft keys behavior can also be customized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icons themselves haven't been changed a jot, keeping the well known design with animation of the selected icon. They can also be freely reordered within the grid, should the user find their original order inconvenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Submenus appear as lists. As usual, alphanumeric keyboard shortcuts to menu items are enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is quick and responsive. There were freezes or unexpected restarts for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are six predefined ringing profiles on Nokia 3600. These should be enough to cover virtually any scenario. Flight mode is at hand too, turning off all transceivers and rendering the phone usable without a SIM card inserted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The background color of the entire menu, as well as the wallpaper, can also be easily modified by changing the active theme. There are four themes preinstalled on the Nokia 3600 but downloading new ones is only a matter of seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A superb phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Nokia 3600 slide stores up to 2000 contacts and that sounds more than enough. Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names eliminating problems, which may occur with synchronization. Ringtones can be assigned to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can also assign personal pictures or videos that will run on an incoming call. Caller image is different for incoming and outgoing calls. It fills the screen when you are on the receiving end of a call, and appears much smaller when you are calling one of your contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three available view modes for your contact list: Normal Name List, Name-and-Number and Name-and-Image. It can display the SIM card contacts, the phone memory contacts or both at the same time. Contacts can be ordered by either first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook font size can also be modified, should this be necessary, and it's an option that will surely be widely appreciated. And lastly, the well-known grouping is also present. This means that contacts can also be organized in groups and these can subsequently be used as call filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application to mention here is the voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary. There is also a Voice aid application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice new extra is the Find-on-Map option which locates the contact's address on the new Nokia Maps for S40 application if it is entered correctly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call Log in Nokia 3600 slide is the well-known S40 application. It can display Dialed, Received and Missed calls separately, as well as all of them in bulk. Every submenu can hold up to 20 call records with their date, time and duration.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging duly covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual, the messaging department is very good, but does not offer any significant changes. Not that it needs any, as it's organized very well and capabilities are extensive. Nokia 3600 slide is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email, as well as flash and audio messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS use one and the same editor and all you need to do to turn a regular SMS into MMS is insert some kind of multimedia content. As soon as you activate the editor, it displays a field for entering the number of the recipient, which you can fill by simple typing, select it from the phonebook, from the caller groups, or from the list with the most recent addressees in the call register. There is even the very handy option to define a favorite message contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything in the editor is intuitive and organized in a practical time-saving manner. Once you have inserted the relevant number, a single click will shift to the message body where you can start typing. The T9 dictionary and the handy delivery reports go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message length is limited to 1000 characters with both the count of typed characters and the number of parts the message will break down into displayed on the screen. All messages use the shared memory, regardless of their type. A photo, a contact card, or an event from the calendar can be sent via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio messages have a separate editor, which can either record the message on the fly or use a previously recorded sound clip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is doing pretty well to meet most user needs in this aspect. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which makes it possible to be synced with Gmail mailbox for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When a message is to be sent, it finds the email address of the corresponding recipient in the phonebook. Sent attachments are not limited in size. Either message headers only or entire messages can be downloaded by default, depending on your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under messaging the Yahoo!Go feature is also available, a third-party service provided by Yahoo! Inc. The convenient service is optimized for small-screen browsing on handsets and gives access to yahoo mail, calendar, and weather, along with stocks, news, blogs, mobile search, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player is well known<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Without doubt, the music player is among the nice applications of Nokia 3600 slide. It has decent looks and all-round functionality, including album art and a good number of formats supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player is controlled with the D-pad. Besides all the typical functions, the music player of Nokia 3600 also sorts songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, MP4, WMA, AMR-NB, Mobile XMF, SP-MIDI, MIDI Tones (64-tone poly) and True tones. Naturally A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player has one extra skin on top of the default. It's called Charcoal and we did like it. The currently playing tracks are displayed on the active home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't like the headset that ships with the phone, you can easily replace it thanks to the 2.5mm standard jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the player, we have to say it offers a large number of configurable options. The sonic experience gets enhanced by equalizer presets and stereo widening. There are 5 equalizer presets on Nokia 3600 but you can easily create new ones thanks to the two user defined slots available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quaity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Even though it is not a music phone, Nokia 3600 slide has a rather good frequency response. The rest of the readings in our audio quality test weren't as impressive but there is nothing too disturbing about them either. Still, we have to amit that most of them are slightly below average. Given the realitively low price tag of the device and the fact that we've seen Nokia do far worse, we would call the audio quality of Nokia 3600 slide decent. Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio fortunately has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative for the preloaded content on your Nokia 3600 slide is the FM radio. It uses the audio player interface and covers all basic functions. Much like the music player, the FM radio also has two different themes to pick from. RDS support is available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player of Nokia 3600 slide is compatible with 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, as well as fast-forwarded or rewound. The option to hide soft key captions to make better use of the full screen mode also improves the viewing experience. Of course, much like the FM radio and audio player, the player works in the background appearing on the active standby tab.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is not impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's nothing about the image gallery of Nokia 3600 slide we haven't seen in the midrange bar 3120 classic. Pity, as we aren't really in love with the looks of the S40 gallery. The fact that it is an inherent part of the file manager is probably the main cause of disappointment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three different views for the gallery: list with details, list and grid. Once you pick a picture you can zoom on it to see more detail. Zooming itself is not the fastest (especially for larger pictures) and the most capable around, so it is practically of little use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures can also be viewed fullscreen and can be edited with the built-in picture editor. The latter offers a very limited number of options (as a contrast to almost every Samsung phone with a bunch of editing features), so Nokia 3600 slide users are highly unlikely to take up photo editing on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final extras of the gallery include the available Slideshow and Search option, which is quite convenient for finding a specific file in overfed folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole we aren't really pleased with the S40 gallery and we do hope that it will be one of the first things to improve in the future versions of the UI.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3.2 megapixel camera with autofocus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Imaging is supposed to be the highlight of Nokia 3600 slide. What we have here is the most affordable 3 megapixel package of the house to date. The handset is armed with a 3.2 megapixel camera with image resolution of up to 2048 x 1536 pixels. Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited but - after all - reasonable given the mid-range shooter. The available settings include white balance, three quality levels going form basic to high, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.2 MP autofocus camera may be a tad above midrange but the LED flash is rather weak, usable with close range objects only. The dedicated camera key is a welcome perk, but the hard full press ruins part of the pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3600 slide camera is hardly among the top 3.2 megapixel shooters. Image quality is about average; in favorable weather decent images can be produced, a bit oversharpend, but with good color rendering. Noise levels still remain high in areas of uniform coloring. The lack of detail in images is another weakness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera speed isn't remarkable and saving files is on average too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as video recording is concerned, Nokia 3600 slide manages VGA resolution at 15 fps. The 3GP video clips length is only limited by the memory available. Although video quality is far from stunning, the VGA resolution is still rare enough across the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a Nokia 3600 slide sample video shot at VGA resolution (15 fps).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The mid-range Nokia 3600 slide connectivity options are quite OK. The seamless USB connectivity leads the lot. Once the USB cable is plugged, you're prompted to select the connection mode. You can then alternate the modes by only a few key presses. Moreover, Mass storage is available, allowing your phone's memory to be directly accessed from a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As mentioned, the A2DP profile of the Bluetooth is supported to allow a stereo wireless connection. The rest of the connectivity options include the network support - sadly Nokia 3600 slide does not support 3G, but EDGE and GPRS are both the best there is at Class 32.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the memory card slot, which can sometimes be the most convenient way of transferring data, is also present here. The microSD slot is placed under the battery cover.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 3600 slide has an integrated HTML web browser. No significant changes in functionality have been made to the S40 browser since the previous edition of the user interface. Therefore you shouldn't be surprised that it is not the best on the market, lacking a lot of the skills of the more advanced alternatives. It still offers decent page rendering and font size customization. When set at the smallest font, up to 11 text lines are displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Luckily, the phone is also equipped with an alternative web browser. The Opera Mini is located in the application section and is really the better browsing choice on the 3600 slide. It is far more intuitive and fits text better than the integrated browser. The overall browsing capabilities of Nokia 3600 can hardly be compared to the best on the market but it's still a decent offering considering the price range.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer good as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of Nokia 3600 slide is truly elaborate, offering a large number of time management applications with nice features and user-friendly interface. The calendar offers month, week, and day modes and five types of events available for setting up. The week can start on Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. The event types are: reminder, meeting, call, birthday and memo. Further, each type of event has its own specific fields and some of them even allow an alarm to be set up as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next-in-line is the handy To Do manager that enables you to categorize tasks in three priority levels. Tasks can be alerted of, as well as marked off once accomplished. Those can also be easily synchronized with the calendar application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text notes are available as well - their length is limited to 3000 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable; it can be set to go off on any weekday and works even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia 3600 slide calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition a loan calculator is also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 3600 slide comes with a good number of preinstalled applications outside the organizer too. The consistently useful unit convertor is first in the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with enough information about the rates, offers currency conversion too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Download! application follows, which directly connects to the Nokia download center, where you can find a lot of downloadable content for you phone, most of it free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Search application is a built-in Yahoo! Search piece of software. After setting the country or region you can conduct web search for images and other information. The 20 most relevant search results are returned to your phone upon request. Find out more about the Search at nokia.com</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Sensor application is a Bluetooth-based tool for detecting other users in the vicinity and sharing information with them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Size convertor is another practical application. It makes approximate conversions between various international clothing sizes. You can also save several user profiles for size details in the size log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia WidSets are mini applications, which brings favorite web content to your mobile phone for free. The Java based service is offered by Widsets.com and it can work on every regular Java phone as well. Among the most popular widgets are the mobile versions of YouTube, Flickr, Ebay, Wikipedia, IMDb, and various weather forecast and news services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final featured application is World clock for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps for S40<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps has finally arrived on select S40 devices and the Nokia 3600 slide is among the first handsets to feature it. Among the things you can do without a GPS receiver is browse maps, look up addresses and locations, and plan routes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Map Loader application for PC you can download map data to a compatible computer, and transfer it to your device to save on data charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps offers straightforward route planning. Having entered a start point and a destination, the application will plan your route with easy-to-follow directions to where you're heading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you pair the phone with a Bluetooth GPS unit, it turns into a full-fledged navigation decice. Furthermore, turn-by-turn visual and voice guidance are available upon purchasing a navigation license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Putting down some Landmarks while you're on the go, or saving locations in the Favorites section is another available option. Favorites contents can also be exported/sent via MMS, which is a nice extra too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Let the games begin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Gaming lovers will probably appreciate the preinstalled content on Nokia 3600 slide: there are as many as six featured titles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Classic board game fans will be glad to find Backgammon II. It is a nice Java interpretation of the popular game. Snake is essential to Nokia phones, its presence in Nokia 3600 slide is barely a surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next two games in line are the sport simulation Golf Tour and the Java version of the popular Japanese game Sudoku. All the games have decent graphics and are comparatively easy to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The City Bloxx game is a challenge to both the brain and reflexes. Your goal is to create a city by stacking tower blocks on top of each other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music Guess tests your ability to recognize songs by listening to small parts of them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It sometimes seems lowish-end handsets are unjustly held to a higher standard by being expected to do just more than look and act their price. The neat and comfortable 3600 slide won't stun or surprise but you can count on reasonable performance. The smooth exterior can be quite a motivation to explore and ultimately appreciate quite a rewarding feature set: 16M-color QVGA screen, FM radio, stereo Bluetooth, memory expansion and Nokia Maps. The 3.2 megapixel camera is clearly unimpressive, especially given the high stakes on imaging, but TV-out and VGA video might make it easier to swallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's obvious that in this price range you can't have it all, so not much point in lamenting 3G. The 6600 slide will shut you up anyway.</paragraph>
