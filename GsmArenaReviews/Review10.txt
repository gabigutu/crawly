			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Navigation on a feature phone, are they for real? Obviously Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is keen to surprise. It?s among the rather few feature phones that come with free full-featured navigation. It even has all the cool accessories to make it feel right at home in your vehicle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s rare to see a dedicated SatNav phone but that doesn?t mean we?ll let the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition pass lightly in other departments. It still has to prove it deserves your hard earned cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clearly, there are some features missing from that specs sheet. The Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition doesn't have a nice camera and the display could have been larger and of better quality. We totally get that - it's positioned quite low in the product portfolio. Still, some of the omissions that are inherent to S40 such as the lack of a document viewer or smart dialing - competition have had those covered for a long time on various models. There's no excuse for Nokia and their S40 on skimping on such simple features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But on the positive side, you get a regular no-nonsense handset with nice and conservative styling, solid battery life and excellent build quality. You also won?t be breaking the bank buying it and you can count on its enhanced location-awareness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s start with a look at its design and construction. Follow us on the next page to see the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition package exposed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>We like the retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Recent Nokia phones come in quite compact boxes but the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is an exception. The reason? A smaller package wouldn?t have been able to accommodate all the standard accessories the phone comes with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the handset you get a compact charger, a tiny USB-to-microUSB data cable, some paperwork and the cheap one-piece stereo headset we see bundled with most of Nokia?s recent phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of that (or underneath it actually) you?ll also find the enclosed in-car holder and charger. That, combined with 2710 Navigation Edition?s free walk-and-drive navigation license, turns the device into a capable GPS navigation solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And in the phone?s card slot there was a 2GB microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-car holder works fine. It is easy to attach and detach from the windscreen. You have to press the suction cup against the windscreen and rotate the ring clockwise. Once you?ve placed the phone in the holder, you can be sure it?s in ?safe hands?. An optional pad would allow you to stick the holder directly to the dashboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition measures 111.2 x 45.7 x 13.7 mm with a volume of 60.4 cc ? more or less the same size as the other models in the 27XX lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone hits the sweetspot of comfortable handling. Neither too small, nor too big - it fits nicely into any pocket but it?s not too small to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Due to the lack of any outer metal elements the weight is kept well down to only 87 grams. The build quality is ok, 2710 feels solid enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is cute and feels nice when held in hand. There is nothing special about its design ? it?s more on the conservative side really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device is available in three color versions: Jet Black, Warm Silver, and White Silver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition comes with a 2.2" 256K-color QVGA display. And if it wasn?t for the ?Navigation? moniker we wouldn?t say a word against it in this price range. When navigation is involved however we like our screens big and bright with wide viewing angles and good sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hardly find any 2.2-inch unit suitable for in-car navigation. We reckon the bare comfort minimum for that is a diagonal of at least 2.6 inches. Even an extra 0.2 inches would?ve improved the user experience dramatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while sunlight legibility with the Nokia 2710 is fine, we can?t pass on the poor viewing angles. We?ve seen S40 devices do way better than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuing our roundtrip of the Nokia 2710 externals, each of the rocker-styled buttons beneath the display accommodates one soft key and one call key. The navigation frame of the D-pad projects nicely over a roomy confirm key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side of the D-pad there is one more knob ? the Maps button, which starts the Nokia Maps application. All controls are comfortable to use and occasional mispresses are very rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display backlighting and the white keypad illumination are very strong. However, in typical S40 style, there?s no option to set the brightness manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top side of Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition hosts the lanyard eyelet, the charger plug and the 3.5mm audio jack ready to accommodate your pair of standard headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the 2710 we find the microSD card slot and the microUSB port right above it. Both feature protective lids to keep away dirt and dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has no problem handling a 16GB microSD cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side only features a camera key made of cheapo plastics with faux metallic finish. Well, at least it?s comfy though. Quite unusually, there are not volume keys on any of the sides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can conclude this part of the 2710 Navigation Edition review with the back panel, which is quite reminiscent of the one of Nokia 6700 classic. This is where you find the 2-megapixel fixed-focus camera and the loudspeaker. One complaint we have here is that sound does get muffled when the phone is lying on a flat surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Releasing the battery cover (by sliding it downwards) reveals the capable Li-Ion 1020 mAh (BL-5C) battery. The Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition charges through the standard charger plug but not through the microUSB port (unlike many competitors).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition wasn?t with us for long, but in the two days of use following the intensive reviewing routine the battery didn?t budge, it still read full. We made about 10 minutes of phone calls, about half an hour of shooting photos, then music and games (about 15 min each) and then there was quite a bit of general prodding of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This power efficiency makes the 2710 a very reliable handset ? it?ll run for days on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM card compartment is housed under a hinged metal bracket and swapping it is a quick and easy job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the 2710 Navigation Edition is all-plastic, it feels quite solid when held in hand. The phone handles nicely and navigation around the UI is quite straightforward. Fingerprints are not a problem at all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface is customizable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition uses the S40 user interface ? given its low standing in the both price and numbering scheme, that?s hardly surprising. This doesn?t get in the way of the device?s primary features though ? in fact, it makes them easier to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2710 Navigation Edition runs the latest available Nokia feature phone software ? S40 6th edition. It has received a number of upgrades from the previous versions. The two major functions of the phone ? telephony and navigation ? are easily accessible from the homescreen and the Active Standby offers very good flexibility for a non-touch homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen of the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition features the pre-selected wallpaper with the usual status readings, such as signal strength, battery status, ringing profile icon and time occupying the top part of the screen. The fonts are large and easy to see through the whole interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby mode (or Home screen mode, as Nokia call it here) is the default homescreen. It consists of four sections that can be edited or relocated as users see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Out of the box, the top section (which is not editable) holds the clock with letters so large that a quick glance is enough to check the time. At the bottom of the screen there?s a shortcut bar, which grants instant access to favorite functions and applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu seems to follow the same easy-on-the-eyes concept with its several available view modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S40 lacks multitasking and we doubt that this will ever change ? but there are things in place that handle the most common functions without the need for multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Contacts for example, lets you stay online even when you exit the app. You will be notified of new messages, and if you pin the Contacts tab on your homescreen, you?ll even be able to read the messages without launching the app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even Nokia Maps has the option to make a call or send a message during navigation ? no need to exit the app to do that. We?ve seen proper smartphones that can?t do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, you can feel the lack of multitasking and another long-standing problem of S40 ? the lack of a document viewer. For its simplicity, the UI is fast and easy to use, which holds some appeal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned the nice big clock on the homescreen, but there are two other ways to check the time. Thanks to the built-in accelerometer, there?s the tap-for-time ? a double tap on the phone brings up an analog or digital clock (you can pick which), or you could press the End key while the phone is locked to get the same result.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is decent, knows people?s addresses<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition stores up to 2000 contacts ? it?s not unlimited storage, but the majority of users will never run out of room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can be assigned a variety of fields but the phone numbers are limited to 5. First names are separated from last names, eliminating problems which may occur with synchronization. Custom ringtones can be assigned to each contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice extra in tune with the navigating spirit of the Nokia 2710 is the Find-on-Map option which locates the contact's address on the Ovi Maps for S40 application if it is entered correctly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception and in-call sound cause no concerns with the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition. It lacks the Voice Clarity enhancement, which is a common feature on S40 phones but it?s not that badly missed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sound is loud and clear on both ends and we had zero trouble with our calls. Vibration strength is pretty decent too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An application to mention here is the voice dial: no pre-recording of voice labels is necessary as it is fully speaker independent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has not included any Smart dialing features though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We carried out our traditional loudspeaker test to find out Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is a Good performer. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Passable messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging on the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is as good as it gets on a phone relying on a 12-key alphanumeric keypad. The phone is capable of handling all the common message types including SMS, MMS and email, as well as flash and audio messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typing a SMS/MMS message is a nice experience with the Nokia 2710 and its keypad. T9 is available to speed up typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor is well enough organized and you won?t need much time to find your way around it. In the recipient field a few letters of someone?s name are enough ? you can quickly pick the desired contact from the automatically offered list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client does pretty well to meet most user needs. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports multiple email accounts. The email client supports SSL, which enables it to handle a Gmail account for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up the email client was extremely easy. All the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition needs is your email address and password and it will take care of techy stuff like server addresses and ports.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is at file managing, not so much at being a gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We never quite liked the S40 gallery and despite some freshening up in the 6th edition, it?s still not a favorite. Don?t get us wrong, it does all the stuff a gallery should do and it?s an excellent file manager. But a gallery should focus on attractive presentation an ease of browsing, and it?s here that the S40 gallery trails behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app on the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition offers only a single view mode, displaying a grid of 12 pictures on the screen. At least zooming in on a single picture is pretty comfortable now with the zoom in and out shortcuts placed on the middle and right soft keys. It?s also faster and smoother than we are used to seeing from most of its predecessors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Nokia 2710 has decent looks and a good feature set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can sort songs by artist, album and genre. The player works with AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, WMA, AMR-NB. Naturally A2DP profile is supported, allowing the use of stereo Bluetooth earphones. There are preset equalizers settings available and you can customize another two, plus there?s Stereo widening available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the artist and title of the currently playing song are shown on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of volume keys is inconvenient - it means that you have to have the music player active to change the volume.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>An alternative to the preloaded content on Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is the FM radio. It matches the music player interface and covers all basic functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS support is available and you can get the handset search and save all available stations in your area. RDS info and frequency appear on the homescreen, much like with the music player. There?s also a station directory, which pulls data from the Internet about local radio stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is hardly worth it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let?s make this clear ? the Nokia 2710 is by no means a device that should be considered by anyone who is serious about watching videos on their mobile. The combination of a small screen, a low number of supported codecs and a less than fully-featured video player hardly creates the ideal conditions for pleasurable viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of Nokia 2710 is only compatible with 3GP and MP4 formats. Videos can be played in fullscreen mode, fast-forwarded or rewound and that?s that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is top-notch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite its low-end non-music-dedicated nature, the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition delivers great audio output. It might not blow your mind away with loudness when headphones are attached but all the songs will sound exactly the way they were meant to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the readings in our traditional test are excellent. Starting with the spot-on frequency response and ending with the great signal-to-noise ratio there is nothing bad we can say about the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while the main purpose of the phone is to replace your dedicated SatNav system, the Nokia 2710 is also capable of covering up for your mp3 player. And quite well at that. Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera is an unimpressive 2MP shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition packs a minimal 2MP fixed focus-camera. It snaps photos at 1600x1200 pixels resolution and we wouldn?t use them unless we really had no other option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical Series 40, the camera settings are rather limited but reasonable given the mid-range spot. The available settings include white balance, resolution, and various effects. Sequence shots and shooting in both portrait and landscape mode are also among the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly, the image quality is poor. Images are quite noisy, not that 2 megapixels are enough to capture any fine detail. After snapping a shot, the camera takes a few seconds before it?s ready for another shot. All in all, you could probably use it for contact photos or general note taking but not much more than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording: why did they bother?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is rather unimpressive in video capture too ? it manages QVGA@15fps, which is not surprising for a 2-series phone. We guess that sort of video is only good for an occasional MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a sample video, just for thoroughness? sake.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity is low-end, but the GPS receiver is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is hardly a connectivity master. It offers quad-band GSM/EDGE connectivity and Bluetooth ? nothing that can?t be found on just about every phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there are some positive aspects as well ? the 2710 Navigation Edition has the standard 3.5mm audio jack and a hot-swappable microSD card. This scores some points for the connectivity, but the lack of USB charging is annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, as its name suggests the Nokia 2710 stakes a lot on the built-in GPS receiver as its main feature. We?ll cover its performance in the Ovi Maps section of the review. But as a spoiler ? it?s quite good.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Opera Mini is the browser of choice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The default browser on the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is Opera Mini 4.2. It?s a tradition for S40 phones, but there?s a new version available, which offers some new goodies ? such as multiple tabs, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way Mini works is the page is rendered on Opera's servers and sent into a lighter format to the device, with the images compressed. While this somewhat spoils the quality, on a small screen (as most low-power devices that rely on the Mini have) you can't tell the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference in image quality aside, the compression really saves on data charges. For example, GSMArena.com clocks in at about 370KB through Nokia?s S40 browser and just under 70KB through Opera Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This saves on data and more importantly speeds things up ? the Nokia 2710 relies on EDGE, so having to download much less data means faster browsing. Opera?s rendering algorithm is very good and there are very rarely any problems with mis-rendered pages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer of the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is very elaborate, offering a large number of time management applications with nice features and a user-friendly interface. The calendar offers month, week, and day modes and five types of events can be set up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is repeatable: it can be set to go off on any selected days of the week, even when the phone is switched off. You can also customize the snooze time if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing functions available include a voice recorder with a 60-minute limit, a stopwatch and a countdown timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 2710 calculator offers two versions - basic and advanced. In addition a loan calculator is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The consistently useful unit converter is first in the list of additional applications. It offers all kinds of converting options and, if provided with info on current exchange rates, it offers currency conversion too. There's an additional converter that gives you clothing and shoe size equivalents worldwide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final featured application is World clock for checking the time in any time zone at the cost of only a few clicks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ovi integration ? Store, Contacts and Share<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ovi Store on S40 works much like on S60 smartphones. Browsing the Ovi Store, you can choose between several sections - Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization, Recommended and of course, My Stuff, which shows you the apps you've already installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Ovi Store client is simple - a list with the name and logo for each app (or podcast, or whatever), the category it's in (Entertainment, Utilities, etc), price and a three star rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Contacts goes about giving you access to one of the Internet's most time-wasting services - instant messaging. Ovi Contacts integrates tightly with the phonebook (as a new tab) and offers an IM client with a twist. You can search for people already registered with Ovi or send an invitation to anybody using Gmail since the Ovi contacts supports G-Talk, Google's own IM, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to this service you will be able to chat in real time with all your Ovi/Google Talk-connected contacts, change your status messages and mood, and all that kind of social networking stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition you can share the name and the artist of the track you are currently listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is fine and dandy but here's the stumbling block - S40 doesn't offer multitasking. Still, you can remain online and receive messages even without the app running in the foreground.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is where the homescreen comes in ? once you put the Contacts bar on your homescreen, it will show you the number of your friends online and even a message when you receive one, complete with sound notifications. If the Contacts bar is not on the homescreen, a notification pops up instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either way, choosing to reply starts the Contacts app. It?s slow and a little annoying, but it?s nice that you can always stay online ? in a somewhat clumsy way, the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is part of the social crowd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are into sharing images, video and audio files with your buddies straight from your handset have a look at Ovi Share. After a quick sign-up process, selecting files for uploading is easy enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This app is limited, you can only browse your and your friends' uploads. For general browsing you'd need a web browser (the Opera Mini can take care of that). Bear in mind that even 2 megapixel photos can cost you quite a bit at the end of the month if you're not on an unlimited data plan.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Maps for S40 is like Ovi Maps redux<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a car stand and car charger in the box, not to mention the dedicated Maps button, you know this feature phone means business when it comes to GPS navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition comes with a life-time license for Nokia Maps 2.1, which is what Ovi Maps was called before the Ovi rebrand. For some reason, Nokia decided to keep the Nokia Maps name for the S40 platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of hardware, we?re pleased with the Nokia 2710 ? the GPS receiver got a lock in less than a minute and a half from a cold start (A-GPS can greatly speed this process up) and there?s even a digital compass, which enables auto map rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This works for looking around the map - it's handy because it rotates the map so that you can easily see what's in front of you. When you start the voice-guided car navigation however, the map is rotated according to the direction on the street you're currently on. To enable the compass, you need to calibrate it first - which requires you to twirl the phone around for a while until the compass gets its bearings. This has to be done each and every time you want to use this feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there?s no option for screen rotation in the Maps app ? not even manual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition came with no preloaded maps, but with the Map Loader application for PC you can download map data to a compatible computer, and transfer it to your device to save on data charges, all for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the option to download the maps over the air as you go, but you?d need a solid data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps offers straightforward route planning. Once you enter a start point and a destination, the application will plan your route with easy-to-follow directions to where you're heading ? be it by car or on foot. Calculating a route is quite fast, despite the Nokia 2710 not being a highly-powered smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view points of interest, set it to avoid toll roads, bridges and others along with other fine tuning options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download voice instructions in a variety of languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Saving locations in the Favorites section is another available option. The contents of Favorites can have different icons and can also be exported/sent via MMS, which is a nice extra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a ?Send location? option, which takes a screenshot of the map and your location and creates an MMS message with the image and the name of the selected location ? this greatly simplifies sharing your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick links is a feature that we really appreciate ? in short, it?s a way around the lack of multitasking. It has three options ? call, create message and inbox. They do what they say ? being able to make a call or check a new message during navigation almost makes us not miss the lack of multitasking. Almost.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Three games to pass the time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are several games preinstalled on the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition and they are diverse enough to help most people kill a bit of time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rally 3D is pretty much what it says. It?s good to see a car-oriented game on the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Block?d is a version of the popular Bubble Breaker game ? you have to ?pop? groups of squares of the same color. The bigger the group, the more points you earn.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And in the end is a Sudoku puzzle game. If you're a Sudoku buff, this may very well be the most time-consuming feature on the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition is a somewhat low-end Nokia S40 phone, for all the good and bad that entails. However, the GPS receiver and navigation software as well as the well-stuffed retail package mean good bang for your buck, which is a big plus in its favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all people need their phone to have access to tens of thousands applications ? calling, messaging and music player is enough for many. The allure here is that the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition can replace a dedicated SatNav unit which costs as much (or even more) than it does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part about the 2710 Navigation Edition is that it?s ready to go right out of the box. There?s an easy-to-use car stand and a car charger and while our unit didn?t have any maps preinstalled, yours should at least come with your regional map preinstalled. If not, the Map Uploader app will set you up with all the maps you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As good as it is in navigation, in the end of the day the Nokia 2710 is still a low-end S40 phone. Other, more capable phones can easily take its place and for not much more money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any Symbian-powered phone from Nokia with built-in GPS would do ? Ovi Maps for Symbian comes with a free navigation license as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Nokia C5, for example, costs a bit more, but it?s proper mid-range Symbian smartphone with metal used here and there, not to mention the zippy 600MHz CPU. You get the same screen, slightly better camera, 3G and you get to keep the 2GB microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia C5 ? Nokia 5230</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 5230 is another alternative. It has a 3.2? nHD screen, which offer noticeably better resolution and screen real estate than the 2710 Navigation Edition. It has a 2MP camera but it manages to squeeze out VGA@30fps video, which is not a bad achievement at all. It comes without a microSD card, which you?ll need to download the mapps, but if you don?t have one already, they are already dirt cheap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What is more Nokia is currently running a promotion, offering a free car stand for Nokia 5230, Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, Nokia E52 and Nokia E72. A free car stand and a car charger comes with Nokia X6, Nokia N97, Nokia N97 mini and Nokia 6710 Navigator. All these are Symbian phones with GPS ? so they offer free navigation with Ovi Maps. The promotion is not available in all countries and Nokia?s website says the offer is for a limited time only (no end date is listed though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But still, at the time of this writing (early June), on some markets the Nokia 5230 goes for less than the 2710 Navigation Edition in the UK. Granted it doesn?t have a car-charger, but you can get one on the cheap. With its current price tag, it?s very hard to recommend buying the Nokia 2710 Navigation Edition over Nokia?s own 5230 unless of course you?re absolutely scared of touch phones. Moving the 2730 down a notch to a more competitive price point would certainly help for the success of this sturdy little fella that always seems to know its way around.</paragraph>
