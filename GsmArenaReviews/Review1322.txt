		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Someone has just finished off a six-pack of energy drinks. The Samsung Galaxy S plus is nearly identical to the original Galaxy S, save for the different chipset, which packs a faster 1.4GHz processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's bespoke Hummingbird chipset has been swapped out for Qualcomm MSM8255T Snapdragon. The "T" means it's a faster version of the vanilla MSM8255 chipset found in a good deal of Android phones. With a clock speed of 1.4GHz, it could be up to 40% faster. We'll see how they measure up though, as they have slightly different architectures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Qualcomm's chipset comes with Adreno 205 graphics instead of the custom PowerVR SGX540 in the original Galaxy S. We expect a slight difference in graphics performance too. Also, the new battery can hold up to 10% of extra juice, for a total of 1650 mAh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that however, you can't tell the Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy S Plus apart - not even with a caliper and scales. Here's a summary of what the S Plus has to offer, complete with a feeling of deja vu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were quite pleased with the original Galaxy S, but the bar has been raised beyond reach by the new super flagship, the Galaxy S II. The Galaxy S Plus is a new and improved edition but one that will hardly make a big splash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's still a phone that can make a solid impression though. The 4" SuperAMOLED screen with WVGA resolution is a great performer to this day and at 9.9mm of thickness, the S Plus is a proud member of the sub-centimeter club.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already seen the Samsung Galaxy S Plus in action. An early premarket sample, running at just 1.2GHz, showed promising results as an alternative to dual-cores this year. If you're curious, you can check out the article here, but we'll be running the benchmarks and other tests anew anyway, so you may just read on as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flip to the next page where we'll look at the Galaxy S plus from all sides. If that doesn't make your heads spin, maybe trying to tell the difference between the new guy and the original Galaxy S will. After that, it's TouchWiz-glazed Gingerbread and a round of benchmarks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Plus has the exact same friendly measurements of the original, in both size and weight. At 9.9mm thick and 119g of weight, the S Plus can still be considered compact even by today's standards.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Opening the standard box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Plus suffix hasn?t brought anything extra to the bundle. There's the mini-sized charger, a microUSB cable and a nice looking, one-piece headset with a single button remote.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It should be noted that the Galaxy S Plus comes with 8GB of built-in memory, so not having a microSD card in the box is not a problem.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We imagine someone at Samsung took the blueprints for the I9000 Galaxy S, scratched out "Hummingbird chipset", wrote "Qualcomm MSM8255T" over it and handed it in as the I9001 Galaxy S Plus draft.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It takes a trained eye to tell the two apart. The silver strip around the phone's face has a lighter color in the Samsung Galaxy S Plus than in the original version and the pattern on the back is slightly different (less conspicuous, and perhaps more mature). Oh, and the "with Google" label is now gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that the Galaxy S and S Plus are not attractive gadgets, they are, but the design is already a year old. Also, there's no obvious way for others to tell that you have the newer, better model and not the old one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone uses the same SuperAMOLED WVGA (800 x 480) display as the original. You get to enjoy excellent image quality and viewing angles on a 4? diagonal. The downside is it?s based on the old PenTile matrix with fewer subpixels than the updated SuperAMOLED Plus screens. But guess what, it?s still good enough by our books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s still a SAMOLED unit we?re talking about here, so the contrast ratio is theoretically infinite. This achievable in practice only in dark rooms, otherwise reflections from external light sources get in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the brightness is above average though not as bright as some LCDs or the AMOLED screen on the Nokia X7. The results were almost identical to the original Galaxy S readings, with a difference of just a few nits. This is probably due to slight software differences in adjusting screen brightness and on top of a reasonable margin of error. If you put down the sciency measuring tools though, the two screens are virtually indistinguishable in all aspects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a table of the brightness levels of several mobile phone screens we've tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display is the obligatory earpiece and a front-facing VGA camera. There're proximity and ambient light sensors here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are three Android keys - the hardware Home key, flanked by the touch-sensitive Menu and Back keys, which are backlit in white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout of controls is the same as in the original too. The Power/Lock button is on the right-hand side. It's small but protrudes, so it's easier to press, and its position makes it comfortable to reach in both right and left hand use. Accidental presses are unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker, which is easy to reach though a bit stiff, is on the left and just above it is the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top features the 3.5 mm headset jack (left uncovered) and the microUSB port, which is protected by a sliding cover. The bottom only features the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back you?ll find the 5 MP camera lens and the loudspeaker grill. There?s no camera flash, nor any camera lens protection just like on the original. The characteristic hump at the bottom of the back keeps most of the phones back (including the camera) slightly away from the surface that the phone is lying on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You shouldn?t rely too much on this to prevent scratches and it certainly doesn?t prevent fingerprint smudges on the camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a small bump next to the loudspeaker, which somewhat prevents it from being muffled when the phone is placed on a level surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping the back cover open (careful, those tend to crack near the volume rocker), you'll see the battery and the SIM and microSD card slots. The microSD card slot is easily hot-swappable but the SIM card is obstructed by the battery. You might still manage to pry it out, but it's best to just shut the phone off and take the battery out before handling the SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery is a 1650 mAh Li-Ion unit ? that?s 10% higher capacity than in the original Galaxy S. A higher-clocked CPU uses more power and a bigger battery makes sense. Official numbers put the talk time at nearly 13 hours (in 2G, half that in 3G) and and also promise almost a month of standby. Those numbers are quite like those quoted for the original Galaxy S and are as far away from the truth as they were with the Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our browser battery test, the Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus lasted 4:30 hours. That puts it around the middle of the Android pack, on par with the LG Optimus Black (another single-core droid). Surprisingly (or not), the Galaxy S Plus outlasted the original Galaxy S by nearly half an hour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design may be a bit old, but it allows comfortable handling and the styling is clean and uncluttered. The all-plastic build is nothing to be excited about though on the upside, fingerprints are less of an issue in the new edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Plus is a fairly compact device for a 4-incher. However, if you look at other recent devices, the Galaxy S II shows that a 4.3" screen is possible at roughly the same dimensions too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User Interface: older TouchWiz does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Plus runs Android 2.3.3 with the custom TouchWiz topping. This is not Samsung's latest launcher we saw on the Galaxy S II but the older version 3.0. There isn?t a whole lot of change compared to the original Galaxy S ? which by the way has already received its Gingerbread upgrade too. To get an idea of how the Galaxy S Plus handles, check out the user interface video demo below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll be reusing texts from past reviews but you should rest assured that we?ve updated all the content to match the Galaxy S Plus specifics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen fits up to 7 panes, which can be managed quite easily. A pinch zoom on screen takes you to edit mode where you can add, remove and rearrange the panes as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area which you pull down from the top of the screen has seen some visual changes since the Gingerbread update but no new features. You can turn Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Sounds and auto-rotation on and off. You also get information about active connections and missed events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is basically unchanged from the original Galaxy S, except that the icons have lost their color backgrounds to look a lot less iPhone-like. The menu is side-scrollable, with a 4 x 4 grid of icons on each page, the four docked icons at the bottom visible at all times. You can also opt for a list view. Rearranging apps is very easy to ? in edit mode just drag an icon where you want it placed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of wallpapers you get the standard gallery with a collection of live and static wallpapers that have seen no changes since the Galaxy S days. Some of the live ones look pretty cool on the SuperAMOLED display but they do tend to drain your battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have long added a task manager to their TouchWiz launcher. Complete with a homescreen widget that shows the number of currently active apps, it saves you the need to install a task killer on your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Performance-wise the Galaxy S Plus is fluid and very responsive and we experienced no lags whatsoever. You can scratch that one on the 1.4GHz processor as it handles the UI without a glitch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>1.4 GHz processor performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In terms of synthetic benchmarks the Galaxy S Plus is way ahead of the original 1GHz-running Galaxy S. Using the 1.4 GHz Qualcomm MSM8255T Snapdragon chipset, the retail version of the Galaxy S Plus outperformed the original Galaxy S in almost every benchmark we ran. It only fails to prevail in the GPU benchmarks where its outdated Adreno 205 falls short of the PowerVR SGX540 in the Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the numbers - Linpack, BenchmarkPi, Smartbench 2011 and Neocore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the Quadrant score where the Galaxy S Plus slightly outscores its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now let's check out the GPU showdown. The Galaxy S Plus is running on the Adreno 205 GPU while the original Galaxy S has the PowerVR SGX540 inside (the iPhone 4, for example, is running on the older PowerVR SGX535). We used Nenamark 2 for this showdown. The Galaxy S Plus got a score of 15.9fps (frames per second) while the original Galaxy S outscored it with 27.5fps. So as you can see even if the 1.4GHz Snapdragon processor is better in overall performance over the 1GHz Hummingbird of the original Galaxy S, the GPU performance is in favor of the latter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should clarify that both the original Galaxy S and the Galaxy S Plus are running on the latest Android Gingerbread version 2.3.3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A faster GPU is better for playing high-quality games and videos in the browser so it's definitely a plus - just not for the Galaxy S Plus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook: social and efficient<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A typical Android smartphone, the Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus has a phonebook with complete functionality and practically unlimited capacity. It's the Samsung customizations that give it an edge against competitors using the same platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swipe gestures are an important part of that. In the main contact list, or any other list with names and numbers, a swipe to the right on a name will dial the contact?s default number, while a swipe to the left will start the New message interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many details that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there?s also quick contact pop-ups but those require two clicks rather than a swipe. On the other hand they also offer video call and email as options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset displays the phone memory, SIM-stored and all Google contacts in the phonebook. There is a dedicated setting for that, so you really can have all of your contacts gathered in one place. You can search the entries by either sweep-scrolling or using the alphabet scroll at the side of the screen (another Samsung-made feature).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung Galaxy S plus, we had no reception or in-call voice quality issues. Smart Dial is enabled, one of the best implementations we have seen at that. The I9001 Galaxy S Plus searches both contact numbers and names. The number of matches found is displayed next to the first pick and if you press that button the whole list will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, your screen will automatically turn off during a call. The available options during a call include taking a note, using the keypad, muting, holding the call or adding another call to the conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It shows all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list sorting your call history by contacts. There?re also favorites and frequent contacts lists that show your starred contacts alphabetically and the numbers you have called most often by number of calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Galaxy S Plus and it scored a Good mark, which places it above the original Galaxy S. The sound is a little bit louder and you won't miss any calls even in loud environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more about the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is quite straightforward - there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook ? a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an application-specific search feature that lets you quickly find a given message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add message recipients, just start typing the corresponding name or number and choose from the contacts offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Any unsent messages and drafts are marked with a "Draft" label so you can tell them apart from the rest. What we really like is that each thread keeps the text in the tap-to-compose box even if you exit without sending or explicitly save it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically converted into an MMS. You can just quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Input options include the standard Samsung keypad which is easy to use and the Swype keyboard, which lets you type in words by dragging a thumb over the letters the word comprises of. If you swipe-in a word that crosses characters with another word Swype automatically pops-up a prompt to choose the one you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, you get a generic email app and a dedicated Gmail app. They both work great and get set up in a matter of seconds. Both support multiple emails and mass delete, forward, move, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus has the stock Android gallery, rather than a custom TouchWiz version. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos placed in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder, which is very convenient - just like a file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you can organize photos by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date scrubber, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are checking out a photo, you can use the tabs at the top of the screen to jump back to the main gallery screen, without having to go several folders back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view. Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear. Multi-touch is, of course, enabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Visual music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Plus uses the TouchWiz music player. The interface consists of several tabs for the sorting options: current playlist, all tracks, playlists and albums, artists and composers. You are free to remove the unneeded ones to make the interface easier to navigate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, equalizer presets are enabled on the Galaxy S Plus along with Samsung?s DNSe technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And with the added eye-candy, album view and song scrolling, things are almost as good as they can get now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search too. The handset prompts you to choose whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album. What?s even better, the YouTube search results are loaded straight into the YouTube client.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus audio output is pretty different, depending on the way you use it. It has great performance with an active external amplifier, but it's not quite as impressive when a pair of headphones is used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in the first part of our test, with no resistance applied to the Galaxy S Plus line-out, the scores are just great. There are really no weak points to its performance here and the only thing to frown at is its relatively low volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things weren't quite so perfect in the second part, though. The main problem is the rapid increase in stereo crosstalk, but the volume levels also turn for worse. The general result is still passable, but we've certainly seen better here. The Galaxy S Plus is slightly worse than its forefather.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Plus inherits the video player from the original Galaxy S. It?s easy to use and offers wide-ranging codec support. DivX and Xvid are covered and up to 720p playback too. The 1650mAh Li-Ion battery can hold for at least two movies straight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player app has a nice and simple interface that automatically disappears when not used to allow you to enjoy your videos fullscreen. The on-screen controls boil down to play/pause and skip buttons, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple ? there?s a tuning dial and you can save as many as 6 stations as favorites. You can also listen on the loudspeaker, but the headset still needs to be plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM Radio on the Galaxy S Plus differs from the one on the original Galaxy S because it outputs stereo sound, while the Galaxy S had a mono unit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Plain old camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Plus has a 5 MP camera on its back, capable of producing images of up to 2592 x 1944 pixel resolution. It's nothing new - in fact it has remained unchained throughout the lineup, from the Galaxy S, through the SL and Armani. It lacks important attributes such as a flash and a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is standard Samsung for the most part ? and that?s not a bad thing. It?s easily thumbable and offers readily accessible scene and shooting modes. Geotagging, face and smile detection are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Galaxy S Plus offers no advantage over the original Galaxy S - the sensor is exactly the same and produces the exact same results as the one on the original Galaxy S. In short, it?s not the best 5 MP camera around. Images turn out slightly underexposed and colors are duller than we would?ve liked. You could definitely do worse though, the Galaxy S Plus is good enough for the occasional snapshot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes a macro shot from the Galaxy S Plus camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Plus enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 5MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Plus is not that good as a sharp shooter. Keep in mind that any differences with the original Galaxy S are due to the lighting at the particular time of the shoot. Overall, the camera on the Galaxy S Plus's back may not be the ultimate but you will be fine if you're not a camera-phone buff.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording does HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Plus is among the HD-capable smartphones out there. It can record up to 720p videos (1280 x 720) at 30 fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being the same camera as on the original Galaxy S, it reproduces the same videos as well. The HD footage recorded in mp4 format plays out perfectly smooth. Image quality is decent and the amount of resolved detail is good (if unspectacular), but the colors are a bit oversaturated and the dynamic range could be a bit better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look at this 720p video sample made with the Samsung Galaxy S Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an untouched 720p video sample for download.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you can see the Galaxy S Plus is on par with the previous Galaxy S original. It produces nice video quality and a good amount of fine detail. Compared other players in the 720p game like the LG Optimus Black and Motorola Atrix it's much better but still falls short of devices like the Nokia N8 and the Apple iPhone 4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The I9001 Galaxy S Plus has its connectivity bases covered: worldwide ready quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA with download rates of up to 14.4 Mbps and 5.76 Mbps of upload - that's twice as fast HSDPA speed as that of its predecessor, the original Galaxy S and it really brings the Galaxy S Plus to current standards of 3G speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar to the first Galaxy S phone ? the I9001 offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n), the new Bluetooth v3.0 with A2DP support and USB v2.0. The USB interface is standard microUSB, which makes finding a suitable cable a lot easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides its 8GB of integrated storage, the Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus supports microSD cards of up to 32GB. The slot is under the battery cover. There is also 2GB of ROM, with 1.5 GB free space for app installation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm standard audio port completes the connectivity tally. You can keep your favorite headphones and use them with the Galaxy S Plus hassle-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Solid web browsing has been an inherent part of Android since day one. Version 2.3.3 Gingerbread is the fastest yet ? and there?s Flash to really open up the Web (which for better or worse still relies heavily on Flash for video streaming and navigation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser chrome is out of sight by default. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in and pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That way you have the entire 4? screen for web browsing. The Galaxy S Plus browser supports two zoom methods ? double tap and pinch-zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports text reflow, but it works only with double tap zooming ? a moment after setting the zoom level, columns of text align to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1.4 GHz Snapdragon processor inside the Galaxy S Plus gives a shoulder of support to watching videos right inside the browser. It can play YouTube videos up to 720p trouble free. With the original Galaxy S you get a more laggy experience while loading 720p videos in the browser. With the Galaxy S Plus there's a significant amount of snappiness. Flash games in the browser were no problem either. We used Kongregate as our testing playground.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages look nice on the ample 4? SuperAMOLED display, although it?s not the same experience as on the bigger, superior SuperAMOLED Plus screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music &amp; Social Hubs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music Hub app lets you browse music online with search, charts, new releases and featured content. You can preview songs (30 seconds each) and buy tracks or whole albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Social hub combines you email accounts with social networking (Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn) and IM accounts (Gtalk, MSN and Yahoo! Messenger) and shows all incoming messages as one list with handy shortcuts to reply, mark as favorite and so on. There?s filtering by message source too, to help manage the inflow of incoming updates.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Plus has you covered in terms of organizer and office features, offering everything from a file manager through all sorts of time-keeping apps to a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual Samsung has included the My Files app ? a simple to use but functional file manager, which also doubles as an image gallery. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files over Bluetooth. It will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can?t access the inbuilt memory like some third-party file browsers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - agenda, daily, weekly and monthly. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notes app is very simple and easy to use. You enter a note and then it's displayed on a virtual pin board. You can change the colors of the notes. The notes are interactive and recognize phone numbers and addresses which you can call or view upon a touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ThinkFree Office is pre-installed ? a document viewer and an editor. It works like a charm and is capable of pinch zooming. Both panning and zooming are fast and the overall performance of the Office package is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a nicely touch optimized calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder app has seen no changes since the original Galaxy S. It's very easy to use and you can listen to your previous recordings any time by hitting the list button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app offers alarms, world clock, stopwatch and timer. They are all pretty much self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basically everything you might need is present on the Galaxy S Plus in terms of organizing your daily life. And anything extra you might need can be found in the Android Market.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS is on Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus comes with a GPS receiver and offers A-GPS for quicker satellite lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the titular application and its Street View mode is probably the best part of the deal in places where turn-by-turn voice navigation isn?t yet offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our I9001 Galaxy S Plus came with Google Maps 5.x with Navigation (where supported). While it requires a live internet connection as you go, there?s offline rerouting too ? if you stray off your course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without connection though. You also get 3D buildings (where that's available), two-finger rotation and tilting, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation using Google Maps Navigation is available in select countries and unless you live in any of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Maps app also offers a rich database of POIs: cafes, restaurants and all sorts of businesses like banks (ATMs too), hospitals, police departments and much more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market has plenty of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus is running the latest available version of Android and has a WVGA screen, giving you access to the whole Android Market (some apps won?t run on older versions or low-res screens).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Plus makes sense for people who don't want to spend over the odds on the latest tech. Samsung is probably right not to make a big noise about it. The phone was first announced as a Russia-bound upgrade of the original Galaxy S. It will be released in other markets too, it is now certain. And we know it does just enough to stay afloat in the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, we don't mean the dual-core heavy-hitters or the 3D and Full HD enabled media monsters. The Galaxy S Plus is still stuck on the old 5MP camera, 720p video recording and the old PenTile SuperAMOLED screen. But it does well to bring a speed boost to an already solid performer. And even though it is no match for dual-core, an overclocked single core chipset is powerful enough for almost everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users coming from the original Galaxy S aren't too likely to consider the Galaxy S Plus. It's more of an affordable alternative of the current flagship, the Galaxy S II. The Galaxy SL is another copy of the original Galaxy S only without the SuperAMOLED display. We guess it will make no sense for the SL and the Plus to compete on the same markets. If they do, the SL will be seriously disadvantaged by the lack of a SuperAMOLED screen. That can be fine too, if the price difference is right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S ? Galaxy S II ? Samsung Galaxy SL</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Plus will feel the heat from the recent crop of Sony Ericsson droids. The Xperia Arc boasts a bigger Bravia engine display, a superior 8 MP camera and the impressive exterior of a true flagship. Still, it does fall a little short of the 1.4GHz processor inside the Galaxy S Plus. And if you think the Arc is in a different league, the Xperia Neo may as well be considered for its imaging.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The LG Optimus black commensurates with the Galaxy S Plus in terms of specs - it has a 4" NOVA display, which means it's much more bright, a 5 MP snapper on its back which produces crisper photos and offers the latest Wi-Fi Direct technology for faster sharing. It does fall short in 3G speed, processing power and offers only the outdated Android 2.2 Froyo.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Finally, an old rivalry is likely to be renewed. The Galaxy S vs. the Desire used to be a crowd-pleaser a year ago and now it's up to the Galaxy S Plus and the Desire S to keep it going. The Desire S offers the HTC Sense experience and great build. And let's not forget the HTC Incredible S which closes the gap on the display front as far as size goes. It also brings a higher resolution camera to the table. The Galaxy S Plus has the upper hand in terms of screen quality and processing power, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Incredible S ? HTC Desire S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen and processing power: these are the key ingredients of the Samsung I9001 Galaxy S Plus. OK, the display is of the old PenTile variety but it's still Super AMOLED. And 1.4GHz is impressive clock speed, only beat by dual core.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main point for many readers here today is if this slightly tuned-up version of the Galaxy S is worthit better than the original one which is still on sale. Well, you get a plus and a minus - the better processor and the slower GPU. Sure, HSDPA speeds have doubled to 14.4 Mbps but that hardly is enough to justify the higher asking price. And the speed boost isn't that obvious even when you pit the two devices one against the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They call it the Galaxy S 2011 edition. It's no more than a slight upgrade. The Galaxy S Plus won't let you down if you take it for what it says on the tin but the same goes for the original Galaxy S.</paragraph>
