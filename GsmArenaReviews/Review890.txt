			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With so many flagship "plus ones" out there, it's refreshing to see something truly revolutionary. The LG G Flex is curved like a Beckham free kick and has a flexible screen and battery, along with a unique self-healing coating on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex is curved top to bottom and, as the name suggests, it can flex. It's not bendable like rubber, you have to really put some muscle to it. It's quite impressive all the same, as nothing about phones is flexible, not the screen glass, not the screen itself, nor the motherboard or battery. Oh well, they didn't use to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG leaned on its component manufacturing skills and created a Plastic OLED (POLED) screen that's flexible (more so than the G Flex itself). The next step is a curved, flexible Lithium Polymer battery (a world first). Despite its odd shape and 8.7mm thickness of the phone, the battery has a respectable 3,500mAh capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen measures the massive 6", but the curve of the device helps the ergonomics. While it impresses with size and flexibility, the screen has only 720p resolution (245ppi). Here's hoping that the new technology makes up for the lacking density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While flexible screens and batteries might become more popular with wearable devices (say a smartwatch that wraps around your wrist), the next trick might become standard for all sorts of devices - the coating on the back can heal itself if scratched. This will put an end to all the silly cases and protectors that just make phones thick and ugly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the breaking news, the LG G Flex is just the phablet version of the LG G2 with a Snapdragon 800 chipset, 13MP camera (no OIS though), Optimus UI gestures and updated multitasking (with a split-screen option). It even has the trademark hardware controls on the back. The Optimus G Pro is getting a little old and small and the LG Vu 3 is a niche product with its 4:3 screen, so another phablet is a welcome addition to LG's fleet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex name will outlive the device itself - years from now we'll be covering flexible devices or ones with self-healing finish and we'll add "like the LG G Flex pioneered back in 2013". But we're not there yet, for now you can read more about the Flex's design and build on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the LG G Flex<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex comes in a box with a concave top, matching the curvature of the device itself. The contents of the box are virtually identical to what we found in the LG G2's package - a compact charger (1.8 amps), a microUSB cable to go with it and a one-piece headset. The headset has in-ear plugs, tangle-free cables and a three-button remote.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G Flex 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex measures 160.5 x 81.6 x 8.7mm, which is what you would expect of a 6" device, but its curvature gives it a unique profile. The phablet weighs 177g, which is actually a bit below the norm for this size.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The basic design of the LG G Flex is that of the LG G2, again except for the signature curve. It's larger than the G2, but the curve improves landscape hold and makes it very comfortable to actually use as a phone - something phablets are not particularly good at. We're not sure about pocketability though - at least the flexible screen and body make it less vulnerable perhaps if you sit with the phone in your back pocket. Not that we tried.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front has fairly thin bezels around the large 6" screen and is very clean with just the earpiece and the LG logo below the display. LG has long settled for on-screen buttons, though for some reason the company uses the old Back, Home, Menu arrangement (there are options to customize this, we'll get back to this in the software section).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is the 2.1MP/1080p front-facing camera, the RGB notification light and the ambient light and proximity sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back deserves attention for its trademark design of having the volume rocker and power key just below the camera lens, but also for its special coating. It's a unique coating that heals itself if scratched. This means there's no need for a protective cover, the G Flex's back will stay unscathed even without one. In terms of looks, the back glossy with a brushed look, not unlike the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an LED that illuminates the power key (blue light only), which acts as a notification light just like the RGB light on the front. LG's software allows you to enable which apps can use the LED separately for the front and back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symmetrically around the camera/volume rocker/power key center line are two small squares, one of which is the LED flash and the other is the IR blaster. This is an unusual place to put the IR blaster, but it's actually better than putting it on top (which is a throwback to remote controls going decades back). With this design you can hold the device as a phablet rather than a remote when you control your equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going back to the camera, it's a 13MP shooter with f/2.4 aperture, which can record 1080p video at up to 60fps. Unlike the LG G2 camera, however, this one lacks optical image stabilization (OIS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the LG G Flex also features the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phablet houses a microUSB 2.0 port with SlimPort functionality, meaning it doubles as a TV-Out and USB Host with the proper adaptors. The audio jack is at the bottom, just like on the G2. Also here is the mouthpiece, the secondary microphone is on the top side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left and right side of the phablet are mostly clean, since LG moved all the controls around back. There's only the microSIM port on the left side of the phablet. You need an eject pin to open it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover is a one of a kind flexible battery. It's a curved Li-Po unit with the massive 3,500mAh and it is, of course, non-removable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>True to its name, the LG G Flex can indeed be flexed but it takes effort. You can put it face down on a flat table and push down until it's straight and you won't damage the phone. There's no practical use for this other than to impress your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curve improves ergonomics - your fingers move in arcs rather than a straight line - and the way the device can slip in and out of pants pockets. Portability in coat pockets and purses is actually hurt a bit by the curve as the phablet tends to take up more space than a flat, 8.7mm thick phablet would. And while you can slip it in your pants pocket, we suspect most 6" phablets spend most of their time in coats, purses or backpacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curve does have an additional advantage of keeping most of the surface away from a table. If you put the G Flex face down, the screen will be away from the table and if you put it on the back, only the middle bit will be exposed to scratches. We should note that there's no wobble whatsoever either way.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex has a new brand of OLED screen - Plastic OLED - manufactured by LG. Traditional OLEDS have their light diodes on a sheet of glass, but by using a plastic substrate LG managed to make the display flexible. The display unit itself can flex more than the phablet itself, but LG settled on this curvature as the most comfortable after testing numerous prototypes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the screen has a massive 6" diagonal but the resolution is fairly low for the size, 720p. This works out to 245ppi, which is a mid-range number. Still, it's a full RGB matrix rather than a PenTile, which does help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there's a problem - at first we thought it was image noise in the wallpaper, but as we looked closer, we saw it in the UI too. The display seems to have issues lighting its pixels evenly, which causes the noisy look. The pixel density isn't high-enough to hide individual pixel errors either. The end result is fairly disappointing for a device in such a high price bracket, because once you see the problem, you start noticing it everywhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We used our microscope to snap a close-up photo to illustrate the problem. We took a screenshot of the LG G Flex UI and put it on our trusty old Nokia N8 (which has an AMOLED screen of comparable pixel density). The image below shows what the image looks like on the G Flex, on the N8 and finally, what it's supposed to look like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG is promising 330 nits of brightness, which isn't very high even for an OLED (and LCDs can more than double that). Our own measurements put the maximum brightness at 411 nits and we kept the brightness slider at or near the maximum most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically for OLED, the display has stellar contrast and rich, saturated colors. Following the lead of Samsung and Nokia, LG introduced modes for the screen, which let the user control the saturation. You get three options - Standard, Vivid and Natural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is fairly reflective, which combined with the relatively low brightness results in sub-par sunlight legibility. By the way, LG claims the curvature helps reduce glare but, although we can see a point, we failed to notice a significant difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The screen is protected by curved Gorilla glass. That's scratch-resistant but, unlike the coating on the back, once you scratch it, the damage will stay. We guess the special coating isn't transparent enough for screens yet, but it's something that's sorely needed by smartphones. All scratch-resistant glass eventually gets scratched and while we can live with gouges on the back, damage to the screen is harder to tolerate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex has a huge 3,500mAh battery despite 8.7mm thick body that is curved to boot. A large OLED screen isn't ideal for long battery life, but in the end things seem to balance out. The endurance rating is a stunning 97 hours - you can expect to go between two and three days without charging, depending on how much web browsing you do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing is the Achilles heel - the G Flex lasted nine and a half hours, which while good is not much for the class. Talk time and video playback are at or near the top though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G Flex runs on Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex may have a couple of firsts for the company, but the software package is by no means breaking news. The G Flex runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean with the latest Optimus UI skinning the entire OS. The customizations run deep and there's a rich selection of themes, icon sets and home-brewed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the LG G Flex on video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall user experience is still very similar to the one on the LG G2, though the latest Optimus UI version brings a couple of features unseen before on any LG smartphone. LG G Flex comes with some cool options like Dual Window Multi-tasking, the Q-Theather multimedia hub, smart ringtone volume and answer on pick up, along with a new live wallpaper with motion control for the lockscreen. We'll get to all of them as we go along.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock key at the rear is still a reasonable novelty and one that works equally well - if not better - on the curved, bigger body of the Flex. you can wake the screen with a double tap on it. Unlike the G2 though, where we had to put a little more force while knocking, the G Flex will register even the gentlest of taps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To lock the phone you don't need to use the hardware key either. You just double tap on an empty area of your homescreen or on the status bar no matter where you are - it will lock your G Flex.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has come up with a brand new live wallpaper for the lockscreen. It has a day and a night theme, which change automatically. The cool thing is the wallpaper can be further explored by swinging the phone up and down to make the background slide within the curve. It's just for show really - you don't get extra shortcuts or features, just reveal more of the background image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unlock effect also changes depending on where are you touching - on water or air. You can opt for standard lockscreen wallpapers too, where you can choose between five unlock effects. In terms of functionality, you can also place up to five shortcuts on your lockscreen to unlock the phone straight into an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen can span across multiple panes, each containing one full-screen widget. The page to the right is special and fires up the camera, but you can easily disable it in the widget menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pages to the left contain different widgets - four different clocks, Gmail, Google Now, Calendar, Google+ posts, Quick Remote and Weather. More apps can be downloaded off the Play Store to add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the multiple account support, LG is able to support the so-called Guest Mode, activated by a specific unlock pattern. There's no app drawer in guest mode - you can access up to five apps: camera, video and music players, calculator and quick remote. You can, of course, make more apps available from the suggested list. To exit guest mode and make the full functionality available you'll need to lock the screen and unlock into standard mode using the regular unlock routine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Guest mode will come in handy if you are handing your phone to a child or you just want to keep your stuff personal from friends, who might like to use your phone for a quick call or anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the G Flex homescreen fits up to 5 shortcuts (including the shortcut to the App Drawer). You don't have to use all available slots though - you can discard all but the App Drawer shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the shortcuts are visible on any of the homescreen panes. With the exception of the app drawer shortcut, you can rearrange, delete or replace any of these with shortcuts of your choosing, even folders. In fact, most aspects of the phone's behavior can be customized, you can go to as small detail as the capacitive key layout and functionality, background, lock animation, system fonts, and even the notification light on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default you get three homescreen panes to fill up with widgets and shortcuts, but you are free to add more (up to seven) or delete unneeded ones to speed up navigation. You can also set any of the homescreen panes as default. Loop scrolling is enabled on the homescreen - panes spin on a carousel with a rather convincing spherical effect, reinforced by the curved screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen auto-rotates too as you flip the device landscape - a must have in phablets, even more so on the G Flex, whose curved body really makes landscape hold the more logical one. Everything on the screen rotates to fit the orientation, even the capacitive keys' icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front touch buttons (Back, Home and Menu being the default layout) are also highly customizable. You can choose between several preset combinations that change the order and functionality, some even adding an extra permanent shortcut for either Quick Memo or the Notification area. You can also set a black or white background for the keys and control the opacity. There is also an option to swipe the controls left or right for one-handed operations. Finally, you can even choose apps where those controls will be hidden, letting you use the entire screen. Nice!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG home-baked tweaks and enhancements are by no means limited to the visuals. The Q Slide option makes it possible for you to use widget-like resizable small apps while using other full-screen apps. The system-wide Quick Memo integration allows you to take a screenshot anywhere in the phone and take notes over it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can resize widgets or you can even shrink a widget down to the corresponding app's icon. Also, if you move a widget over an occupied slot on the homescreen, the icons underneath immediately move out of the way, which is really neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen is done by tapping and holding on a blank area of a homescreen pane. A context menu appears, allowing you to add various customizations to your phone. The tabs along the bottom let you select the appropriate app, widget or wallpaper, which you can add to the homescreen of your choice. Gridlines will appear when you hold and drag an app or widget, allowing you to easily place it on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a set of different icons to choose from and you can even make custom ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contextual menu gives you a quick access to different settings, as well as themes. There are only two themes available on the G Flex and the new Flex theme is really a lot more stylish than the messy default option on the G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can get more themes for free at the LG Smart World app store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already mentioned the Q Slide shortcuts that are found in the notification area. They launch pop-up widget-like versions of the video player, web browser, phone, messages, calendar, email, memo, voice recorder, file manager and calculator. In case you don't need some of those shortcuts, you can remove them via the edit key at the end of the shortcut row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Q Slide feature is very similar to Sony's small apps but supports only two windows opened simultaneously. You can resize the mini app the way you like, and there is a dedicated shortcut that'll take you to the full screen app. There is also a transparency scrubber - once you decrease the transparency even by a hair, the mini app is no longer part of the active UI (besides its transparency scrubber) and you can interact with whatever's beneath it (the mini app will continue its work of course, i.e. a video will still be playing).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has also been tweaked by LG to let you rearrange the toggle buttons available. You are also free to add and remove toggles from the edit menu. You can add an insane amount of shortcuts here, and don't have to worry about whether they'll fit on the screen - the row becomes side-scrollable so you can still access them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, if you have a music track playing in the background, quick controls will show up here. You can also swipe notifications to the left or right to dismiss them. Notifications can be expanded as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher (tap on hold on Home) shows you all of the currently running apps, which can be swiped left or right to terminate. There's a shortcut to the task manager too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's task manager lists the running apps and the current use of RAM, conveniently offering a button to stop all running apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of app switching, LG has implemented a new multi-tasking feature called Slide Aside. You can use a three-finger swipe from the right side of the screen to add the app into the Slide Aside UI, while three finger swipes from the left will switch between the running apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Slide Aside supports up to three apps which get into a sort of frozen state and you can access a preview of all the three apps either form the notification area's dedicated shortcut or via a three-finger swipe to the left on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like this way of multitasking, but it isn't implemented that well on the G Flex. There is some improvement over the G2, but the phone still failed sometimes to recognize the swipes and the whole left/right swipe across the screen to open/switch routine feels a bit awkward.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer lists all your available apps and widgets, with a dedicated tab for user downloads. There is a button in the top right corner, which triggers edit mode and lets you to easily reshuffle or uninstall applications. You can also hide the apps you don't need but you can't install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to make the icons in the app drawer bigger, too. If you select an app whilst in edit mode, a pop up will let you see information like storage footprint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG borrowed a few tricks from Samsung's TouchWiz and implemented its own version of Samsung's Smart Stay, called...Smart screen. It uses the front cam to detect whether you're looking at the screen. This means you can browse the phone for hours on end without it auto-locking itself. We can confirm that the feature works very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartVideo on the other hand will pause a currently playing video when you look away. That's another thing copied over from TouchWiz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But wait, there is more! LG has its own alternative to the Multi Window split screen feature from TouchWiz as well. LG calls it Dual Window and it lets you run two apps side by side. You can adjust the division line giving one app more space. Only compatible apps can be used with Multi-window, for now that means mostly the ones that come preinstalled on the phone. You can't run two instances of the same app like you can do on the latest TouchWiz UI. You can still easily swap the two apps or resize the windows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, yet another TouchWiz feature sneaks into Optimus UI - the Answer Me option. If enabled, the G Flex will automatically answer an incoming call once you bring the phone to your ear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called Quick Memo function is integrated in the phone's OS, allowing you to capture screen shots of anything (including the lockscreen!) and scribble notes over them like you would on the LG Optimus G, G Pro and G2. You can save the result as an image or add it to the Notebook app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can launch the Quick Memo without unlocking the phone while holding the volume up key (holding the volume down fires up the camera). Otherwise you can launch the app pretty much from everywhere via its dedicated shortcut in the notification area or with a swipe up gesture on the Home key. If you've enabled the Quick Memo key on the navigation bar, it's probably the easiest way to access this feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Quiet Mode is also enabled. It works in a similar way to the Do Not Disturb feature on iOS 6 and the Blocking Mode at Samsung's Galaxies. It gives you extra control over incoming call alerts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If turned on, Quiet mode will mute incoming calls and you can set the time of day when it gets activated every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like DnD on iOS 6, Quet mode has an exception list where you can add some contacts that won't be affected by its restrictions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily activate Quiet mode from the dedicated toggle in the Settings menu. When it is on, an icon appears in the left corner of the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another reasonably useful feature is the Clip Tray. Upon a tap and hold on links, images, music and video files, phone numbers or just chinks of text, you can copy them to the Clip Tray to paste later in messages, emails, the browser, etc. The Clip Tray items are displayed at the bottom of the screen (you must have at least 2 items in the tray).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is one more new feature we need to discuss - the One-hand operations. We saw this a while ago on the Huawei Ascend Mate. With One hand operations enabled, you can move the screen unlock, dialer, and the keyboard to the left or right of the screen, depending on which hand you are using. It's a handy feature to have on such a big device. You can also enable one-hand operations for the system-wide capacitive keys.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG G Flex, like most of the latest flagships, is powered by the Snapdragon 800 chipset. The four Krait 400 cores tick at 2.27GHz, the graphics are handled by Adreno 330 chip and the amount of available RAM is 2GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We test the single-core performance with the BenchmarkPi. The LG G Flex did excellently and joined its G2 sibling and the Galaxy Note 3 phablet on the top spot.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack is putting all four Krait 400 cores to a test and the LG G Flex produced another chart-toping score.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next benchmark we ran is the GeekBench 3. It evaluates CPU and memory performance but the G Flex, just like the G2, failed to deliver impressive performance and fell short of the Sony and Samsung latest flagships.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant and AnTuTu assess the overall device performance. Here LG G Flex once again was flying high, producing two first place scores, just a whisker better than Galaxy Note 3 and LG G2. The lower 720p display resolution is what probably helped it here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>It's time to test the Adreno 330 graphics performance. Since the LG G Flex is using a 720p display we expect it to behave noticeably better than the rest of the Snapdragon 800 smartphones running on 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the GFXBenchmark on 1080p off-screen resolution in order to test the raw power of the Adreno 330. Unsurprisingly, it turned out just as powerful as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G2's graphics chips.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Just like the rest of the S800 gang the LG G Flex offers blazing fast performance and smooth user experience. Thanks to the lower-res display the G Flex feels even faster than the competition on some occassions. It is one of the fastest smartphones on the market with lag-free Android experience and will disappoint no one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now and Q Voice assistants<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and if allowed, it can access your daily routine, internet searches and email to give you information more relevant to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version of Google Now (November 2013) will allow you to have short dialogues with the app AI when you are conducting searches. In these dialogues, Google Now should be able to understand when you referring to your search term by an indirect pronoun instead of using its full name. It will also answer back when there are several options for action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now in the form of cards. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, so it offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions into Now. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has added lots of more customization on Google Now in Android 4.4 KitKat. You can now set your default transportation method, you favorite sports teams, company stocks you are following, places you are interested to visit and more. Once you add items you want to keep an eye on Google Now will do this instead of you. It will automatically inform you for various changes, news and updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The More section of the customization will update automatically with topics you can choose from once you've start using Google Now search capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can now set reminders straight from Google Now's UI. Just hit the bottom left icon (the palm with a stretched index finger). There you can add reminders or just check all the past, ongoing or upcoming reminders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google Now is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Q Voice is LG's answer to Apple's Siri and Samsung's S-Voice. Q Voice can be used to initiate a call, dictate text, play music, launch apps, change a setting, make memos, add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice Mate does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual phone and it has some added features. The problem with Voice Mate is that it works only in Korean for now (but support for more languages should be on the way), it is not nearly as fast or as accurate in recognizing your speech input as Now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the LG G Flex is pretty much the standard Jelly Bean affair with Optimus UI goodies sprinkled on top. It has a tabbed interface, in which the central tab lists all contacts alphabetically. You can navigate the tabs by swipes or, alternatively, touch the specific tab labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact images, where available, are displayed and there's a quick alphabet scroll on the right. There's also a regular search bar on top of the contacts list. The other tabs are Groups and Favorites on the right and Dial and Call logs on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phonebook from getting messy - you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, Twitter contacts and so on). The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed - First Name, Last Name or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the usual Android fashion, a tap on a contact photo brings up the quick contacts shortcuts. You can call the contact, send text or email or view their profile. You can also make a video call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the name of a single contact brings up their details. Once you're there, you can edit the contact info by hitting the pencil icon in the upper right corner, while the star icon in the upper right will add them to favorites. Editing a contact is pretty straightforward; you can add or remove fields as needed, as well as specify the types of phone numbers, email addresses, ringtones, additional fields and even add notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VuTalk is also onboard. Once you register your number through the service you will be able to talk and draw at the same time with another friend who has the VuTalk active. It's a nice feature, but this means your other friend should own an LG smartphone as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex had no trouble holding on to signal (even where signal was poor) and the in-call audio is consistently good and decently loud. It also supports native video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer is basically a part of the Contacts app and integrates the Call log, Contacts and Favorites, each within its own tab. Again, these tabs are side-swipeable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is clever and groups some of the calls, e.g. 3 missed calls from the same contact on the same day. A number next to the contact name shows the number of events. It's a great space saving feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works for both numbers and names. Only one matching contact is displayed, but if you tap the down arrow button, the rest show up as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can pop-up the dialer should you need to dial another number. Also you can use the phone while on a call, just hit the menu key and a small green line replaces the notification area and acts like a shortcut back to the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the LG G Flex, to find out that it has a loud enough speaker for the ringer to be heard even in noisier environments. It scored a Good mark, so missed calls and notifications are unlikely. We still suggest keeping the vibration on though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex can handle all common message types: SMS, MMS and email. Email capability is excellent with support for Exchange available out of box, and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of SNS integration as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding multimedia to a message is pretty straightforward - just hit the attach button next to the text field and select a number of available options, such as images, videos, voice recording, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk. A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts, and operates in much the same fashion as the Gmail one. If you add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy, although there's no conversation-style view like in Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Hangouts is the default app that handles instant messaging (Facebook is preinstalled, but Facebook Messenger isn't). Since its latest update it can also handle SMS and MMS messaging - Google's attempt at unifying all messaging services and while the initial release has some quirks that need ironing, it looks to be a promising platform. If you like it, you can set is as a default app for your SMS messaging too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY, Swype, voice and handwriting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex offers a standard QWERTY keyboard, which features both portrait and landscape typing. The keyboard fills up the screen nicely and offers great ergonomics with ample spacing between keys, still leaving enough room above the keyboard for you to see what you're actually typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of speed and accuracy are commendable in both portrait and landscape. There's a dedicated setting that enables keypress vibrations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt for one-hand mode, where the keyboard becomes smaller and sticks to the left or right side of the screen. It's invoked by flicking the portrait keyboard sideways and that way you can use it only with your thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also split the landscape keyboard in two by doing a simple pinch gesture on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Swype-like (LG dubbed it Path keyboard) input as well, though it's somewhat uncomfortably out of sight in the Input Language submenu. You need to enable Shape Writer instead of the standard QWERTY layout in the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, having the Path keyboard option on will conflict with (and effectively disable) the Split and One Hand keyboard options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice input is enabled too, as well as handwriting. Furthermore, since this is a Jelly Bean device there's also support for offline voice typing, as long as you have preinstalled the required language packages. We are really pleased with its speed and accuracy, too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Q Theater is your multimedia hub<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The so-called Q Theater is launched by doing a pinch zoom out gesture on your lockscreen, while in landscape orientation. Luckily it has a dedicated shortcut too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has very simple interface - an arc with four shortcut panes matching the display's curve - Gallery, Videos, YouTube and TV. The latter options is available only on the Korean LG G Flex, which is DMB-enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery and video explorers also feature arch-interface and they'll follow the screen curve once you start scrolling them. It's really a nice effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery display your entire collection of pictures ordered by albums, but with not tags or names. The only available option is slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same applies for the video browser too - you get all of your videos, but once you start watching one - you'll get all standard video options - aspect ratio, share, full screen, zoom. It has the same capabilities as the Video app we are going to talk about talk about in a minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YouTube shortcut launches the Android's YouTube app, while the TV shortcut launches LG's TV app utilizing the DMB TV Tuner.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A familiar gallery plus Google Photos on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex uses the same gallery app as the Optimus G, G Pro and G2- in effect, a near stock Android gallery with a few custom touches here and there. It automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored on the phone. By default, images are sorted by albums, but you can sort by location or time as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different sets are tiled neatly across the screen. You can expand or shrink individual albums using a pinch to zoom gesture, making the elements of the grid of photos either really huge or very tiny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once selected, you can view an image close up by pinch zooming or double tapping on the desired area. There is a sliding gallery along the bottom which allows you to quickly browse other images in the album. On the top there are three shortcuts for quickly sharing, editing or deleting the selected photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Share feature offers quick sharing via Email, Google+, Picasa, Memo, Hangouts, MMS, SmartShare, VuTalk, Picasa or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app displays images in full resolution. Zooming and panning involves no lag whatsoever on the G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get the latest version of Google's default Photos app (the default gallery app in Android 4.4 KitKat). Upon opening the app you'll see two tabs - Camera and Highlights.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Camera is a grid of your photos and videos, three on a line. The very first thumb is marked as Folders and will return you a step back to the old Album view, where you can choose to open a different album. The Gallery will always open the Camera album by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Highlights tab has all of your Picasa and Google+ online photos. The Google Photo automatic upload is integrated in the new Gallery app. If you turn it on, your photos will be automatically uploaded to your Google+ profile, but won't be shared with others unless you do it manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a single photo you'll get three shortcuts below the image - Edit, Share and Delete. That's it. The Editor allows you to crop, rotate or add filters to your photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos app has a few hidden goodies that we almost missed. There is a hidden navigation menu pane that is revealed with a swipe from the edge of the screen anywhere in the gallery. You can easily switch Google+ accounts from there, go to Albums, Videos, Photos you are tagged in, all Google+ photos or even the deleted photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an Auto Awesome section. It is something like a smart gallery that combines similar photos and videos in a cool way - it either exports a collage picture or a motion gif. If you like the combination the gallery has made for you, there is a dedicated shortcut to save the new picture in the gallery. Awesome, indeed!</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Capable music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the LG G Flex also looks much like the one inside the Optimus G, G Pro and G2. The interface is simple, easy to use, but still offers a lot functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip songs back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a search menu, if you need to look up the title, artist or the album. After that you can pick where to search - your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search. Flipping the device to landscape mode while on the Now playing screen squeezes in a list of other songs by the same artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets and you can even create custom ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're playing a song it also gets displayed in the notification area, where you can pause and change tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no FM radio on the LG G Flex, probably due to the FM-less nature of the Snapdragon 800 chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the G Flex has a fairly simple interface, giving you just a grid of all the videos on the device. There's an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can, of course, play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization. For each video you've started, the thumbnail gets a tiny clock icon, which shows how far into the video you are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated, yet it's quite powerful. The live preview feature is here - it's a YouTube-like pop up preview of the video above the scrubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get the basics out of the way, the available controls during playback include a scrubber for jumping to various parts of the video along with the standard play/pause and skip buttons. There's a pop-out button at the bottom right corner too, indicating that the app is part of the QSlide functionality on the Optimus UI. LG have implemented MX Player-like controls too - a swipe left or right will move the video forward or backwards, while a swipe up or down will tweak brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video Speed control is available (you can set values from 0.5x up to 2x). There's a lock button too, which hides all controls for pure full-screen viewing. Another cool feature in the video player is Live Zooming. You can zoom in (with the familiar pinch gesture) during playback and some serious magnification is allowed, not just a quick resize or fit to screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex handled everything we threw at it - DivX, XviD, MKV and MP4/MOV up to, and including, 1080p resolution. The AC3 audio codec (among lots of others) is supported, so you don't have to worry about the sound. There are were no issues with higher bitrates and file sizes, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player also supports all popular subtitles formats. You can open subtitles manually in case the subtitle file is not using the same name as the video file. Non-Latin subtitles are supported as well and there are the usual options of choosing the font, color, size, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG took Samsung's pop-up play feature a whole lot further with QSlide. In the latest Optimus UI iteration, LG has added a new batch of apps that take advantage of the functionality. Those include the web browser, Memo, Voice recorder, Calendar, Calculator and more. Furthermore, you can launch any of them from the notification drawer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is amazingly clean but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex did very well in our audio output tests, posting some of the best scores we've seen so far. However it's volume levels were average at best, which prevents us from rating it as the best audio player in business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curved phablet aced the first part of our test, posting perfect scores - the stereo crosstalk reading was particularly imrpessive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's very little degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones - a tad of extra stereo crosstalk sneaks in, but the reading still remains great. The other aspects of the performance are virtually unaffected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The main camera on the LG G Flex has a 13MP sensor that captures photos with a maximum resolution of 4160 x 3120 pixels. It's also capable of shooting 1080p videos at 60fps. There's also a 2.1MP front-facing camera that, too, shoots 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the camera app has been taken from the LG G2 and features virtually the same layout. You get a bar on the right with the still/video toggle, a virtual shutter key and gallery shortcut on the right and a column with four shortcuts on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top shortcut toggles between flash on/off/auto modes, the second one switches between the front and back cameras, the third gives you access to a selection of different camera modes, and the last one is a Settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick between one of twelve shooting modes - Normal, Shot and Clear (erases something from a picture), HDR, Panorama, VR Panorama (Photo Sphere shot), Beauty shot, Dual camera shot, Night scene, Sports, Time Catch shot and Intelligent Auto mode, which automatically selects the right scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Time catch shot feature (also called Time machine camera) snaps a photo, but also records several photos of what happened before you hit the shutter key. You can save any of the photos on that list that you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the photos shot with the LG G Flex is decent, although not quite the best around. Detail is okay, but strangely not as high as it was in the LG G2's photos. However, the white balance is great and colors looking generally very well. The only exception is the greens which tend to be oversaturated at times. Photos tend to be overexposed and there's above average amount of noise in the shadows. It's not too bad though, as the noise of the far less problematic luminance type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The post processing of the photos is pretty mature, applying some adequate sharpening causing little to no halo effects. However, some fine detail does get lost under the effects of noise reduction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took a few HDR shots as well. Disappointingly, the HDR photos that the LG G Flex took were severly lacking in contrast. It's not about trying to squeeze too much dynamic range in a single photo either - the exposures are well selected, but the post processing is quite poor. Hopefully, LG patches the HDR shooting in its following software update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took a shot in a pitch-dark room in order to test the flash. The LG G Flex shot pretty nice photos with plenty of detail. We did a few other tests too and we can confirm the G Flex's flash is great for up to four meters of distance and would do for close-quarter group shots.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera with 1080p@60fps video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex main camera is capable of shooting 1080p videos at both 60 and 30 fps. The 60fps videos are actually shot in 58fps, but we guess that's the best G Flex can do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both videos are stored in MP4 files with a bitrate of 30Mbps for both 1080p@30fps mode 1080p@60fps. Audio is recorded in stereo at 96Kbps and a sampling rate of 48kHz. There are a few interesting modes available in the camcorder - Normal, Dual-recording, Live Effect and Tracking Zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex can record with 720p@30fps with both cameras - that's the Dual recording mode. It looks a lot like video calling with the video feed from one camera filling the screen and the other shown in a small window. You can tap the viewfinder to swap the cameras, even during video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Live Effect videos are shot in 480p and alter faces in real time. There are six types of face altering - big and thin eyes, big and small mouth, big nose and squeeze face. We did try all of them and we did snapshots to give you the idea of the quality and the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last mode is Tracking Zoom. This one uses a small resizable and moveable windows which shows you a zoomed area of the video you are shooting. You can move both the zoomed window and the place you are zooming on. We've prepared a short 720p sample (that's the maximum resolution) for you to check out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is a feature called Audio Zoom. While you are capturing a video you can set the G Flex to zoom on a person or an object and try and capture its sound only. Unfortunately the end results shot with this feature enabled are quite disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What came as a disappointment for us is the fact that even though the LG G Flex is able to capture still shots while recording video, it only produces images with 2 megapixel of resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual videos produced by the G Flex in its regular mode are quite great. The videos are smooth at 30fps and 60fps with great deal of resolved detail, lively colors and excellent contrast. There are no visible defects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this FullHD video sample at 30 fps from the G Flex. You can also download this sample, taken straight from the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Complete connectivity package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex comes with a plethora of connectivity options. For starters, It has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for global roaming, tri-band 3G with HSPA and a dual-band 4G LTE for fast mobile Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is plenty fast with dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac. The Wi-Fi capabilities also include Miracast wireless display protocol, DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and Wi-Fi Hotspot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartShare is a service that lets you control a DLNA network - you can play media from other devices (e.g. NAS) on your phone or play something from the phone onto another device (e.g. a DLNA-enabled TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wi-Fi Direct is a technology, which lets devices connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty of it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to the eventual demise of Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 LE support for short-distance connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board with support for Android Beam. With NFC Beam you can share contacts, URLs, memos, messages, calendar events or even a call request to another NFC-enabled device or a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For wired connections, the LG G Flex relies on its SlimPort - a regular microUSB on the outside, but actually a DisplayPort based interface allowing you to output video and sound to an external display (via an adapter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The USB port has yet another feature - it enables USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (again, there isn't one in the box). This is probably the only way to expand your storage in case the 23GB of free memory isn't enough for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Flex has several ways to push out multimedia but it can do more than that - the IR emitter and QRemote app allow it to control your whole multimedia setup, the TV or a projector, the stereo, disc players and set-top boxes and even the air conditioner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple devices to QRemote and organize them by room so it can easily handle your home theater setup, the TVs in all the rooms at home, as well as the office projector and AC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is accessible from the lockscreen by tapping the Home key, which saves you a click when you want to use the G Flex as a remote. There's no QSlide version of the remote, but you can add it to the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG G Flex can replace multiple remotes and media players (Android has apps for practically all the popular movie and TV show streaming services and the Play Store is one of them to begin with).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remote can be configured to launch automatically when the G Flex connects to your home Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity option worth noting is the 3.5mm audio jack at the bottom of the G Flex. LG has added this cool feature called Plug &amp; Pop. Once you plug in a pair of headphones, a pop-up menu with four shortcuts will appear at the bottom of the screen. The default four assigned shortcuts are Music, Videos, YouTube and Phone. You delete those or you can add even more apps from the dedicated Edit button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great web browsing experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex features the standard Android browser (with some LG modifications on top), but also comes with Chrome preinstalled so you are given a choice right from the start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard browser offers the typical minimalist interface, with the address bar (used both for typing web addresses and initiating web searches) on top and a control bar at the bottom (with options hidden by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling down moves the address bar out of view. The bottom control bar houses the back and forward keys, homepage shortcut as well as new window and bookmarks keys. You can hide that bar by dragging it down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One change in the G2 browser is the button just to the left of the address bar - it puts the browser into QSlide mode, turning it into a floating mini app. You can't switch between tabs in this mode, but the control bar at the bottom is still available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser can save pages for offline reading: they go in the Saved section of your bookmarks, and can be accessed even when you're no longer connected to the internet. The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a history section in addition to the Saved pages list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the so-called Capture Plus setting, which allows you to take a screenshot of the whole web page you've opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find on page, always request desktop site and share page options are available from the advanced menu. If you tap and hold on some text you get the usual markers and select/copy/find/web search/share options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Flex supports double tap and pinch zoom. There's text reflow too - it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you've pinched to zoom in, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text. Text remains legible even at very low zoom levels thanks to the high pixel density.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is also available on the G Flex out of the box. It doesn't support Flash or QSlide, but it will sync tabs (among other things) with the Chrome browser on your computer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The G Flex comes with the usual set of organizing apps and Polaris Viewer 5 document viewer. Unfortunately, you'll have to pay extra for the document editing version of Polaris Office package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you can view documents - Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and PDF files are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Flex could become the essential presenter tool with SmartShare. It can stream content over HDMI (via the SlimPort) or over Wi-Fi (Miracast) and audio over Bluetooth so you can run the presentation from your G Flex. The app can also push content to compatible LG devices with Beam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has a split screen interface - the top part is reserved for the monthly calendar and one on the bottom for the agenda/daily/weekly view. This way you will always have your monthly view visible. The border line between the two sections is not fixed and you can easily move it. You can hide the monthly view completely, but you can't do the same with the other section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar supports QSlide so you can check your schedule while writing an email without having to switch between apps all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to enjoy the calendar full screen without any additional views, just turn the phone landscape. The G Flex is syncable with multiple online calendars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex features an alarm clock application, which lets you set multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time, and ringtone. You can enable application autostartup, so the calendar/email/music player/ tasks/weather app launches when the alarm goes off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a clever feature called puzzle lock, which will make you solve a simple puzzle to disable the alarm. This way you will only be able to stop the ringing when you have properly woken up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Timer, World Clock and Stopwatch features are also part of this app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a useful voice recorder and a nicely touch-optimized calculator. The calculator is QSlide enabled to be always at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app allows you to take notes and add media to them, such as images, audio, or location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notebook is more advanced and lets you create books with multiple pages, add multimedia, draw and eventually export as PDF and email them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a nice animated weather app that can show you the forecast by the hour, for the next four days week.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a QTranslator app, which uses the camera to scan text (a word, line or block at a time) and translate it from one language to another. It's a bit slow and requires a data connection, but it can help you out if you're abroad and don't speak (or read) the language. The OCR (scanning the text) sometimes runs into trouble and produces garbage, but the translations are fairly good by automatic standards - that is to say, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G Flex managed to get GPS lock in about a minute from cold start without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has plenty of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. You can also check out the Play Picks, Apps to Watch, Apps Highlights and Editor's Choice categories on the Home tab for more curated app lists. The Recommended for you list is based on what apps you've installed and what your Google+ friends have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps usually have several screenshots (many even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG SmartWorld app store is also on board. It's similar to the SamsungApps market - there you can find various content and promotions exclusive to LG users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's obviously more than one way to look at the LG G Flex. The sheer shape aside, this phablet is a welcome addition to the ranks, considering the G Pro is getting old and the 6" barrier has long been crossed. The question is though, which end of the seesaw it will end up on. A device with virtually no rivals or one that will never escape the confines of its niche?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG was the first manufacturer to break news of a curved phone in the works, only to be beaten by Samsung to the actual unveiling. Yes, the Galaxy Round made it to the stores before its rival but is still only available in its home market, so the G Flex can get one back with its global release. Anyway, neither of this will probably count for much in what seemingly will continue to be a two-horse race for at least another while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the LG G Flex and the Samsung Galaxy Round were made to wow users and show off their respective makers' cutting-edge technology but they risk being walled in their tower throwing "You're curved wrong" jabs at each other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We think the top-to-bottom curve of the LG G Flex favors landscape use and video watching, while the Galaxy Round's left-to-right curve is interface-driven. We're yet to see the Samsung in action, and we can only speculate but we can safely commend the G Flex on its comfortable hold in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we've seen enough of though is a solid lineup of flagship large-screened smartphones and phablets which are either better equipped, or more compact, or both - and way more affordable too - than these two. It seems the average user will easily pick one among the Galaxy Note 3, LG G2, HTC One Max or the Sony Xperia Z Ultra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung Galaxy Note 3 ? LG G2 ? HTC One Max ? Sony Xperia Z Ultra</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But anyone willing to pay the premium for the privilege of being seen with the latest technology available, will narrow down their meaningful choice to just two devices. The Galaxy Round does have a higher resolution screen - a flagship grade 1080p AMOLED unit, but it lacks the self-healing coating of the G Flex, and is next to impossible to get outside Korea without selling the house. And we'll say it again, the vertically curved G Flex just feels more natural in landscape hold or watching a movie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Round G910S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the LG G Flex isn't without its share of shortcomings: you're tied to the inbuilt memory and the camera has lost OIS. The biggest question mark though is the screen resolution. 720p is quite reasonable, even on a 6" diagonal, and it's an RGB AMOLED unit too. However the actual image quality certainly isn't the best around and there's no getting away from the fact that considerably cheaper devices have way sharper screens on top of equal, or even better, feature sets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, LG have missed an opportunity to make the curved screen count more in how you interact with the device. We love the Q-theater feature but a couple of more creative touches to the interface would've made a welcome difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh well, this is just the first of its kind and maybe we're too hard. To be honest, most of the corners LG needed to cut are an acceptable price for pioneering a flexible screen and battery, and a self-healing finish. There's better value for money to be had elsewhere but it's impossible to put a price tag on imagining the future.</paragraph>
