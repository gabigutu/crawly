			<subsectionTitle>Press conference<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG press conference at the start of MWC 2011 saw the official announcement of the Optimus 3D and Optimus Black smartphones and the 8.9" tablet Optimus Tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 3D and Tab are both boasting dual-core CPUs (though different in nature), while the Optimus Black introduced the new LG NOVA display, which should offer unmatched brightness and energy efficiency.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>MWC booth<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Of course we also stopped by the LG booth at the MWC itself, where we could spend some more quality time with the new devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the photos the new announcements generated quite a lot of interest. Still we managed to fight our way through the crowd and got our geeky hands on all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Understandably, we started with the Optimus 3D. Join us after the break for a load of live images, a hands-on video and a real 3D video captured with its cameras. Plus we've got its impressive Quadrant benchmark performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the 3D screen isn't much to your taste feel free to skip directly to the Optimus Black hands-on or the LG Optimus Pad hands-on.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Optimus 3D hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You might be surprised to learn that the 3D in Optimus 3D actually stands for a couple of things. The first is of course the stereoscopic screen (no glasses required) and the dual cameras that can capture 5 megapixel 3D stills and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Demonstrating the stereoscopic screen on a non-3D display is a pretty hard task, but we are still willing to give it a try. We've used some javascript magic to give you a basic idea on the depth of the 3D effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mind you, there's no need to shake your device furiously to get the 3D thing going. We are just giving you quickly alternating images that represent what each of your eyes is seeing when looking at the Optimus 3D screen. By changing them fast enough an impression of depth is created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And then here's this video showing it in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh and here's the other thing that's 3D about this smartphone. It uses the TI OMAP 4 chipset with Dual-core CPU, Dual-channel and Dual memory. According to LG this should lead to a dramatic improvement in performance compared to even Tegra-powered smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed the Quadrant benchmark result that we got was better than what we achieved with the Optimus 2X and that is with a pre-release unit that obviously still had some issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the body of the device is almost entirely plastic, the 168 g weight gives it a pretty solid feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out this 3D video that we captured with the Optimus 3D. Make sure to watch it in 720p!</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to get an Optimus 3D units with no wires attached, which allowed us to do some better shots of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also decided to give you a tour around the Optimus 3D dedicated 3D menu. It is a nice looking carousel with shortcuts to all 3D-capable apps that come preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we did a quick video demo on the handset UI. We managed to get its camera to force close, but that's not something that should bother you, considering that it's an early pre-release version of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Optimus Black hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus Black lacks the computing muscle and the stereoscopic screen of its bigger brother but it remains a pretty solid smartphone nonetheless. With a 1 GHz CPU and a spanking new NOVA display there?s plenty to like about the Optimus Black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What impressed us most about the LG Optimus Black is undoubtedly its slim waistline. Thickness of 9.2 mm is really impressive to achieve, considering the 4? screen. And yes we know that the Galaxy S II is even slimmer, but Super AMOLED units are generally way thinner than their LCD counterparts.      LG Optimus Black hands-on photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus LG plans to make the Optimus Black an affordable device, so it shouldn?t be pinned against the most capable smartphone around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took a few photos on the alternative color versions of the Optimus Black that LG will be offering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG are keen to promote the new NOVA display that the LG Optimus Black packs. It should bring a far improved brightness and improved battery life. We can personally testify about the brightness thing, but the thing is brightness alone isn?t good for much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Granted, a brighter display is easier to read in the sunlight, but it?s reflectivity that matters the most there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the Black screen excels with ultra-wide viewing angles and good contrast (for the LCD league, that is). If it also delivers on that power-efficiency promise it would certainly make it one of the very good displays out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: here's a short video showing the LG Optimus Black user interface and how you can use the G button on the left side for scrolling, zooming and navigating around.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>NOVA display vs Retina display vs Super AMOLED shootout<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To put things in perspective we decided to do a quick shootout between the LG Optimus Black NOVA display and see how it compares against the best screen technologies currently on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Black screen blacks are only slightly shallower of the Retina shades and, expectedly some way off the Super AMOLED standard. The brightness however is way ahead of the other two and those viewing angles are simply magnificent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s absolutely no color distortion, loss of contrast or any other unwanted side effects even when you look at the NOVA screen from the widest of angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here goes the whole thing captured on video. Even in this elite company the LG NOVA screen holds its ground pretty well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Optimus Pad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 8.9? LG Optimus Pad is an Android 3.0 Honeycomb-running tablet powered by a Tegra 2 chipset, featuring a dual-core 1GHz CPU. The slate also hops on the 3D train but gets off at ?creating content? station. The 1280x768 pixel screen is only capable of displaying 3D content if you wear anaglyph glasses and that?s a thing almost every display can do,</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two cameras on the back still allow 3D stills and videos to be captured. You can then use the HDMI port to stream those to your HDTV or 3DTV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During the press conference the LG speakers took their sweet time mocking the tablets with screens larger or smaller than the 8.9? they chose for the Optimus Pad. According to them any other screen size is going to result in either reduced usability or excessive weight. Now we wouldn?t go as far as to say that one size should fit all in tablets. But we are willing to give the Optimus Pad good points on handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Grabbing the device with one hand is possible, though not always comfortable and if you hold its two sides your thumbs will almost be able to meet halfway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also got a close look at a carrying case that will be available as an accessory for the Optimus Pad. It's really nice and has a hole for the 3D cameras. The ports are easily accessible too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we did a UI demo video for you so you can check out the Optimus Pad performance. We'd say it's pretty great for a pre-release unit. Plus we are really starting to get fond of Android 3.0.</paragraph>
