			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The magical allure of 3D is stronger than ever but manufacturers struggle to meet the demand for better and cheaper ways of 3D capture and viewing. And while glasses may feel alright in the cinema, wearing them to watch TV is perhaps too much to ask of the general public. In the 3D dawn, users are already waiting for a revolution. Surely, there are many reasons why the goggle-free 3DTVs can?t enter our homes yet, but we're lucky to have a piece of that magic in our pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while the other manufacturers are still mulling it over, LG is taking the lead. The first ever mobile phone with a 3D display - the LG Optimus 3D - was announced back in February at the MWC and is now available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In one swift stroke, LG caught the competition off guard. It seems the Optimus 3D holds all the cards right now. There is barely a phone that can compete succesfully on all levels. Although the screen and pair of cameras are the key features, it has everything to become a bestseller even without the 3D trickery. Starting with the dual-core processor and latest-gen graphics, through the capable camera and connectivity package, and the snappy Android Froyo (hopefully, soon to be replaced with Gingerbread).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No more teasing, here is the full feature list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus 3D is far from perfect, but there is no such device out there anyway. The thing of utmost importance here, beside the Optimus 3D being the first of its kind, is that it does an excellent job at it right away. You know most tech pioneering gadgets are nice concepts but rarely turn out polished enough to make a difference. Well, the Optimus 3D is no tech demo. It works as it is supposed to ? there are the 3D menus, the 3D gallery, the 3D pictures and videos and finally, real 3D games. And the best part is that they look awesome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely, there are a few things that might turn out deal breakers for some, but hey, nobody's perfect. If you can forgive the lack of a few features and you're willing to wait until October for the Gingerbread to fix the few performance issues - you should know it will be worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's cut to the chase. Our hardware tour awaits right after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Optimus 3D 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D stretches at 128.8 x 68 x 11.9 mm, which is about what you would expect from a device with a 4.3? screen and is just a few millimeters bigger than its Optimus 2X sibling. It?s not something you can slip in every pocket, but if you are opting for the 3D you already know what to expect. The weight of the handset is 168g is also a bit high for a high-end smartphone, but it?s excusable from a 4.3-inch gadget. In the end, we think the 3D logo will soften any user having troubles with its size though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Everything you need to know about the 3D screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since the 4.3" stereoscopic LCD screen of WVGA resolution seems to be the feature that matters the most here, it is the place where we start our hardware inspection. The LG engineers have come a long way since we first met the handset back in Barcelona and the screen has been improved significantly as far as regular 2D viewing is concerned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 3D screen has very decent viewing angles, and so are the brightness and contrast. Of course, the LCD technology is still no match to the Super AMOLED Plus. Unfortunately, it can?t match the sunlight legibility of the Apple's Retina display either. But wait a second, none of them does goggle-free 3D, do they?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the table with our brightness measurements. You can learn more about the test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The goal of the Optimus 3D display here was to trail the leaders closely and be ready to catch up and even overtake them by playing the trump card. Now the question remains how much is the stereoscopic ace worth to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D mode only works in landscape mode and the glasses-free viewing relies on a parallax-barrier technology. It's an extra screen layer that makes sure each eye sees a different set of pixels, giving a sense of depth. On the downside, each eye gets only half of the screen horizontal resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, to be able to enjoy it fully you will need to find the sweet spot between your eyes and the handset's screen, which is different for everyone. It might seem a bit of a nuisance at first, but you quickly get used to it. A lot of the members of the team were put off at first but some saw the 3D images nice and crisp right off the bat. So we guess it?s a physiological thing to a great extent too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other thing that you have to get used to is there?s no way to share the 3D goodness of the screen. Only one person at a time can watch the 3D effect. Looking at the screen at an angle, gets you a regular 2D image at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That aside, the 3D effects itself are pretty impressive, even more so if you are a fan of the technology - you know, the kind of guy who would go and watch any mind-numbing movie they threw at you, just because it's in 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now the 3D visualization is only available in applications that are specially designed for 3D viewing, but those are in no short supply on the Optimus 3D (we'll get back to them later). The regular Android interface looks just like on any other smartphone, you?ve seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, given it's the first attempt we've seen at a mobile glasses-free 3D screen for mass sonsumption, the Optimus 3D display does pretty well. We were pleasantly surprised and we believe the technology has a future in smartphones. Or at least the potential is there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite its entirely plastic construction, the LG Optimus 3D is a pretty good-looking handset. The front is a well-done mix of faux brushed metal (the two plastic pieces at the top and bottom), touch-sensitive keys and an ample LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back has the LG?s trademark styling with a metal stripe on soft rubbery plastic. We liked that back in the Optimus 2X and a few months later we're glad to report we haven't tired of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If anything takes away some points from the Optimus 3D design, it'd be the thickness. Now, we do realize it's probably impossible to squeeze all that functionality (including two cameras and a stereoscopic screen) in anything slimmer so we are not blaming LG here. However, the fact remains that, when placed next to one of its slimmer competitors, the Optimus 3D loses some of its appeal. It simply looks and feels chubbier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The increased thickness also has a slightly negative effect on handling. It's harder to wrap your hand around the Optimus 3D and have the entire surface of the screen within comfortable reach. It's not too bad though, and the result is most probably worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that we?ve taken the 3D screen out of the way, we can continue our tour of the LG Optimus 3D externals. Just above the display, you can notice a video-call camera, right next to the proximity sensor and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four capacitive keys are on the opposite end of the front. The Menu, Home, Back and Search keys are haptic enabled and brilliantly backlit, and have the usual Android functionality upon a long press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the LG Optimus 3D hosts the HDMI and microUSB ports, neatly covered by plastic caps. The lids might get in the way a bit, but it's a price you have to pay for keeping dust and moist away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated 3D key is on the opposite side of the smartphone, exactly on the spot usually reserved for a shutter key. The volume rocker is on that same side too. Both keys are a bit too flat and placed on the sloping rear half of the phone so pressing them is a bit tricky, but you do get used to it eventually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D key launches the 3D interface that LG cooked up for their latest smartphone. It also makes a point in a way that this particular part of the UI is quite important to LG (you know, like a mini-banner).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the LG Optimus 3D hosts the power/screen lock key, the second microphone (the smartphone records videos with stereo sound) and the 3.5mm audio jack there. The power key has the same problem as the volume rocker and the 3D knob.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary microphone is located at the bottom of the device. Naturally, this is the one that is used when you make phone calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we turn the LG Optimus 3D around to meet the dual 5 megapixel camera lens combo with a tiny LED flash squeezed in between. The loudspeaker grill is around too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the battery cover, but fortunately it is hot-swappable. It handles all kinds of memory cards currently available so you can easily expand the Optimus 3D storage by up to 32 GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing of notice under the back panel is the 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery. It?s said to last for up to 100 hours of stand-by or up to 4 hours of talk time, not quite impressive numbers. Unfortunately, we can?t comment on the Optimus 3D real-life battery performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the Optimus 3D seems pretty great. The smartphone seems sturdy and its exterior durable enough to last for quite some time without losing much of its appeal. A big and heavy phone, not particularly slim either, it does look impressive and handles reasonably well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3D apps aside, the user experience that the LG Optimus 3D offers is hardly any different from what you'd get from the Optimus 2X. Still we'll go through the LG home-backed launcher in case you missed that review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here it is on video, for those who haven?t played around with an Optimus before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sad part is that the LG smartphone portfolio is still stuck with Android 2.2 Froyo, despite the fact that 2.3 Gingerbread has been available for more than half an year now. Since Android 2.3 Gingerbread is not such a dramatic improvement over Froyo, we are willing to let it go for now as long as LG promises to step up its game and deliver the update quickly (minor or not, it's always better to have the update).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s now a view mode similar to the HTC Sense leap view, where you see all your homescreen panes in one place and pressing one of them zooms in on it. This view mode is triggered by the familiar pinch zoom gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available number of homescreen panes can be customized too from that view mode with any number between 1 and 7. A button lets you select any of your homescreen panes as the default one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the LG Optimus 3D screen and are visible on both the homescreen and in the app drawer. You get Phone, Contacts, Messaging and a Home/applications button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a new twist to the way you place stuff on the homescreen. Upon a tap-and-hold on the display ? or by hitting the add button in the menu ? gridlines appear on the screen and the four docked icons get replaced by a taskbar with widgets, shortcuts, folders and wallpapers to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG customizations continue with the app drawer. You get not one, but three different options for its styling ? a side scrollable horizontal grid, a vertical grid that you scroll upwards and downwards and List view. In vertical grid mode you get icons grouped by categories, which you are free to change however you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area, one of the Android strong points, has a few tweaks as well ? it?s got five switches that toggle sound, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and auto network data. There are also music player controls docked here. All this is quite convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D uses only two motion gestures - mute for the ringer and snooze for the alarm. The Optimus 2X had several more and the Optimus Black even had a dedicated button - it's odd that LG decided to remove the motion gestures, but we're not really sad to see them gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now we move on to what you really came for - the 3D Space app, which is the hub for all the stereoscopic action on the Optimus 3D.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3D space is where it gets exciting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you didn't figure it out from the name, then you should know that 3D is very important for the LG Optimus 3D. That's why the company developed the 3D space app, which brings the shortcuts to all the stereoscopic apps together in a common hub. The 3D button on the side of the Optimus 3D launches just that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's more for show than it is actually useful but it has cool 3D interface with nice animations for each of the categories. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to demonstrate the 3D action with our camera, but here's what we came up with. Here's some animated GIF magic to give you a basic idea of the 3D effect you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Mind you, there's no need to shake your device furiously to get the 3D thing going. We are just giving you quickly alternating images that represent what each of your eyes is seeing when looking at the Optimus 3D screen. By changing them fast enough, you get a slight resemblance of the real-life effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3D Guide is a manual that will teach you how to create, view and share 3D content. You get a brief tutorial on each of the subjects, but it should be enough to teach you everything there is to know about 3D on the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll show you more of the 3D Space as we go along the review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dual-core 1GHz processor made the Optimus 3D a prime candidate for our battery of synthetic benchmarks. It uses a TI OMAP 4430 chipset with two Cortex-A9 cores and a PowerVR SGX540 GPU and 512MB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi showed the LG Optimus 3D is on par with the Optimus 2X (no surprise here, both use Cortex-A9 cores), but put the Samsung Galaxy S II is slightly ahead and the HTC Sensation - slightly behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack has been updated and now features single and multithreaded modes. We ran the multithreaded mode, but unfortunately results aren?t comparable to those of the old version. So, we retested the Galaxy S II and Optimus 2X, but we didn?t have a Sensation to use in this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the LG Optimus 3D surprisingly came out ahead of the 2X and closed on the Galaxy S II. That's pretty impressive, considering the S II runs at 1.2GHz, which should theoretically give it a 20% advantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant puts the Optimus 3D ever so slightly ahead of the Sensation, but behind the Galaxy S II. Since Quadrant does file system benchmarks, the Optimus 3D should get a boost when it moves to Gingerbread (and its faster Ext4 file system).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser benchmarks show that LG have done a very good job at optimizing the software. The CPU-heavy SunSpider shows that the Optimus 3D and 2X share a close second to the Galaxy S II, while the Sensation lags behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark, which tests the speed of the HTML engine as well as JavaScript performance reaffirms this, putting the Optimus 3D very close to the fastest of the bunch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A social phonebook with an agenda<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook displays all the contacts in a list ordered alphabetically and there is an alphabet scroll on the right. There?s also a regular search bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed ? First Name, Last Name or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phone book from getting overcrowded ? you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, Twitter contacts and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact is displayed with a contact photo and name ? a tap on the photo brings up the quick contacts keys. You can use those to call the contact, send them a message or email or view their profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a single contact uses a tabbed interface. The first tab is Info ? and it shows all available info for the contact with handy one-tap shortcuts for calling, messaging and so on. The next tab is History, which shows the communication history with the contact (calls, SNS updates, everything).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third tab is Photos, which show the contacts online albums and finally, there's the Agenda tab, which displays calendar events that this contact is involved in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can join contacts so that if you have a contact added to multiple services, all the data from them is pooled in one place. When you tap Join, the phonebook will suggest a contact based on name and it?s right most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can manually pick another one, if it?s wrong, of course. When you add a new account, the phone will offer to import all, only some of the contacts or only those it already has in the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is mostly unchanged. You have all the types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right - clicking it adds another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is clever and groups some of the calls, e.g. 3 missed calls from the same contact on the same day. A number next to the contact name shows the number of events. It?s a great space saving feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus One 3D showed good signal reception even in areas of poor coverage. The in-call quality though is good but rather quiet even at the loudest setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer shows a virtual phone keypad that lets you dial a number. Smart Dial is available and works like a charm ? it searches both numbers and names. Only one matching contact is displayed, but if you tap the down arrow button, the rest show up as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our traditional loudspeaker test and the LG Optimus 3D scored a Good mark. Depending on your choice of ringtone, you shouldn?t miss any calls in all but the loudest environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more about the testing procedure here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Rich messaging capabilities<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D can handle all common types of messages with ease - SMS, MMS and email. Email support is excellent with support for Exchange out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted, spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts. If you do add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy. Too bad there?s no conversation-style view like in Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two types of on-screen keyboard you get with the LG Optimus 3D ? the phone dialpad and the on-screen QWERTY keyboard. The QWERTY is available in both portrait and landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard looks a little iPhone-like but the good news is that it?s very good too. Portrait mode is quite accurate for text input and the landscape mode makes things even better.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery and 3D gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D comes with both the standard Android gallery and a custom 3D Gallery app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard gallery is great and organizes every image and video into neat folders. It supports pinch zooming and sorting by date. There are tons of options for a picture ? you can crop or rotate it directly in the gallery. The Send feature offers quick sharing via Facebook, Twitter, Picasa, Email apps or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming and panning is fast and smooth, but there?s a perceptible lag until the actual panning (or zooming) starts, which is slightly annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Actually, there are some changes to the standard gallery - it recognizes which photos are 3D and puts a small "3D" logo on their thumbnails. It also sports a 3D toggle when viewing those images individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the 3D Gallery app, which was intended solely for viewing 3D photos and videos, so you'd better use that. It offers a couple of cool interface modes and it's certainly good looking and smoothly running, but it's not particularly functional. In fact, truth be told, it?s there solely for the show-off. Besides that, it?s a pain to navigate, especially since there?s no way of sorting the content by date or type and even the simple, but useful grid view is missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A useful option when looking at a single image, is to choose the depth of the 3D effect. We didn't see the need to move it from its default maximum position but changing it might improve the viewing experience for others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player is the polished player we first got on the Optimus 2X. It can do the usual filtering by album and artist and you have alphabet search and regular search for finding songs quicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip a song or go back to the previous one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a menu to search ? for the title, the artist or the album title. After that you can pick where to search ? your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets available, which work only with headphones. You can't create custom equalizers, but the selection of presets is very wide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone on its side reveals a cool wall of all the albums you have in your music collection. Tap on an album and you?ll see a list of all songs from it. There?s an alphabet scroll at the bottom of the screen to make finding albums faster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the LG Optimus 3D didn't do much better in our audio quality test than the LG Optimus 2X before it. This means that it works well with an active external amplifier, but doesn't take headphones all too well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So when you use the Optimus 3D with your car or home stereo you can rely on some impressively clean (though hardly the loudest) audio output. This is easy to see from the readings in the table below, which are just great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play, however, the stereo crosstalk takes a really serious hit - it gets relegated from excellent to one of the worst we have seen. At least the rest of the readings (volume levels included) are almost unaffected, which is somewhat of a consolation. Still, we wouldn't rate the Optimus 3D anything higher than average on this occasion.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Portable movie theater near you, in 3D<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a fairly simple interface ? it?s just a list of all the videos on the devices. There?s an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that?s about it. 3D videos are marked with a "3D" icon, to make them more apparent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated either ? there?s the scrubber to skip to some part of the video along with the play/pause button and next and previous buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an extra button to lock the screen during playback and there's a 3D toggle. While in 3D mode, there's an option to adjust the 3D depth, just like in the gallery. By the way, enabling 3D on a 2D video would enable software conversion, which creates a pretty passable 3D effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D handled just about every video file we threw at it ? the usual 3GP and MP4 stuff along with WMV and AVIs using DivX and XviD. 1080p videos played well too as did long files (nearly two hours) and large files too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 3D even played MKV files ? a very common container for HD content, which really sold us on the video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles worked fine too and you even have settings for font and size. You can toggle subtitles on and off, but there?s no option to manually load subtitles (so the subtitle filename has to match the video filename).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some issues that need to be addressed though ? only English subtitles worked, any non-Latin characters would cause the subtitles to fail (even Spanish subtitles). Using UTF encoding didn?t help either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, to change the HDMI output resolution settings, you?ll have to access the main Android settings - you can choose from 1080p, 720p and SD resolutions, so even old TVs (e.g. ones that support only up to 1080i) should work.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two 5MP cameras do okay<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus 3D comes with a dual 5MP megapixel shooter, which sounds pretty decent on paper. The maximum resolution for 3D shots however is limited to 3MP, which we found odd.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a positive note, the camera user interface is convenient, though many of the important settings are inside the extended settings menu, so they take a while to toggle. The 2D interface is standard LG camera UI, except for the 3D toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In 3D mode, you get some extra dials - like a slider to adjust the 3D depth and there's 3D focus mode too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features are pretty good with face detection, continuous autofocus, touch focus and geo-tagging on board along with preset scenes and effects. The shot-to-shot time is about a second for both 2D and 3D modes - a good improvement as some recent LG phones we tried took some good 2-3 seconds between the shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key that's positioned where the shutter key usually is actually a 3D toggle. There's no option to turn it into a shutter key (at least not with the stock software).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a 2D 5MP shooter, the LG Optimus 3D isn't very impressive. Noise levels are kept in check but only at the price of most of the fine detail. Contrast is low in some photos and colors often come up a bit dull.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dropping down to 3MP for the 3D shots doesn?t really improve performance, 3D shots suffer from the same drawbacks as the 2D ones. Note that depending on how you view photos on another device (e.g. TV), there might be some more reduction in quality (mostly for non-3D TVs and anaglyph glasses).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some 2D camera samples from the Optimus 3D so you can judge the image quality for yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the 3D samples. You should use the Wiggle view mode (available as a switch in our pop-up viewer) to get a basic idea of the 3D effect without the need for glasses or a 3D screen. If you happen to have any of the supported anaglyph glasses at hand, you might want to go for the Anaglyph view mode too. Interlaced 3D screens are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you may wish to download the jps files on your PC and open them with any JPS viewer that you want. Those are the untouched 3MP camera samples straight from the LG Optimus 3D.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve included the LG Optimus 3D camera samples over at our Photo Compare Tool. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 3D does okay in synthetic tests, though the oversharpening is very obvious (first poster). The noise reduction on the other hand smudges highly-detailed portions of the image (grass and gravel in second poster). Colors are not as lively as other cameras would have made them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HD videos enter the third dimension<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D records video in two modes - 2D and 3D. In 2D, the phone can go up to 1080p resolution at 30fps, but as with the still camera, the 3D mode is a peg lower in resolution - 720p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera UI looks just like the camera UI. Here you get the same 3D depth slider, the 3D focus mode plus an image stabilization option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video quality, much like the still image quality, isn't anything to get excited about. 1080p videos are shot in MP4 files and the bitrate is just over 8Mbps, which sounds quite good. None of the 30 frames per seconds shot by the camera are repeated either so the videos are smooth. The frames image quality however is not that good - they have a soft, overprocessed look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>720p videos are shot in MP4 files too, with a little over 6Mbps bitrate and no repeated frames. Frames here look sharper, with more fine detail. If you stretch both a 1080p and a 720p video to the same size (i.e. on the same TV), the results would be hard to tell apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 3D constantly adjusts the exposure during capturing (a nice thing), but it does so too quickly - and videos appear to 'pulsate' (which can be downright annoying.)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D videos are limited to 720p resolution and they use the same 6Mbps MP4 recipe as their 2D counterparts. However, due to how videos are stored (the left and right frame are put side by side into a single 1280 x 720) frame, they have only half the horizontal resolution. This worsens the overall result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the video samples. We have untouched 2D and 3D samples or you can check out the samples we uploaded to YouTube below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Get the 2D 1080p@30fps (9s, 9.4MB) and 2D 720p@30fps (10s, 7.6MB) untouched videos here and a 3D 720p@30fps (11s, 8.1MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>YouTube supports a wide array of 3D viewing methods, which makes it a great option for sharing 3D videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't forget to click 1080p and go into full screen mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the 3D YouTube video samples - there's an option to adjust the 3D viewing method to match whatever you have (from fancy monitors to simple anaglyph glasses). And don't forget to choose 720p.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D is among the first phones in our Video Compare Tool database that can record 1080p. The Tool?s page includes a quick walkthrough on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our video quality comparisons show that the practical resolution in videos is not very good. The resolution chart (the 3rd one) shows that the Optimus 2X has much more detail in its 1080p videos (which aren?t that good anyway). Still, the Optimus 3D produces videos with a smooth bitrate and does well in the dark.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good connectivity with HDMI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity options that the LG Optimus 3D has to offer includes quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for world-wide connectivity and tri-band 3G with 14.4Mbps/5.76Mbps for faster mobile Internet in areas with supported 3G bands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 3D has Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 3.0 (no HS profile) with A2DP and a microUSB port for local data transfers. USB tethering and Wi-Fi hotspot options are available for sharing the phone's data connection. You can secure the Wi-Fi hotspot using WPA2 or leave it open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For multimedia connectivity, you have two choices - wired (HDMI) and wireless (DLNA). Using the SmartShare app you can control a DLNA network ? you can play media from other devices (e.g. NAS) on your phone or play something from the phone on another device (e.g. DLNA-enabled TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Custom web browser is good, has Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android browser is one of the best available on a mobile device ? put it on a powerful hardware like the LG Optimus 3D has and it provides flawless experience. LG has also taken the time two tweak the UI a bit, but the underlying rendering engine is the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser now has a permanent row of shortcuts at the bottom with five buttons - forward and back, tabs, new tab and settings. It eats into the screen real estate but you have to remember that the Optimus 3D has a 4.3" screen, not just a 4" screen like the Optimus 2X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Settings icon is rarely used and shouldn?t stay there permanently. The back key is not terribly useful too, considering there's a hardware button for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu key brings up some more options - like text selection and find on page, but there's also Read It Later integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 3D supports double tap zoom and pinch zoom. There?s text reflow too ? it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you?ve zoomed in using pinch zoom, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs are managed with an attractive card interface. The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history. Read it later also has a tab here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole browsing experience is excellent ? there?s no lagging and the 4.3? WVGA screen offers plenty of room even for complex web pages. Text remains crisp regardless of the zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 3D browser is Flash-enabled that means you can use the desktop YouTube and other video sharing sites and also play Flash games. Flash games ran smoothly, but videos were another matter - 720p lagged, which isn't acceptable on a dual-core 1GHz smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of YouTube, you can also use the YouTube 3D app. Just as it sounds, the app is exactly the same thing as the regular YouTube Android app, except that it directly hooks up to YouTube?s 3D channel that?s full of good and not so good 3D content.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Brilliant office document editor, good organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D comes with the usual set of organizing apps and there?s a preloaded document viewer and editor (well sort of).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is Polaris Office and it?s one of the most feature-rich mobile editors we?ve seen. Starting with the basics, you can, of course, view documents ? Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and PDF files too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing offers almost a full set of options ? text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables (that?s a first). If you?re editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, merge cells and so on. Even creating a full PowerPoint presentation is possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can do practically anything with the app ? it?s better than the other mobile editors we?ve tested, even better than the Windows Phone 7 one (which actually had many editing limitations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app doubles as a file manager and also integrates with Box.net.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a voice recorder, which might be pretty useful for making audio notes and a nicely touch-optimized calculator.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>3D games and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 3D apps are an important part of the Optimus 3D software - so much so, in fact, that they have their own category in the menu. Using 3D Games &amp; Apps you can get a list only of the 3D-enabled apps on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the Optimus 3D came with four 3D-enabled games. That's not a lot of content, but it?s more than what most Android handsets deliver - and these four are all with 3D effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The games in question are Lets Golf 2, Nova, Asphalt 6 and Guiliver's Travels so there should be something for everyone. Much like the gallery, each of the games has a toggle to set the depth of the 3D effect and you can even get rid of it all together if you feel like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a pretty complete package if you think about it, though some 3D-enabled apps would have been nice.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Extensive Facebook and Twitter integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D features great SNS integration. Both Facebook and Twitter contacts can be added to the phonebook and you can link those to existing phone contacts ? in fact, the first time you create an account, the phone will offer to import the contacts from that social network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s clever too ? you can import all contacts, manually select which ones to import, or just those who match people in your phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you link a contact with their Facebook or Twitter, their status updates will go into the History tab of their contact info and the Photo tab will show their online albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook app lets you read news feeds, post messages on people?s walls, browse their profiles and so on. You can of course post status updates and including a photo is very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Twitter app is also feature complete. You can manage your profile and the list of people you follow, plus read tweets from others. The @me section will help you find tweets directed at you easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you receive a new message, it will appear in the notification area just like regular SMS messages do. You can set it to notify you when there?s a new @me message or direct message.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market lacks 3D screen enabled apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D is running Android 2.2 Froyo and has a WVGA screen, which should give it access to the majority of apps in the market. However, there's a notable lack of apps that support 3D screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is worrying - we found promises of 3D-enabled apps being developed, but nothing actually inside the market. And even if all those apps are eventually entered into the Market, you'd still be looking at a very limited selection of 3D-enabled apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You need to go to LG World for that. Even there, pickings are very slim and there's no simple way to view only the 3D-enabled apps. Searching for "3D" yields apps that are 3D (as in 3D graphics) and ones that are 3D (as in stereoscopic). Wikitude 3D was really the only app we found and installed that supported the Optimus 3D's screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a shortcut in the menu called 3D games, which takes you to a website where you can purchase some games that support a 3D screen. We counted six games at the time of this writing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the regular Android Market works as usual. It shows featured apps on top and below them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google maps and GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 3D comes with a built-in GPS receiver. It got an accurate GPS lock in about a minute and a half. If you need only general location (within 100-150 meters) for location-based services, you can use Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network positioning.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Maps 5.3 is part of the standard Android package. It uses vector maps, which are smaller and download faster but also support cool 3D views. You can use the two finger camera tilt and camera rotate gestures to look around (though 3D building are not available everywhere).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no switch to use the 3D capabilities of the display either, but maybe some industrious dev will fill that void.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Maps Navigation option is available too ? but only for supported countries. The new version features offline rerouting. That is, it will cache the needed maps to navigate you to where you?re going and even if you deviate from your course, it will be able to calculate a new route even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Street View mode is supported and will do the well-known compass trick, which is like taking a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Like it or not, the 3D technology is entering our world more rapidly that the tech evolution is able to handle. Today we have 3D cinemas, home 3DTVs, glasses-free 3D screens at the malls or even street billboards imitating 3D. Wearing glasses is no fun anymore so we?re glad to see that when LG went on to make a 3D phone, they made it right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here we are, witnessing a revolution with the first ever 3D smartphone - the Optimus 3D. There?s hardly another 3D handset to match its 3D capabilities (even the CDMA HTC EVO 3D). Yes, you surely can find a match or even better smartphone, but not a 3D one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one thing that was bothering us during the months between the announcement and the release - the 3D viewing quality - turned out quite nice. The 3D display looks and feels better than the EVOS 3D's and playing 3D content could be quite fun. The 3D tech is not so advanced to work in full resolution or to work for more than one person, but it?s still an awesome feature even at this stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the smartphone part is concerned - there are probably better performers out there, but none of them has the 3D magic, right? Still, the Optimus 3D is an excellent smartphone, although a big one, and if you could give LG a little time to work on the Gingerbread update (not that the Froyo is bad, it just still fails to properly use the dual-core processors), you won't be disappointed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC EVO 3D over LG Optimus 3D<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you can see, the LG Optimus 3D is much better for creating and consuming 3D content than the HTC's EVO 3D, while the EVO 3D is better at doing your regular smartphone heavy lifting. If the 3D stuff is the thing of most importance, then you have no choice but the Optimus 3D. On the other side, if you want it just as another cool feature on your phone - then you should go for the EVO 3D. And honestly, the coolness of the 3D effect wears off rather fast once you get used to it. Not to mention there aren?t much ways to share your 3D images and videos online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC EVO 3D</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing - the EVO 3D pre-orders are currently positioned at ?700, which at least ?220 more than the Optimus 3D. But that?s typical of HTC handsets at launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's jump on the more regular high-end smartphones and see what's on offer. In the same price segment you can find powerful smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S II, the HTC Sensation and the Motorola Atrix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II is an excellent piece of kit - it's powered by a 1.2GHz dual-core processor, the 4.3" screen is a SuperAMOLED Plus and the chipset (that is CPU, GPU and RAM) edges the competiton in most benchmarks. It's also amazingly thin and light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9100 Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Atrix is based on the Tegra 2 chipset with 1GHz dual-core CPU and has a qHD screen. It has a 5MP/720p camera but it?s the extra docks that make it unique, especially the laptop one that adds a full size QWERTY keyboard and an 11.6-inch screen. It has a few things that might turn deal-breakers such as the older Android Froyo, but as we said, it has an ace in the hand with that dock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola Atrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sensation is the 3D-less sibling of the EVO 3D, but it's as impressive as its gets. Featuring the same hardware as the EVO 3D, the Sensation has better performance than the Optimus 3D. There?s also the HTC Sense v.3.0 UI masking the Android Gingerbread and an 8 megapixel snapper. It's currently one of the best smartphones out there and costs the same as the Optimus 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Sensation</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Optimus 2X should also be mentioned as an alternative,. It's a lot cheaper than the Optimus 3D and is based on the Tegra 2 hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus 2X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D or not 3D - that's the question. If the answer is yes, then the Optimus 3D has no alternative for now. The best thing is that the device is more than reasonably priced and offers some really awesome features for the money. Technology is entering the third dimension, no two ways about it. LG has front row seats for the most impatient.</paragraph>
