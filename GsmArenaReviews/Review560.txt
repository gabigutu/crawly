			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Meizu has unlocked yet another achievement with the m2 note - to deliver yet another amazing phablet with an unbelievably attractive price tag. While others sacrifice a lot to keep the budget, Meizu somehow manages to push the limits way beyond our understandings of the possible and breaks the value for money record once again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 note was a fantastic package for the price. It pretty much established the baseline for how to get the best out of a smartphone on a shoestring budget. The one we had others compared to. So, we're quite keen to meet the successor, the Meizu m2 note, which too will have to stand up to comparison. Wider LTE compatibility, a microSD card slot and Android Lollipop isn't a bad way to start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m2 note uses the next iteration of the MediaTek chip, the MT6753. It's a different configuration though - the octa-core Cortex-A53 processor runs at 1.3GHz, the GPU is Mali-T720MP3 and there is the same 2GB of RAM. This means the Meizu m2 note has a little less processing power and an inferior GPU, so this is something to look closely at in the benchmark chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note keeps most of the good stuff though. You get the same IGZO screen, the dependable 13MP main camera and the smart 5MP selfie cam, there is a big enough battery, and the finish is now matte, not glossy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu addressed a couple of our concerns with the m1 note and now the m2 note offers wider LTE support and a memory card slot. The matte finish is well appreciated too. The non-removable battery has solid capacity, while we are yet to determine the performance impact of the new chipset configuration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we are ready to unpack the Meizu m2 note and start exploring. We'll be back right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Meizu m2 note<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note retail box is absolutely identical to m1 note's - it's big and not too generously filled. A 2A charger and a microUSB cable are the only amenities in what's clearly a base trim package. An optional pair of headphones will be bundled as well in select markets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Meizu m2 note 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new m2 note brings just a few changes, most of them inside. So it should be no surprise the m2 note has the same footprint as its predecessor, 150.9 x 75.2 x 8.7 mm. The only minor difference is the phone's weight. The m2 note has added an extra 4g to tip the scales at 149g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note is quite easy to sum up in terms of exterior - it's a m1 note with matte finish. Simple as that. The body is easily recognizable for its familiar rounded edges and unfeigned fondness for the iPhone. Meizu have obviously continued to pay attention to Apple's latest designs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire front is covered by a piece of either Asahi Dragontrail Glass or Dinorex T2X-1, while the non-removable rear panel is as neat and simple as it can be. We welcome the switch from glossy to matte plastic for improving both the grip and aesthetes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only novelty in the Meizu m2 note is the Home key - it's now a proper hardware button, bigger, and with a silver frame accent. What's even better, the Home button keeps its capacitive sensitivity as well - you can touch it for Back or press it for Home (takes you to your default homescreen). Quite clever indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note benefits from much improved grip and is a pleasure to handle, thanks to the matte finish on the rear. Fingerprints are not an issue either. While the 5.5" smartphone is by no means compact, single-handed use is fairly comfortable in certain tasks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the 5.5" IGZO display we find the earpiece, a couple of sensors and the 5MP selfie camera. Below the display is the new hardware key, which combines Back and Home functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Meizu m2 note features the volume rocker and the Power/Lock key. We are more comfortable with a right-mounted lock key and we had some hard time getting used to the button's position on the m2 note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right is the ejectable tray, which can either accommodate a nano-SIM and a microSD card or a pair of nano-SIM cards. It's up to you to choose what you'll be using the second compartment for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary mic are on the top of the m2 note, while the bottom has the microUSB port with the primary mic and the loudspeaker grille on each side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back, the Meizu m2 note has the 13MP main camera and a two-tone LED flash.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the Meizu m2 note is absolutely the same 5.5" 1080p unit the m1 note has. It's indeed a joy to look at, the colors are nicely saturated and the viewing angles are very good. The IGZO panel is made by Sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolution is definitely a treat for the price and more than sufficient at 1080p. 403ppi is sharp enough and you wouldn't really tell the difference to any QHD screen on the market unless you're looking at some really small fonts. Here's the m2 note display matrix - it has a standard RGB arrangement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our display measurements revealed the m2 note's screen isn't as bright as its predecessor's. The m1 note's screen is about 20% brighter than the new unit found on the m2 note. The blacks are deeper though, which could be explained by the dimmer screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the display may not be as bright as before, 470 nits is still a very respectable brightness level and the contrast ratio is excellent. Dropping the brightness slider down to 50% lowers the actual brightness to 180 nits and deepens the blacks to produce even better contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Somehow Meizu managed to lower the screen's sunlight legibility even more. While the m1 note did average in this test, the m2 note is sunlight readability is just poor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Powered by a 3,100mAh battery, the Meizu m1 note managed an overall rating of 65 hours of battery life, and we hoped the m2 note would do better thanks to the Lollipop optimizations under the hood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed it posted very solid numbers in the 3G call test and web browser endurance, but did rather poorly when it comes to video playback. The m2 note slightly improves the average standby performance of its predecessor, which boosts the overall endurance score up to 69 hours. This means the Meizu m2 note will last two and a half days and then some, if you do an hour each of calling, web browsing and video playback daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m2 note offers three battery modes - power-saving (four CPU cores only), balanced (six CPU cores) and performance (all eight CPU cores). We tested it in Performance mode, so you may be able to squeeze even more from the battery when the m2 note is running in Power-Saving mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note comes with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE support, tri-band 3G with HSDPA and HSUPA, as well as Cat.4 LTE support. It's compatible with more bands than m1 note, which may be a sign that Meizu is planning wider availability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m2 note has dual-SIM, dual-standby functionality - 3G and LTE are supported only on SIM1, while SIM2 can tap into 2G GSM networks only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m2 note has dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, so you can play media (photos, videos, music) from DLNA-enabled devices or push content from your phone to a DLNA-compatible TV or music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 4.0 is also enabled, complete with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port supports USB host so you can attach USB flash drives or connect peripherals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also stream your display via the Wireless Display feature (Miracast).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GPS and GLONASS support is enabled. There's no FM Radio, IR port or NFC on the Meizu m2 note, there is no wired TV-out option either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Flymed Lollipop<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note comes with the custom-made Flyme OS, now in its 4.5 installment. It's based on the latest Android Lollipop 5.1 and it takes after its Chinese siblings and has a one-level interface with only homescreen and no app drawer, similarly to Apple's iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen on the Meizu m2 note is a pretty simple affair. You drag upwards to unlock and have the option of securing it with a passcode or an unlock pattern. There are no shortcuts on the lockscreen, but and you use left and right swipes to launch apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gesture wake up is available - you can use pre-defined gestures to launch different apps while your phone is asleep - double tap to wake and swipe to unlock work by default, but you can also use swipe down, or other gestures such as Z, M, U, W, among others to launch apps of your choosing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Holding down the home button will lock back the device. You can also assign a number of functions to tapping the home button - you can set it go back in the UI, close an app or go back to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen is simpler still. You get two panes by default but you can add more later on. The homescreen gathers all of your app icons and you can add widgets into the mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area pulls down the whole way. You get a set of five circular toggles for various settings and you can expand them with a swipe down or with the dedicated virtual button in the top right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the notification area is a basic list or expandable, actionable notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between tasks is done with a pull up menu from the bottom of the screen. It looks like iOS 6 in a way but works differently - you have to swipe apps up or down to dismiss them. There is also an option to pin an app (tap and hold) and it will stay always in recent apps at the state you closed it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can customize the UI with various themes. There are some preloaded but you can browse the App Center for more - some of them are paid but there are many free and a lot to choose from. There's also a variety of built in wallpapers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a Do Not Disturb mode that will block notifications and calls and you can choose a white list of numbers that can get through. It can be scheduled to run at specific time intervals or be set manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more option - Scheduled Power On and Off - you can setup your Meizu m2 note to shut down and boot up at a specific time on specific week days - just like alarms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flyme OS can be tough to get around at first but once you've gotten your bearings it becomes a treat to work with. Meizu is keeping things as simple as possible and everything works seamlessly without any hiccups.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note has a 1080p display and runs on a MediaTek MT6753 chipset with eight Cortex-A53 cores ticking at 1.3GHz and Mali-T720MP3 GPU. This means it has less-powerful CPU than its predecessor. The GPU is also of the lesser kind, but offers three GPU cores instead of two as was the case with the Mali-T760MP2 in m1 note. The RAM stays the same at 2GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Given the specs at hand we expected the Meizu m2 note to perform slightly below the original m1 note and we were about right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eight Cortex-A53 cores within the Meizu m2 note are becoming quite a common configuration these days. The first generation m1 note used the same processor, but it was more powerful at 1.7GHz. This 400 MHz worth of a difference has put an immense gap between the CPU performance of the first and second Meizu note. The m2 note performs similarly to the recently released Huawei P8lite, while the m1 note leads our chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 5 compound benchmark takes in consideration the GPU and memory performance, too. This explains the 7,000 points difference between the more powerful m1 note. The m2 note performs equally to the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua and Xiaomi Redmi Note flagship, which is very respectable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oddly, the compound BaseMark OS II test puts the m2 note right next to the m1 note, while the new BaseMark OS II 2.0 gives the m1 note a significant edge over the m2 note.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the single-core and multi-core performance of the Cortex-A53 processor hit the bottom of our charts because of their lower clock.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it's time for the GPU checkup. As we mentioned above, the Meizu m2 note relies on a Mali-T720MP3 GPU, which is less capable than the Mali-T760MP2 configuration inside the m1 note. The MP2 and MP3 configuration aren't the best options for handling 1080p graphics, but they are OK for a mid-ranger which isn't targeting high-profile gaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the offscreen and onscreen tests are pretty much identical, but the latter clearly shows the performance supremacy of the 720p devices such as the Xperia M4 Aqua and Huawei P8lite.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BaseMark X GPU test also places the Meizu m2 note GPU behind the others.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, the web browsing performance turned out unimpressive in both browser tests - the JavaScript benchmark Kraken and the compound BrowserMark 2.1. Maybe you should look for an alternative to the default browser, such as Chrome.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Meizu has outfitted the m2 note with upgrades such as the wide-band LTE and microSD slot, but the main hardware has actually seen a downgrade. We could understand the lower CPU clock but not the GPU downgrade. At least the m2 note seems to be selling cheaper, which is somewhat of a compensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The m2 note is probably as good as the m1 note when it comes to day-to-day tasks, but it will do even worse at gaming than its predecessor. If gaming isn't your thing, then you should have no worries about the m2 note's performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At its core, the phonebook on the Meizu m2 note is a list of all contacts but you can view only a specific group or filter where contracts come from - phone contacts, email account or a Meizu account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't add Facebook or Twitter or any social network out of the box. Installing the Facebook or Twitter app will allow you to sync your contacts from there. You can link contacts, but the functionality is annoyingly limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook will automatically link contacts with the same name, but that's it. You can't manually link or unlink contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note has all reception bars full and held onto signal great even in tighter spots. Call quality is very good. A dedicated mic for active noise cancellation makes sure the other party hears you loud an clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features smart dialing, which is nice. Otherwise it doesn't differ from any other in functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone supports dual-SIM with dual-standby. The second SIM supports GSM networks only, while the primary works on 3G and LTE. Managing the SIM cards is very easy as is initiating calls and sending texts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note passed our loudspeaker test with barely an Average mark, but the speaker quality is very poor and while playing music, the m2 note subjectively sounds really quiet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and keyboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just New message, Search and Settings buttons. Above is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meizu has tweaked the generic email client. It supports multiple Exchange, POP or IMAP inboxes and you have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard of the Meizu m2 note is nicely laid out and has a four-row interface. There's a dedicated numeric view with a numpad-like style but we would have preferred the numbers as a line on top of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch between keyboard styles, send Meizu and text smileys and have an option to choose between many languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchPal keyboard is also pre-installed - it offers rich customization options including key width and height, themes, gestures, among other options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A lovable gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Flyme gallery has two viewing modes - photo and gallery. The photo stacks images into months while the gallery puts them into folders. You can add or remove folders from the gallery and also search through it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing an image feels a lot like the iOS gallery. By default the bars around an image are white with the content controls but upon a tap they turn black and lose all controls so you can focus on the image at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a built-in editor that offers filters and all the basic controls for contrast, brightness and you can even add blur or vignette. You cannot use different editors from the stock gallery and would need to install a third-party gallery (like Google's Photos) to have different editors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player supports Dirac HD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player can only find tracks located in the Music folder. You can browse your collection the traditional way or you can select to have it filtered by folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the first case tracks are sorted into several playlists like All songs, Recently added, Folders and you have the option to create custom playlists. When viewing All songs you can choose between three types of sorting in a tabbed layout: song name, artist and album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music controls are at the bottom of the screen. Choosing an artist will show you all the albums and corresponding songs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can access the equalizer from the advanced menu. It features several presets, which you can edit manually - but you need to insert the headphones first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music app supports Dirac HD Audio, which improves the sound output based on the specific headphone set you are using. There is also a standard music equalizer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very capable video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note comes with a dedicated Video app, but it expects videos to be placed in the video folder. You can use the file browser or gallery to get videos to play from elsewhere - it offers thumbnails and everything so we ended up using it more often than the Video app itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a pop-out option that allows you to view the video as an overlay to the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note played everything we threw at it - Xvid, DivX, MP4, MOV, WMV and it supports the AC3 audio codec, too. Subtitles are supported, but our unit had some issue with the encoding - regardless of the subtitles language, we always got Chinese characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall movies played without issues up to 1080p resolution on the m2 note.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note started off very well in our audio quality test. When connected to an active external amplifier, the smartphone showed average volume levels and excellently clean output for one of the better showings out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones, however, and deterioration is quite severe. Distortion of both types appeared, while frequency response is no longer perfectly accurate. Volume levels drop quite a bit too and we are witnessing an above average spike in stereo crosstalk. A rather unimpressive showing here by the m2 note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Capable 13MP snapper with a dual-tone LED flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note has a Samsung 13MP sensor that's capable of capturing some huge 4192x3104px snaps in 4:3 aspect - the same we met within the m1 note. There's also a dual-tone LED flash that should allow for more pleasing colors in low light flash photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface by default launches into Auto mode where the camera determines the shooting parameters. You have the option to turn on HDR (but no automatic HDR), gridlines for the viewfinder and a level gauge so that your horizon isn't off tilt. There's also an option to enable a timer of either 3, 5 or 10 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Available shooting modes include Auto, Manual (where you can set the shutter speed, ISO, exposure compensation and even the focus - from macro to infinity), Beauty (which can make eyes bigger, face slimmer, skin smoother and lighter), Panorama, Light field (which is Meizu's refocus app allowing you to defocus any part of the scene), Scan (for QR and barcodes), and Slowmotion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note snaps very good 13MP shots. The samples have plenty of resolved detail, the dynamic range is very good and the noise levels are kept quite low though at the expense of some of the fine detail definition. The contrast is very good, too. We remember the m1 note resolving more detail than the m2 note, but to be honest once you downscale those 13MP shots to you won't notice a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is meant to get a more even exposure of a scene - bringing back detail in the highlights and the shadows. On the Meizu m2 note it does very good job of bringing back detail in both and sometimes even produces more accurate colors than the Auto mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panoramas aren't too impressive on the Meizu m2 note. There is plenty of resolution and good overall exposure but the resolved detail is far too low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can check out a 5MP image taken with the front-facing camera of the device. It doesn't shine with too much detail but it would do a great job for selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can compare the Meizu m2 note to any of the smartphones we've tested so far in our photo quality comparison tool.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording at 30 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note shoots videos up to 1080p resolution at 30fps. There's no 60fps smooth motion option but you do get a 720p@100fps slow motion shooting mode that is rendered for playback as a slow motion 25fps video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All videos from the m2 note camera are stored in MP4 containers, the video bitrate is about 17Mpbs and the framerate is stable. This time around the audio is stereo - it uses an AAC codec with 128 Kbps bitrate and 48 KHz sampling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Framerate stays firmly at 30fps and we got almost no dropped frames. The resolved detail is just fine and the dynamic range is quite good although the videos have a somewhat soft contrast feel. Here is sample we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also directly download the 1080p@30fps video sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The MX browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser plays a central role in the Meizu m2 note as evidenced by its shortcut's position - the middle shortcut in the dock at the bottom of the homescreen, which is usually where the app drawer shortcut goes (or the dialer shortcut).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface dedicates almost the entire screen to the web page, save for the status bar on top and a tiny bar on the bottom for Refresh, Tabs and Bookmarks. Choosing Tabs opens a quick pop up preview of your open tabs instead of bringing up an entirely new screen, which is great as it still leaves the website your on in plain view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports double tap and pinch zooming. It's really fast and fluid too. There are also goodies like text reflow or sharing an URL over email or SMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's even a Reading mode that looks exactly like the one on the Apple iPhone. Normally we're against copying but the feature is a no-brainer that we'd like to see added to every major browser out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note features a calendar that supports multiple online accounts. It offers monthly, weekly, daily and agenda views and is pretty straightforward to work with. Creating a new event lets you set which calendar to store it in, along with a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar has a very minimal, clean look but retains all the functionality you'd expect. You can also go for the Google Calendar - it's available for download as a separate app from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we have the Clock app that will handle multiple alarms with custom repeat times, ringtones, snooze time and labels. There are also a stopwatch and timer integrated within the Clock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A calculator app is also on board. Interestingly you can use it as an overlay to the homescreen. You can't manually resize it but you can choose between two size settings. It offers a currency converter too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app is clean and simple. You can add notes, images and even check lists into it. The Painter app will let you paint with a number of virtual tools, choosing different colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Center works with only Chinese content but you can still use it, if you can read Chinese, that is. Thankfully, the Google Play store came preinstalled on our device so we got our apps from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled file manager lets you browse through the memory of the Meizu m2 note or through Recents, or through different media types - music, videos, pictures, etc. It allows copy, cut and paste and also sharing of files on your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the highlight of Meizu's homebrewed apps is the Security app. It lets you scan for viruses, clean junk files, keep an eye on your large files, manage your data traffic, and most importantly - control the permissions for each app you install.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the latest version of Google Maps comes pre-installed, so you can use it for navigation, offline maps, places suggestions, among the other cool features it offers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Build quality is solid, the matte plastic improves the grip</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is a letdown: lower maximum brightness and poorer sunlight legibility hardly leaves any upgrades except perhaps slightly deeper blacks for all that's worth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is very good both with and without the second SIM inside (69h Single/68h Dual)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rich connectivity options, but lack FM radio and NFC, we appreciate the added microSD support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flyme OS is visually rich and responsive, we especially enjoyed the unlocking gestures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The octa-core CPU does a good job, but the GPU performance is rather poor. Web benchmarks lag behind the competition</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player supports all video formats we tried, including limited subtitles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio quality fails to impress</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos come out good with enough detail and high dynamic range</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p video samples are OK, but not impressive</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note doesn't take it upon itself to make its predecessor obsolete. And perhaps Meizu wouldn't want to cut out the highly popular m1 note anyway. More like trying to capitalize on that and expand westwards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only 6 months behind the original, it's a slightly underpowered version, but with a microSD slot and wider LTE support. The latter backs up Meizu's ambition to expand beyond its home market. On the other hand, the phone was rumored as Meizu m1 note 2 ahead of its announcement and we guess that makes sense too now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But this is not to say the m2 note is an inferior package. In fact, even with its downgraded specs - for which Meizu is charging less than the m1 note's current price - it's still an excellent choice for the budget-conscious buyer. And although Meizu's own marketing is focused on the younger audience, advanced users too can find the package attractive enough. Keen gamers are perhaps the only group that would do well to look elsewhere - the m2 note's GPU simply isn't up to the task.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that though, we can't think of any major issues we'd call deal-breakers in a phone that costs less than $200. The Meizu m2 note has a more than decent build, quality screen and a capable camera. The expandable memory and Android Lollipop are certainly very welcome too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original Meizu m1 note costs between $10 and $50 more, depending on the online store you are opting for. If you are willing to give up Android Lollipop and the microSD slot and some LTE bands for a brighter screen, faster CPU and better GPU, there's your chance.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 is a more compact 5" version of the m2 note with a 720p display, along the lines of the original m1 note, which too had a smaller sibling. With everything else the same, the performance may actually get a boost given the lower screen resolution. The smaller screen and lower ppi should save you some ?50/$60.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Lenovo K3 Note matches the Meizu m2 note specs and price, it even offers improved CPU and GPU - the same as on the original m1 note. If you prefer Lenovo's Vibe take on the Android Lollipop instead of the Flyme launcher, you should check it out for sure.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The highly anticipated Xiaomi Redmi Note 2 became official just recently and is already available for purchase. It's another 5.5" smartphone with a 1080p display, much faster 2GHz octa-core processor and more powerful PowerVR G6200 GPU. Its 13MP camera has been upgraded with phase-detection auto focus, there is rich LTE band support and the latest MIUI v.7. The Redmi Note 2 costs as much as the Meizu m2 note and Flyme OS isn't your personal favorite, then you should seriously consider this beast.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The recently released Sony Xperia C4 is the perfect match for the Meizu m2 note. It has a 5.5" 1080p display, similar but faster MT6752 chip (the same as in the m1 note), a 13MP main camera and a 5MP selfie cam with a LED flash, dual-SIM and LTE, plus Android Lollipop. Unfortunately, this fella costs nearly twice as much. You could trade the bigger and better screen for water resistance on the Xperia M4 Aqua, and that one will be cheaper as well - but still unable to match the Meizu m2 note's price.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Finally, the Huawei P8lite with its 5" 720p display, octa-core Kirin 620 chip and 13MP cam might be worth a look. It's quite a handsome phone with premium design and finish, solid performance and a capable main camera.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note is in no mood for experimenting and follows the recipe of its predecessor to a T. This looks like the right approach if you know your biggest advantage is value for money - not creativity, top-notch hardware or brand recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest, the Meizu m2 note feels more like a version of the m1 note from a alternative universe than a next-gen upgrade. It's almost the same device, lacking here, improving there. Die-hard microSD fans and LTE speedsters will find it better, others should probably stick to the m1 note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The established brand still struggle to match the Chinese on price, while the Chinese in turn are competing against each other but also against years of habit, brand loyalty and telecom-subsidized competition. Speaking of, you bet Meizu are keen to match some of Xiaomi's feats at home but the Meizu m2 note is also in a fight that isn't local anymore.</paragraph>
