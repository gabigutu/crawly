			<paragraph>Finally, the Sony Ericsson W580 arrived at our test site - a music phone featuring a slim sliding construction, light effects and a pedometer to fulfill all your daily music and sports needs. The handset comes complete with a 2 megapixel camera, stereo Bluetooth, FM radio and a flashy design. Hop on the review express and take a trip with the latest music-minded Sony Ericson W580 - it might just turn out your next mobile handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Swedish-Japanese maker has added another slider to its Walkman lineup. The Sony Ericsson W580 joins the more feature-rich but older Sony Ericsson W850 in the company's music slider portfolio. The flagship in this form factor will be the fashionable W910, with sales likely to begin in September 07.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson W580 is the S500 W-twino the yet-to-come high-born relative: Walkman W910</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design for the young<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As most members of the Walkman family, W580 has sprung from a non-music phone: the Sony Ericsson S500. As regards design, the new W580 follows the latest style trends. Shedding weight is obviously on most makers' minds. The Sony Ericsson W580 stands at the pleasantly comfortable 99 ? 47 ? 14 mm, while its weight of 94 g is also sure to stir up a cheer. The bodywork is dominated by round shapes and curved edges. The fresh contemporary looks will likely appeal to a younger set of users. The handset will be available in three colors: white, black and gray. In all color variants however, the sides will be lined in black.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>    Pleasant to hold in hand ? compared to a credit card: can't frown at size<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In closed position, the handset has an almost perfectly rectangular shape. A backward curve at the bottom, right under the D-pad, is a nice touch. Sliding the phone open reveals the alphanumeric keys. The slide moves in plastic grooves, and the handset opens with a rustling sound. Sliding is easy, as the jutting out nest of the navigation key provides a comfortable pushing point. The spring loaded case needs but a touch of the thumb. When the handset is slid open, the top does appear slightly ajar but that's a minor issue unlikely to affect daily use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       The gray color combo is enhanced by blue highlights</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the body hold a few essentials. On the left side of the sliding front is the volume rocker. The top of the sliding half is the rather unusual location of the memory card slot (Memory Stick Micro or M2). The slot has a plastic cap, which is affixed to the handset's body. The retail package contains a 512 MB card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Fast port connector is on the right side this time. The On/Off button is at the top of the lower part of the handset. It's well sunk into the body, and not exposed to accidental presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All along the dividing line of the two parts of the slider there are light effect LEDs. They emit blinking light in five different colors to signal an incoming call. It's somewhat disappointing that the speed and pace of blinking aren't user-configurable, only the color is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear side of the handset is very neat and practical. There you'll only find the manufacturer logo and the Walkman series symbol. Half of the rear panel is taken by the battery cover. Removing it is quite an ordeal, the cover just won't move. Under it is a 930 mAh Li-Pol battery. It's officially quoted at 370 hours of stand-by time and 540 minutes of talk time. The SIM card holder is right above the battery bed. You'll be forced to use a pointed tool or rather long nails for inserting and removing the SIM card.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Circle-shaped keypad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W580 keypad will give you no reason to grudge. Its both parts are good enough. The D-pad is all round buttons. The biggest circle is the navigation key with its confirming center. Underneath it, one is surprised to find the loudspeaker. Sound is coming off the space between the navigation key and its round nest. The two rings at the sides are home to the selection keys and the Back and Clear keys. The tiniest round keys on the D-pad are the Walkman® key and the Activity Menu key. All keys on the D-pad work fine and are a pleasure to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keyboard is standard 12 keys in 4 rows. Given the slimness of the handset the keypad is almost dead flat, but that doesn't get in the way of typing. Tactility is adequate, the gentle clicking of the keys makes things even better. No reason to fear typos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keypad backlighting is ample and even. The navigation keys are backlit in orange, the alphanumeric buttons are white. Keypad locks automatically upon sliding the phone closed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display: small, but capable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W580 has a 2" 262K color TFT display with a QVGA resolution (240 x 320 pixels). Its quality is more than adequate, with pleasing color saturation and brightness, which is further configurable through the menu. The fairly small size of the display makes separate pixels impossible to see, resulting in a very soft and delicate screen image. Legibility under direct sunlight is almost excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone lacks any notification of missed events when it enters stand-by mode unless you have turned on the clock scrensaver. Otherwise, the phone enters standby mode, the screen shuts down completely and you need to activate the handset to check potential missed events.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Proven interface and navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface here differs in no way from the rest of the Sony Ericsson's Walkman handsets. The menu is teeming with animations, which you can't turn off. The status icons and shortcuts on the display are the good old stuff. The different size options for the digital clock are the only interesting thing. Users will likely welcome the possibility to use animated wallpapers or third-party UI themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a grid of 12 color icons, the way you view it can be altered with the preinstalled themes. Some of them offer monochrome 2D icons aligned to a grid. When vibration is activated, every movement through the main menu is marked by a short vibration. Deeper menu levels are text-only and uniform for all themes. A pleasing detail is the displaying of current time all across the menu levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Menu is accessed through the Confirming center of the navigation key, or the right soft key. The left selection key opens Recent calls. The directions of the navigation key can be assigned shortcuts to selected applications. The Up-key only is permanently fixed to start the camera since there is no other dedicated camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shortcuts to frequently used functions can be placed in the Activity Menu, which allows multitasking applications. The rest of the Activity Menu tabs are New Events, Running Apps and Internet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every time you turn on the Sony Ericsson W580, it will prompt switching to flight mode with all wireless transmissions disabled. The inconvenience here is that the offline mode too requires an inserted SIM. You can of course turn this system prompt off if needed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A sliding camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The lens of the 2 megapixel camera is at the back of the sliding part of the handset. With the phone closed it's protected from scratches and dirt. The surface at the back of the sliding section is orange, patterned with numerous circles of a slightly lighter shade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera shoots in a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. Regretfully, it has no autofocus, nor flash. Pictures are taken with the handset held in portrait mode, part of the display serving as the viewfinder. The center of the navigation key is the capture button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors come out well, but pictures suffer from a considerable loss of detail. Overall, the picture quality is a bit above average. Shooting close objects is problematic due to the lack of an autofocus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the camera menu you can select picture size, white balance, exposure compensation, picture quality, self-release timer, night mode, shutter sound, color effects, picture frames, and burst mode. There's a panorama shooting mode for combining three shots into one wide picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2.5x digital zoom is available only with picture size set to VGA resolution. Pictures are saved in the phone memory or on the memory card; they're easy to send via Bluetooth, email or MMS. Sending a picture to a blog and direct printing on a PictBridge compatible printer are other available options. The phone memory is about 12 MB. The supplied 512MB memory card can also be used as a storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sample video recorded with Sony Ericsson W580</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W580 also captures video in 3GP format; recording length is unlimited and depends on the available memory only. Unfortunately, the handset offers only the dismal resolution of 176 x 144 pixels. When shooting video, digital zoom and exposure compensation are enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture gallery for viewing your shots is under File manager. Depending on the user preference, 4 or 9 pictures are displayed in thumbnail view, or a list of photos with details about the time they were taken. A handy option is the Timeline view allowing you to browse your pictures chronologically. User can opt for fullscreen view or use the slideshow function.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony without changes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No novelties are to be expected in telephony. The phonebook capacity is 1000 contacts and up to 2500 phone numbers. Contacts can be assigned different details: up to five phone numbers, three emails, a web address, postal address, a note, birthday, ringtone, thumbnail or a video recording, which is played during an incoming call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are listed by first or last name. Using phone memory or SIM is user-configurable. Displaying contacts from both memory locations simultaneously continues to be impossible. Contacts are gradual-typing searchable. The built-in handsfree, call recorder and voice dialing are sure to be appreciated. Sony Ericsson W580 is quad-band enabled (850/900/1800/1900 MHz). Calls can be accepted and ended by sliding the phone open and closed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ringing profiles let you set ringing volume and filter incoming calls. Choosing the incoming call and SMS alerts is traditionally outside the ringing profiles. Apart from the preinstalled 40-tone polyphonic ringtones, any MP3, WMA, AAC or AMR file can be set as an incoming call alert. The same applies to message alerts. Ringing profiles are quick to access and switched between using the On/Off button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: all-out classic<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All-round messaging functionality is on hand: text and multimedia messages, an email client, RSS feed reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text messages you compose or read display in 8 lines thanks to the ample display. Regretfully, the SMS editor gives no options regarding font size. The T9 dictionary is there too. Character counter displays only when you're 10 characters from the maximum character count. EMS support is also there, small images can be embedded in the text. All the user-available memory is at hand for storing received messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MMS editor, as seen here, first appeared in the Sony Ericsson K800. Underneath the compose window there's a taskbar, which is used for inserting images, photos, videos or sounds. It also allows you to directly launch the camera or voice recorder. Inserted objects are viewed on the display, the MMS preview mode provides a very convenient control. Maximum MMS size is 300 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client allows setting up several accounts, but sadly can't handle them simultaneously. Choice of email alerts, automatic mail check and downloading message headers only are all available for the user to set. No worries sending full-res photos as attachments or opting for the maximum attachment size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RSS reader is also part of the Messages menu. There are several bookmarked channels, but the list is fully user-configurable. Getting them organized in groups is however impossible. Updates can be manual or automatic at a set time. Viewing feeds is quick and friendly, clicking on a message launches the internet browser.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time management up to standard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizing functions here are the usual decent stuff. The calendar offers a monthly, weekly and daily view. There's only one type of entry: appointment. Each appointment can be assigned a subject, start time, end time, location, description, reminder at a preset time, as well as a daily, weekly or monthly repeat option. The week can be set to start on any day. The downer here is that custom sound alerts are impossible to set. The preinstalled reminder sounds are very short and dull.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Tasks and a Notes function are also present in the organizer. Tasks can be set reminders but can't be assigned priority. You can also make and save notes. Both notes and tasks can be sent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock is quite elaborate. It is easy to set up to 5 alarms with independent repeat patterns. Additionally, each alarm can be assigned a description to be displayed at a selected time. When setting alarm signals you can opt between sound and radio. Under organizer you'll also find a stopwatch, timer and calculator.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music and Fun<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The entertainment package is dominated by the Walkman® music player compatible with MP3, AAC, AAC+, eAAC+ and WMA file formats. Tracks are filtered by artist or album. You can choose to list all tracks or create your own playlists. Loop and Shuffle modes are available, as well as a stereo enhancement and equalizer setting. The equalizer offers a Mega Bass function and manual settings. The music player has three color themes (skins): black, gray and orange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music can be enjoyed on the not so good loudspeaker, or - more advisable - on the headphones you get in the standard package. We've come across those standard inclusion headphones repeatedly. They perform admirably and offer replaceable rubber earbuds for enhanced listening experience. You can also use your own headset with the standard 3.5 mm audio jack. The A2DP-enabled Bluetooth makes wireless stereo headphones arguably the best option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entertainment is enhanced by an FM radio with RDS functionality. It will search automatically and store up to 20 radio stations in you area. The FM radio is only operable with the hands-free connected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player works with 3GP and MP4 formats. The function is also available. A closer look at the TrackID application is available in our recent Sony Ericsson W660 review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two preinstalled Java games: the Tetris-like Lumines Block Challenge and the Sims 2 strategy. Other available Java applications are MusicMate offering a metronome function and guitar and piano accords player and the Walk Around the World application, which measures the walking distance to some of the world's biggest cities . The Pocket Trainer application provides details of each training session. Now standard for many Sony Ericsson handsets, the MusicDJ, PhotoDJ and VideoDJ applications are also available. They let you compose and edit melodies to use as ringtones and edit pictures and video clips. Under Entertainment you'll also find the sound recorder.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman Does Walk<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A key benefit of the Sony Ericsson W580 is the integrated fitness application. A motion sensor is used to calculate the number of steps and total distance covered walking or running. The user is required to enter personal data about height, weight, year of birth and gender to enjoy the full functionality of the fitness application. Further calibration of the phone is needed by setting units for distance, speed/pace and calories. Advanced calibration allows you to define measures of distance by walking a known distance. The step count is on by default unless you turn it off. A step count icon indicates it's active and the number of steps is visible on the stand-by display. The step count for a particular day is stored in the memory. The information provided by the application is approximate and should not be trusted unreservedly. Since we tested the step counter in the Sony Ericsson W710 review, we can pretty much rely on the application as a reference point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to walking, there's a running function, which measures the distance, time and speed of a session. Among Java applications you'll find the Pocket Trainer, showing various details about training sessions. The Pocket Trainer also has a sporting quiz likely to be enjoyed by sport fans.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data: EDGE is enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Don't get your hopes too high when it goes to data transfers. Next to the traditional - not to say outdated - GPRS, the W580 also features EDGE, both class 10. There's no UMTS support. Fast port and Bluetooth can be used for short distance data transfers. Once the phone's been connected to PC, you'll be prompted to choose between Phone mode and File Transfer. Thanks to the USB Mass Storage support no driver installation is necessary. In File Transfer mode however the phone is unusable and can't receive calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web access is ensured through WAP and the NetFront browser. The latter is elaborate enough and offers a wide range of options, including landscape view of web pages. The impossibility to minimize it is the only shortfall of the browser we identified.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization of contacts and calendar with MS Outlook goes without saying. The needed software is available on the included CD. There is also a photo editing application, and the Disc2Phone computer software for transferring music from CDs or PC to your phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson are trying to diversify their Walkman series in all price segments and form factors. The Sony Ericsson W580 joins the ranks as a mid-tier slider. With its design and compact size it's likely to inspire a predominantly young following. Users will appreciate the adequate 2 megapixel camera, quality display, elaborate music features and the fitness application. The lack of notification of missed events and the low-resolution video are the major disappointments. Light effects are not much of a boost either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  Music rival Nokia 5300: less loaded with functions, but a great deal cheaper</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W580 will be in sale any moment now. The main competitor Nokia 5300 is also a music slider. Its 1.3 megapixel camera and 256MB memory card are not much of a brag, but the difference in price can be decisive.</paragraph>
