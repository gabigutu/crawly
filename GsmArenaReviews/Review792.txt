			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony's Xperia T lineup has been growing out of 007's tux and the third generation is putting on a t-shirt. OK, an oversized t-shirt, although the T3 has lost some weight, and screen real-estate, compared to the T2. Gone is the Ultra moniker and the massive 6" display - the Xperia T3 is closer to smartphones than phablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is indeed that simple, the Sony Xperia T3 is a more compact version of the Xperia T2 Ultra phablet, one that you can slip in your pocket. The screen is still a high-quality IPS unit of 720p resolution and Sony once again goes for the Snapdragon 400.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T3 is running KitKat out of the box which is good, but other specs are taken a notch down. The camera, to begin with, is now an 8MP unit, down from 13MP in the T2 Ultra. On the upside, the proper shutter key is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a 2,500mAh battery, the Xperia T3 will probably struggle to match the impressive times of the T2 Ultra, but we'd be happy if it gets close enough. Here is the complete list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 seems reasonably equipped for the midrange and does well to offer LTE connectivity on top of good looks and solid build. It's also one of the thinnest Sony smartphones around with only the Z Ultra having a thinner profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sealed battery should hardly be a surprise, we guess it's part of the price you are paying for the Omni Balance design. That said, we have perhaps seen too much of it already, though it isn't something to hold against a device of the Xperia T3's price bracket and level of equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Xperia T3 sure looks like a familiar package but, if we're lucky, not a pedestrian effort. As usual, we are kicking off with our traditional exterior checkup.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Sony Xperia T3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Sony Xperia T3 covers just the basics. There's an A/C adapter, a microUSB cable and the headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia T3 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 measures 150.7 x 77 x 7mm - that's 15mm shorter, 7mm narrower and a tad slimmer than the Xperia T2 Ultra phablet and very close to the Xperia Z2 flagship. The Sony Xperia T3 weighs 148g, reasonable for a solid midranger of such caliber and 15g lighter than the all-glass Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not like we haven't seen the OmniBalance design used on a plethora of Xperia smartphones over the past few years. It's probably time the next flagship moved on but the midrange Xperia T3 is on the safe side. It looks reasonably good and has pleasant handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3's entire front is occupied by the 5.3" IPS display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The non-removable rear cover is made of plastic, with matte finish in graphite black. The material doesn't look or feel low quality, but fingerprints tend to stick on. They would probably be harder to notice on the white and purple versions. Still, the issue is not as obvious as it would have been on a glossy surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like most of the previous Xperia phones, the Xperia T3 sides are lined with a glossy strip for a nice contrasting accent. The only thing actually made of metal is the signature power/lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Sony Xperia T3 is a pleasure and the screen size isn't a particular burden. With a 7mm waistline, the Xperia T3 feels great in hand, not bulky at all, and well put together, no wobbles or squeaks. In fact, it's among the thinnest Sony phones ever.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 flaunts a 5.3" IPS Triluminos display of 720p resolution, which works out to 277ppi. While this is nowhere near the 400+ pixel density of current flagships, it's a completely different price range we're talking about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T3 display is enhanced by Sony's Mobile BRAVIA 2 and X-Reality engine. The combo aims to improve sharpness, reduce noise, while boosting contrast and saturation, and it does a pretty good job of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is standard RGB with an equal amount of green, red and blue pixels in line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 uses a standard RGB matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen's contrast and brightness are very good, and so is color reproduction, all adding up to excellent image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles, thanks to the IPS matrix, are better than average. There is no contrast and color washing when you look the screen at an angle, though there is a noticeable color shift from some directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, even with Auto Brightness off, the ambient light sensor kept on intervening and we couldn't run our test at 50%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Sony Xperia T3 in bright outdoor conditions turned out quite a trouble-free experience. The smartphone even managed to slightly outdo the HTC One (M8) in our test.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 has pretty much the same controls as preceding Xperia models. The control layout is pretty much set in stone, and in the T series that includes a dedicated shutter key. Good thing they kept it even though the camera resolution took the axe - from 13MP in the Xperia T2 Ultra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the 5.3" display we find the etched earpiece with a status LED underneath the elegant grille. There're a couple of sensors around the Sony logo at the top, next to an HD front camera. There is quite a bit of blank space below the display, since the main controls are on the screen itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Xperia T3 is quite busy - it features the microSD card slot covered by a plastic flap, the power/lock button, volume rocker and the half-press-enabled shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a pull-out tag with the regulator-mandated certifications just below the microSIM bed. This is a very clever way to have those mandatory labels without engraving them into the casing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unprotected microUSB port is lonely on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T3 places the 3.5mm audio jack at the top, while the mouthpiece is over the bottom. There is a lanyard eyelet around, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 matte back has the 8MP ExmorRS camera lens along with a single LED flash. The prominent speaker grille is near the bottom.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery Life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has put a 2500mAh battery inside the Xperia T3, down from 3000mAh in the previous Ultra version. We ran our battery test with the battery-saving STAMINA mode off. It scored 75 hours, which means you can count on 3 full days if you do an hour each of calling, web browsing and playing video per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a more detailed breakdown of the Sony Xperia T3 battery performance check out our blogpost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 has three distinct versions for different markets. Here's the list of supported bands by model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity features available across all models include dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and Wi-Fi Direct. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and GLONASS, plus an FM radio with RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is NFC connectivity, too, with support for Android Beam for sending files to other Android devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for the ultra-low power ANT+ connectivity protocol, which is typically used for connecting to various sports accessories such as heart rate monitors or bicycle speed &amp; cadence meters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microUSB 2.0 port for charging and data connections. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory and microSD card over a USB connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also USB On-the-go for connecting USB peripherals such as pen drives, keyboards or real USB hard drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port doesn't have any TV-out functionality, but if you have a compatible HDTV, you can mirror your phone's screen wirelessly via the Miracast protocol.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 runs on Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. The software package looks very much the same whatever the Android version though and that's why everything feels and seems so familiar compared to any of the latest Xperia phones. Sony has managed to sneak a few improvements along the way, but nothing major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes our usual demo video to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the usual affair - it supports widgets (one per pane), plus there is a shortcut to the camera at the bottom courtesy of Android KitKat. There are a few available default widgets, but you can always get more from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T3 lets you add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and set any of them as default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff on the homescreen is easy, as it is the customization. You can set various live and static wallpapers, add widgets and shortcut, or change the UI theme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area loses the quick toggles, but don't you worry, they've been just moved on a separate tab. You can gain quick access to the Quick Settings tab with a two-finger swipe from the top. The toggles are customizable and you can choose between 17 different toggles and have up to 12 of them visible in their dedicated page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T3 uses the stock Android task manager that lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe. There is a Close All button this time around though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called "small apps" are also available in the Xperia T3 and are accessible via the task manager. They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app. So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Touch Lock. You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or use the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's new app is on board, though you can access it via shortcut only unlike the Xperia Z2 where it was available from within the Google Now quick access. This app has very beautiful UI and will show you the hottest apps and multimedia today, but it isn't limited to the Play Store only. It'll display content from Sony's PlayStation store too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can access Google Now by swiping from the bottom of the UI. Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet the user interface is buttery smooth, there is no lag and everything happens lightning-fast. The Sony launcher is lightweight and, combined with the snappy chipset and the fastest available Android OS, you'll get an amazing UI experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T3 is running on the Snapdragon 400 mid-range chipset. It offers four Cortex-A7 CPU cores ticking at 1.4 GHz, Adreno 305 graphics and 1GB of RAM. We've already seen the Snapdragon 400 in action on the Motorola Moto G, the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra and M2, the HTC Desire 816, the HTC One mini 2 and several others so it's clearly a quite popular choice. And rightfully so as it delivers a snappy performance in everyday use and quite acceptable gaming chops as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with the CPU benchmarks, the Xperia T3 posted a great result on the multi-core GeekBench 3 cross-platform benchmark. It managed to beat every other S400 device we've tested so far but the HTC One mini 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. The Xperia T3 numbers are quite good too, slightly below the quad-core Cortex-A7-powered HTC Desire 816 but nerveless better than all other Snapdragon 400 phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single, multi-core performance, math performance and more. We focus on the overall score and the dedicated CPU scores. The Sony Xperia T3 overall rating is excellent for its target group yet again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-core test score is great too, though the octa-core-powered HTC Desire 616 is the real champ here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics benchmark results came out average. The GFXBench tests - both off-screen and on-screen variants - reflected some OK performance on par with the competition. It did worse on the on-screen tests than the Xperia M2, which has the same chipset but packs a lower resolution qHD less-demanding display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 305 is a capable GPU, but the quad-core Mali-450MP4 within the Huawei Ascend P7, Alcatel Idol X+, Gionee Elife S5.5 and the HTC Desire 616 is obviously better and doubles the performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The on-screen test is where the score matters the most as is the display resolution. The Xperia M2 has a lower than HD display at 540x960 pixels and that's why it comes on top, while the 1080p-packing Alcatel Idol X+ and Gionee Elife S5.5 - at the bottom. The Xperia T3 score is good enough meaning you will be able to handle the lots of heavy 3D games.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OpenGL ES3.0 is required for the Manhattan 3.0 test and only devices running on Android 4.3 Jelly Bean or higher can handle it. It affirmed our conclusions from the T-Rex 2.7 tests with pretty much the same output.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BrowserMark 2.1 tests HTML 5 performance, while Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 is JavaScript-centric. The Sony Xperia T3 managed very good scores in both tests.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T3 and its snappy Snapdragon 400 chipset occasionally stand out from the crowd. It delivers some great scores on the synthetic tests, which means you will be getting excellent performance in real life. And that's what really matters - a smooth Android experience coupled with hiccup-free gaming pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 phonebook is integrated with the dialer using a tabbed interface - the Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs can be side-swiped. The contact list has a dedicated search filed plus it offers and an alphabetical scroll bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking contacts is available, quick contact feature is here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia T3 was nothing short of pleasing. There is noise-cancelling options that is on by default, but you can turn it off from Settings. There is also a Slow Talk option, which will actively slow the speech of the other calling party. You can even apply equalizer settings, but you can choose only between Normal, Bright and Smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer support smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T3 scored a Good mark in our loudspeaker tests, meaning you are unlikely to miss some calls and notifications if you are in a noisy environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has preloaded a number of features that modify how the speaker sounds. We tested with all of them off, then with xLOUD on, but that made very little to no difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message automatically into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the Gmail client and the default Email apps are onboard. Gmail can sync only with (multiple) Google accounts, while the generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia T3 offers a customizable on-screen full QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled. Different keyboard skins are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-hand size keyboard is available too, but only in portrait orientation. If enabled, it squeezes the onscreen keyboard to the left or right side of the screen so it gets more comfortable for single handed text input.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Album is your gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can change the thumbnails size by pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike previous versions there isn't a homepage that hosts all of your albums, instead you get the same swipe-able menu the app drawer is offering. There you can find all of your online and offline albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery can connect to online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) and also to other devices on the local network. Maps and Globe albums are also available, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slide show using the SensMe brand and much like the music player feature, this one scans files and groups similar photos together.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A familiar video player crippled by the lack of AC3 codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this doesn't work very well for downloaded TV shows - it doesn't recognize the S01E02 naming convention and won't pull info about individual episodes. It gets worse, Gracenote seems to be lacking info on TV shows in general, we couldn't find even popular shows like The Big Bang Theory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is more bad news - the video player does plays 1080p files hassle-free but the supported codecs are limited to Xvid, MP4 and MKV files. DTS and AC3 audio tracks are not supported, which makes the MKV compatibility pretty much obsolete. We know you can always get a proper video player app from the Play Store but it's a shame you can't just use the eye-candy default player for everything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the video player supports subtitles, and you can customize their looks. Unfortunately, you cannot manually pick the subtitle file, it has to reside in the video folder to load up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman plays the music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia smartphones. It features Music Unlimited integration and is not above trying to sell you songs, but you can hide the Music Unlimited stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman interface is based on a hidden swipe-able menu that sort your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to connect the player with your Facebook account). You can pop up the menu the same way you'd do it in the app drawer or the gallery - just swipe from the left edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Unlimited stuff includes ways to discover new music - Charts, New releases and Channels. Those can be hidden individually (same goes for the artist/album/playlist tiles) or you can disable the service altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infinite button is available in the Now Playing screen (just tap the album art) - it will help you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman player offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ option is here, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details. Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in volume between tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements contain yet more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Then there's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD boosts up the internal speaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 features an FM Radio with RDS. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 did fairly well in our audio quality test, demonstrating clean output in the two test scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we did the first test with the smartphone connected to an active external amplifier and it produced some very good scores. The Xperia T3 showed no weak points to its performance, except for the volume which was disappointingly low.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones causes a somewhat big spike in the stereo crosstalk and adds some harmonic distortion, but the latter is hard to detect outside lab conditions. The volume levels are once again the only problem with the output, although quiet but clean output are generally considered satisfactory in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The 8MP camera does above average<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3's camera uses one of Sony's standard-issue 8MP Exmor RS sensor. It shoots with a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 both Superior Auto and Manual mode. There is a LED flash to help you with the low-light scenes, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T3 comes with a hardware shutter key. It's quite tiny and many people would probably find it uncomfortable. The good thing about it is that you can set it up to unlock the phone and start the camera. It can also snap a photo or start capturing video immediately. This might come in handy for those occasions when you want to capture something quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes and is unified with the camcorder one - you can snap a photo or shoot a video without changing modes most of the times. Depending on the shooting mode you're in, the video shutter key may be replaced by a still/video mode toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the full resolution Manual mode you also get access to "manual controls" on the viewfinder, which sounds more impressive than it really is. There's an exposure compensation slider and a white balance selector. You can also control the ISO, metering and focus modes, turn on/off image stabilization, but those are buried in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Superior Auto shooting mode is what we've already seen in other Xperia phones - this time around it can shoot in full resolution in addition to the lower-res 16:9 mode. There are no settings you can change besides the aspect ratio, everything is done automatically. Unlike the 20MP Sony Xperia phones, the images taken with Superior Auto have the same quality as the one shot in Normal (Manual) mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual and Superior Auto aside, the Xperia T3 offers several other interesting shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Sweep panorama but, unfortunately, panoramas come out with 5MP resolution, lousy stitching and uninspiring quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs visual cues to track your motion). Children will love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes include the regular Picture effect mode, which creates a 3 x 3 grid that shows all the available effects in real time. Sony has also included a mode called Social streaming, which can live-stream the video feed from your camera directly on your Facebook profile. That's certainly not something you see every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Timeshift replaces the regular burst mode, it captures 30 shots in just 2 seconds. The intriguing thing is it starts shooting even before you've pressed the shutter button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Background defocus - it take a photo and blurs the background. This mode shoots a few shots with different focus and then blurs everything in the background but the object in focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sounds like a nice thing on paper, but it fails quite often and you need to try again and again, and keep as steady as possible while shooting.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both 8MP shots taken in Superior Auto and in Manual mode have plenty of detail - the resolved amount is very good though the images are a bit too noisy. Contrast is excellent, while the white balance is on spot. The produced colors are nice and punchy, accurate in Manual, but oversaturated in Superior Auto mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is lots of noise in some pictures but it isn't that much intrusive. We guess it's better to leave the noise, rather than smudge the fine detail with a harsh noise reduction algorithm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the 8MP shots we've snapped:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are a few samples taken in Superior Auto mode. They have the same quality as the Manual ones, but the colors are slightly oversaturated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Superior Auto would occasionally activate the HDR mode when it decides it's needed, if you really want to force it, you'd have to go to Manual mode and choose Backlight Correction (HDR) from the Scenes sub-menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is conservative and rescues both the highlights and shadows without making the contrast too low. Despite that we find the effect somewhat unnatural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of HDR samples:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We uploaded the full resolution 8MP photos to our photo quality comparison database to compare against other high-resolution smartphones. The resolved detail is good, but there is lots of noise and this time around it gets in the way. Still the Xperia T3 is far more capable than the Xperia M2, which we reviewed recently.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording done in 1080p at 30 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 is capable of capturing 1080p video at 30fps. The camcorder shares the same UI as the still camera. You can set a timer and fiddle with settings like exposure, metering, focus mode, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For videos the T3 features a proprietary SteadyShot digital image stabilization, but there's a price to pay - the field of view (FoV) is reduced (it's how all digital stabilization systems work). The phone is smart enough to detect whether you are shooting hand-held or you have rested it on something stable but you get the reduced FoV either way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go into video mode from the Manual shooting mode, you get an HDR option, as well as various preset scenes to pick from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also snap stills during video recording but that's not of much use as you only get 1080p images, you might as well grab a frame from the video later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 is a reasonably powerful camcorder. It captures 1080p videos at just under 30 frames per second with a good bitrate of 19Mbps with stereo sound recording with a bitrate of 96 Kbps and 48 kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end results are good, but not perfect. The resolved detail isn't as much as we hoped for, colors and contrast are on par with still images as are the high noise levels. The videos are smooth with a framerate of 29-30 fps with minor variations. The continuous autofocus is much too eager and triggers too often though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 1080p sample, which we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T3 is also capable of capturing 1080p@30fps HDR videos. The quality is the same as the standard video samples, though the HDR effect isn't working as we hoped for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out the HDR samples we've uploaded on YouTube as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 captures good 1080p videos. It also manages to resolve lots of detail in the background in good light conditions, but fails to do so in the foreground. There is lots of noise in the low-light scene, though the lack of a harsh noise reduction algorithm allows for keeping more detail. You can check out how it does against the competition in good and low lighting conditions and look at the ISO chart for a synthetic estimation of the resolved detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T3 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups. Reduce data usage does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too. Incognito tabs, which lets you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Chrome doesn't have an easier to navigate and see Reading mode as the one on iOS. There isn't any Save for Later reading list either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T3 also features the Office Suite 7, which allows for creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt), and it can also read PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calculator, Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer), Sketch and File Manager apps are available by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Socialife app comes pre-installed too. It is a service similar to Samsung's My Magazine and HTC One's Blinkfeed. The interface is clean and simple yet beautiful, and there are lots of preloaded feeds. You can add your own RSS links too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Select does the same as the Sony's What's New app, but comes with much less functions and old UI. We feel Sony should retire it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet Google Maps and Navigation are also part of the app package to utilize the built-in GPS receiver (with added GLONASS support). Offline maps are available, again, since the last update, so you can save some data traffic too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever you may be missing, there is the always-growing Google Play Store for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T3 isn't the regular mid-ranger we've expected it to be. It comes with an excellent build quality and an extra slim profile, it's as snappy as you may expect and it's got some great imaging capabilities. We really like the displays Sony is putting on its latest Xperia phones and the Xperia T3's 5.3" IPS unit is great, too. The smartphone would have been the perfect mid-ranger if it was water and dust proof, but we can't have it all, can we?</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Xperia T3 performed admirably in almost every task. The battery backup is enough to ensure you can enjoy for quite some time between charges. There is very little we miss in the Xperia T3 - the user-accessible battery and the uninspiring video recording being among the very few features that come in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T3 stands somewhere between the affordable Xperia M2 and the massive Xperia T2 Ultra phablet. It's in fact a more reasonably sized version of the T2 Ultra packing the same internals and quality display, but cutting off some screen estate and camera megapixels. It even comes with Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box plus the latest available Sony default apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia &#x422;3 key test findings:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today the smartphone market is overwhelmed with mid-range phones and it's probably the segment where the manufacturers need to make their offers really stand out. And this is exactly where Sony failed. It didn't do wrong with the Xperia T3, it just can't shine among the last year's flagship, not yet. The pricing isn't right at launch and unless Sony fixes it soon, the Xperia T3 might be forgotten in few months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest threat to our guest of honor comes from Sony's lineup itself - the powerful Xperia Z1. It is water and dust proof, offers better screen, faster performance and premium camera capabilities. The Xperia Z1 costs even less than the Xperia T3, so Sony has literally beaten itself in its own game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then you can look at all of the 2013 top smartphones - the Snapdragon 800-powered LG G2 with 13MP OIS camera, the Snapdragon 800-powered version of the Galaxy S4 with better camera and screen, even the six-core Galaxy Note 3 Neo with Super AMOLED HD screen and cool S-Pen capabilities. Each of those phones is unique in a particular way and offer more than the equally, or in the case of Note 3 Neo higher, priced Sony Xperia T3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG G2 ? Samsung I9506 Galaxy S4 ? Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire 816 is powered by the same Snapdragon 400 platform and offers slightly bigger display for the same cash. It bets on a 13MP rear and a 5MP front camera sensors, comes with more RAM, richer user interface and a bigger battery. Don't forget the powerful stereo speakers at the front, too. Yes, it is another unique mid-ranger you will remember with its key features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire 816</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony either got the situation wrong or it didn't care for the market at all. Sony Xperia T3 is a great device, feature-rich and reliable, which will save the day for any task, anytime. It just isn't the head-turner as most of its competitors are. But with the right pricing it can do great, so it's up to Sony now.</paragraph>
