		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You just couldn't have missed the Samsung Corby. Dirty cheap phone with replaceable rear covers and more clones than features. That's the one. Newsflash: the outbreak of cheap as chips touchscreen handsets continues now that we have the Lindy - fresh off Corby's rib.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the deal. Samsung want to put a touchscreen in every pocket but the Lindy is also trying to give fast data and WLAN to the masses. It's all Corby on the surface - to the extent that you will want to put some of Corby's fashion jackets on the Lindy. They won't fit but that's not the point. The point is the Lindy is a plain and friendly touchscreen that puts a bargain price on all-round functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Someone at Samsung must be in love with the Corby concept since the family is getting bigger by the day. The number of Corby sequels is beyond belief: the QWERTY packing CorbyPRO and CorbyTXT were followed by the Wi-Fi enabled, but still rumored S3650W and - finally - out came the M5650 Lindy. Not to mention the several handsets that don't exactly follow the same design outline but have the same naming in certain regions - Samsung B3313 Corby Mate, Samsung CorbyPlus B3410 and Samsung C3510 Corby Pop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Lindy however inherits all the traditions of the original - neat and friendly plasticky design, rich social integration, modern interface with the optional cartoonish graphics on top and the most important thing - a capacitive touchscreen with an affordable price. But like all the other new members of the family, the Lindy tries to break out of the clone syndrome by offering its own special powers. Wi-Fi connectivity, 3.5 mm audio jack and dedicated music keys put it well above the basic Corby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Corby need not feel threatened: the intended markets are poles apart. The new features raise the M5650 above the rank and file and straight into the mid-range, while the Corby is very much an entry-level kiddie phone. Wi-Fi is welcome, but this is not the only upgrade that the Lindy offers over the Corby. It loves music and has dedicated media controls right up front, DNSe and SRS surround enhancements and the 3.5 mm audio jack of course. We nearly forgot the fast network data speeds. And then all of a sudden, the Lindy costs the same as the S3650 Corby did at launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we have to admit that Samsung have flooded the market with similar handsets. There's the Star, Star Wi-Fi, Star TV, the Corby bunch, the Diva and the Marvel. The Lindy looks set to lead in both features and design, but it's not like we haven't seen all this before. Will it succeed to stand out among so many siblings? And more importantly, can it stand up to the competition? The journey begins with design and ergonomics.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Lindy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M5650 Lindy comes in a standard package. There is the mandatory charger, a microUSB data cable and a stylish white 3.5mm headset. A bunch of leaflets are also supplied. There's no memory card, you'd have to buy a microSD card by yourself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung M5650 Lindy 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic Samsung M5650 Lindy measures 106 x 57 x 12 mm and weighs 98 grams, which is the same as the S3650 Corby. The two phones are clones really, save for Lindy's music keys. It's mostly the 3.5mm audio jack on the Lindy that won't allow Corby's fashion jackets to fit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The plastic construction of the M5650 Lindy certainly helps it keep its weight down to a svelte 98 grams. The entire surface is glossy and this seems to attract fingerprints like the plague. We've played around with the phone for a while to find it is quite resistant to scratches in defiance of it sleek front. Ergonomically it's very good and the oval shaped back panel makes gripping it easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lindy 2.8" display has a standard QVGA resolution (240 x 320 pixels). Its image quality isn't as impressive as on high-end Samsung phones but that's more or less implied by the gentle price tag. Sunlight legibility is well below the iPhone or Nokia standards, the narrow viewing angle the biggest disadvantage. Indoors the screen is quite good though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the M5650 Lindy has a capacitive touchscreen, which is very responsive to even the gentlest of taps and sweeps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, there are just the earpiece and the video-call camera - there's no ambient light sensor to optimize the screen brightness. There are six hardware keys below - two receiver keys on each side of the Back button and the dedicated music controls. The Call and End keys are integrated into the body of the phone and have a distinct and audible click when pressed. The media buttons are nicely set apart with their blue color, the same hue as the battery cover. Right under the play/pause key is the tiny mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's one thing we don't quite get about the dedicated music keys though. They only work on the homescreen, which doesn't make much sense - there's a widget for that. So, if you have music running in the background and you're busy doing something else (writing text, editing a contact, browsing pictures, etc) you can't even skip or pause tracks. You'll need to go back all the way to the homescreen to do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M5650 Lindy's right-hand side houses just two controls - the shutter button and the HOLD key, which is used to lock and unlock the touchscreen. They are located very close to each other, which doesn't provide the best touch orientation. What's more, the shutter key falls right in the middle and this isn't the most comfortable location for taking pictures. On that same side, hidden under the battery cover, is the microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lanyard eyelet is on the top left side, followed by the volume rocker in the middle and the microUSB port beneath for connecting a charger or data cable. Traditionally, the USB slot is covered with a plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top features the 3.5mm audio jack only, which has no protective cap, while the bottom side is absolutely bare, save for a tiny slit that's used to help you remove the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the rear you will notice some random semicircular patterns grooved into the surface. There's the camera lens at the top end and the loudspeaker grill is at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 960 mAh Li-Ion battery. There is no official word so far on standby and talk times, but our pre-release unit lasted a good 3 to 4 days of moderate use. The only thing under the battery is the SIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung M5650 Lindy is a perfect copy of the S3650 Corby. It is a pleasingly compact touchscreen phone and while it's not the slimmest around, the ergonomic design more than makes up for that. It only feels fair to warn against possibly misjudging this one. The Lindy does look like a toy and unsuspecting customers may pass it by with barely a glance. And that won't be a wise thing to do: the Lindy is a bargain-priced WLAN and HSDPA enabled little phone.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Corby-styled TouchWiz<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The M5650 Lindy offers three different homescreen panes that you can alternate by sideways sweeps. The current selection is indicated by three bars at the top of the screen. But that's nothing new, since almost every TouchWiz handset offers that. In fact, the whole UI is the same as the youthful S3650 Corby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can fill up each of those homescreen panes with as many widgets as you like. The different wallpapers are actually three parts of a single panoramic desktop, just like on the Samsung S8000 Jet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case some of you have missed it, widgets are nifty mini-apps that reside on your home screen. Some of them seem to have more purpose, such as the calendar and world clock, image gallery or the mp3/radio players, while others range from fun to pointless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, all the TouchWiz widgets are stored in a tray running down the side of the screen, which you can pull in and out as needed using the small arrow in the lower left corner (or alternatively, by tapping on a blank space on the screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pick which widgets to display by simply dragging them onto the display and placing them where you want. If any need to be removed, you simply drag them back to the tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen and the new icon graphics aside, the rest of the M5650 Lindy interface is typical Samsung (or at least the latest revision seen on the Samsung Jet). You have a tab at the bottom of the display which holds the three context keys with varying functionality based on the currently active menu. There are also some nice animations and transition effects throughout the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a 3 x 4 grid of icons, while sub-menus appear as lists. The main menu itself, as on the Samsung S3650 Corby, stretches over three different screens and is sweep-scrollable sideways. The reason that so much more space was needed is the fact that almost all apps are now brought to the main menu, arranged in a flat iPhone-like structure. You will only need to dig deeper for the settings but if those were also brought to the fore, the main menu would most certainly have become a huge mess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like on the Samsung Jet, you can freely rearrange the items in te main menu to suite your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M5650 Lindy also supports multitasking, which means that Java applications can be minimized to run in the background. However, there is no hardware key to allow you to switch between the apps, which certainly makes multitasking much less of a treat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also enabled the M5650 Lindy with the Smart unlock feature, previously known as Gesture lock. Smart unlock allows users to simultaneously unlock the phone and open a menu item, application - even dial a contact - just by drawing a letter on the unlock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each letter from A to Z can be set as a gesture by the user to perform the various actions in question. For instance, you can use it to start apps like the music player, messaging menu, the web browser, Java apps or the dialing keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M5650 Lindy sports the Corby's cute little theme designed especially for this handset's young audience, part of the whole dynamic Cartoon UI thing that was much advertised by Samsung.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Samsung M5650 Lindy has it all. Up to 2000 contacts can be stored with multiple fields. It can display the names on the SIM card, the phone memory or both at once. Searching is done by gradual typing of the desired contact's name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite a number of different detail fields are available for each contact. You can store up to 5 numbers, 4 email addresses, URLs and so on. Each contact can also be assigned a specific ringtone and picture, as well as a note. You can even set a video as "caller's ID".</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M5650 Lindy is excellent at its main job - making calls - we experienced no reception or voice quality drops for the time of our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's not much to say about the dialer. You dial just like you would on any touch phone. There are three virtual buttons - phonebook, more and back. When you type a number or look it up in the contact list, by tapping More you can access options like voice call, video call, send message or add to phonebook. Of course you have the hardware call buttons too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the handset has no smart dialing, which could have saved the users some digging in the phonebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the dialer itself is not very interesting, there's a flashier way to dial. The Photo Contacts are shown as a stack of pictures. Tapping on a photo brings up a menu with options to start a voice call or send a message. The Photo Contacts have changed since the last implementation of the TouchWiz UI in the Jet and they now automatically store picture links to the most used contacts, just like in the Corby. The option to tag people's faces is no longer available. The feature makes more sense now as it's fully automatic and as long as you have assigned images to your contacts, you'll be alright.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for loudspeaker performance, the M5650 Lindy scored a very good mark. Here it is alongside some of the other devices we have tested. You can find more details about the test itself as well as the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Messaging does the job, still no virtual QWERTY<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you might expect, the Samsung M5650 Lindy handles all common message types. The handset has a shared editor for SMS and MMS and a separate one for emails. A rich T9 dictionary is at the user's disposal too. There is no landscape QWERTY keyboard available here, perhaps due to the small screen size. Still, we would have preferred it if users had the choice to make for themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a native email client. It does not have an option for automatical settings retrieval so we had to enter them manually, but once that's done, emailing is a breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The attachment limit for sending is 5MB, which is enough for most file types. If you receive an office document as an attachment, you will be able to view it as well thanks to the integrated office document viewer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social networking does the basic job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As promised, the M5650 Lindy comes with social integration disguised as four neat homescreen widgets - MySpace, Facebook, Twitter and Bebo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All four widgets have similar interface - a big update button at the top, a text field for your current mood/status message and some buttons at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the MySpace widget the available options include checking your messages, getting into chat and adding friends. The Facebook widget offers checking your messages, adding new friends and its last option is poking a friend. Finally, the Twitter widget has only two virtual keys - friends and followers. The Settings button is available everywhere offering options for auto-refresh and adding a photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you see, the widgets aren't exactly full of features, but the basics seem covered. They are more than enough to keep you connected to your social circle on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one problem though - the widgets can only use network data, not the wireless connectivity. It's not like they will involve a lot of traffic, but still you will need some kind of data plan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Social networking integration stretches even further to having a dedicated item in the main menu. The Communities item gets you links to websites such as Facebook, Picasa and Flickr and the ability to directly upload files. You can also preset your login details so you don't have to enter them each time you access those websites or try to upload content from the file manager - the M5650 Lindy stores your credentials for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That pretty much covers what Samsung have been doing in the social networking department. Unfortunately, there's no phonebook integration such as in the HTC Sense UI on the Hero and the HD2 or the MotoBLUR UI on the Motorola Dext.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No matter how limited, the controls available on the Samsung Lindy allow you to chat, update your status, post tweets, upload photos and read your friends' new posts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fast file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The M5650 Lindy's file browser can display the files and folders in the phone memory or the memory card, and both at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are folders for different types of files (images, video, sounds) to let the handset sort the memory contents. However, you are not forced to follow this structure - you can place your files wherever you want and the phone will have no problems handling them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can copy or move files - both one by one or in bulk, and you can create and delete new folders (except the root folders, like Images, Sounds and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files can also be sent via Bluetooth, one by one again, or in bulk. Throughout the whole file manager you can pick files you would like to lock to prevent accidental deletion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading the memory card is quick and won't bother users at all. Listing the thumbnails of pictures stored in the respective folder on the memory card is quite fast too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The initiatialization speed of the memory card is surprisingly fast: regardless of the capacity, the M5650 Lindy recognizes a memory card in 10-15 seconds. The phone comfortably handles a 16GB microSD card full of thousands of different files. Working with the files on the memory card once it's initialized is fast enough to satisfy most users; however, speed does drop when the card starts filling up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery is basic, but gets the job done<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike some previous Samsung devices like the S8300 UltraTOUCH and just like the S3650 Corby, the M5650 Lindy has only one picture gallery. However, the gallery it does have is fully functional. You'll most likely not miss the Photo browser despite its eye-catching qualities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The M5650 Lindy gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and launching it is as simple as opening any folder that contains images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open a picture to view, you can sweep your fingers across the screen to see the next image without having to return to the image list. Browsing the images is really fast and responsive with no lag thanks to the capacitive screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in is easy enough though not as responsive as we would have like it. You have the one-finger zoom but it kicks in after you spend some considerable amount of time (like 3 sec) touching the image with your thumb. From there on it's just a matter of dragging your finger up for zooming in and down for zooming out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a second zoom control which is more conventional - a zoom bar with thumbable icons that allows you to actually zoom with tapping instead of dragging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing images in landscape mode is also available. As there's no accelerometer for automatic rotation, you can switch to landscape view via the dedicated on-screen button.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player of the Samsung M5650 is exactly the same as in the Jet and Star and hasn't been altered much from the M8800 Pixon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It allows filtering tracks by author, album, and genre. Automatic playlists (recently added, most played etc.) are also generated and can subsequently be used as filters. If that doesn't seem enough, you can create your own custom playlists. The music player can naturally be minimized to play in the background. In that case though, you won't be able to control it with the hardware music keys unless you're on the homescreen. Another thing to note is the absence of virtual on-screen music buttons (skip, play, pause) in the music player interface. You get larger album art instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player also has a dedicated homescreen widget, allowing quick access to the full version of the application with only a single tap. The equalizer selection offers the standard presets like pop, jazz, classic, etc. but it also packs three additional options - widening, dynamic and surround effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last, but certainly not least, the player is nicely touch-optimized to include fast forward and rewind, just like on the S5600. This adds up to an excellent music application that can fully replace your portable MP3 player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M5650 Lindy features an FM radio with RDS. The M5650 Lindy's radio app offers intuitive controls and has the Find Music recognition service implemented, which works much like Sony Ericsson's TrackID.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio app is in the Applications menu but the Radio widget on the home screen gives you more immediate access. Tapping on it brings up the radio or you could just use the widget's controls to start/stop the radio or change the station. It can only skip between saved stations though, and if you want to search you'll have to do it in the actual app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of stations, you can save stations but they are labeled just by their frequency and you can't rename them. There's a separate list for your favorite stations though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Splendid audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of the Samsung M5650 Lindy is pretty fine and certainly that best that we have witnessed from Samsung recently. All readings rank as at least "good" by our books, while some are even downright excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is spot on for most of the range with the slight bend that you see at the graph below being mostly outside the audible frequencies. Unlike the Corby, the Lindy has great stereo crosstalk and near perfect distortion levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level and dynamic range are among the best we have seen so it makes up for quite a formidable package indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes the table and the graph so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung M5650 Lindy frequency response graph</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player is not something you will use often<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a simple interface with not too many features. All the basic are covered though, and that should really be enough as the screen size doesn't really lend itself to watching whole movies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports MP4 videos but we only managed to get QVGA samples running. The VGA resolution videos we tried were a no go.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M5650 Lindy features a 3 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also sports the nice Smile shot feature. Basically when it's on, pushing the camera button doesn't immediately result in taking the picture. Instead, the camera just starts tracking the framed face. As soon as the person smiles, the handset takes the shot for you automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is nicely touch-optimized and is certainly among the most comfortable camera interfaces on a touchscreen device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is not a spectacular performer, but it's perfectly acceptable for a 3 megapixel snapper. The iPhone 3GS doesn't really perform any better than the Lindy in this area. Image quality is pleasing, with good amount of resolved detail and spot-on white balance. Noise levels are good for the class and the only reason to possibly question the Lindy's photo quality is the slight lack of color saturation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Samsung M5650 Lindy. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video recording capabilities of the Samsung M5650 Lindy are very poor - it maxes out at QVGA@15fps. We guess the captured videos are good only for MMS purposes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample Samsung M5650 Lindy video recording for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3G and Wi-Fi connectivity more than welcomed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Lindy is usable worldwide with quad-band GSM support. It also packs 3G support at the 1900/2100 bands. With HSDPA it's perfectly ready for speedy network data transfers. For data-intensive tasks you also have the option to go through Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi manager is the standard Samsung one and will do the job perfectly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth is present and it is complete with A2DP support. The microUSB port for syncing and data transfers is also on board along with a 3.5 mm audio jack for the audiophiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In mass storage mode, it gives access to the memory card but not to the internal memory and you cannot use the phone for calls or data in this mode.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M5650 Lindy, like the Samsung S8000 Jet, features the new WebKit-based Dolfin web browser, which is an in-house application. With Flash support and the new one-finger zooming algorithm, it is one of the finest web browsers we have seen on a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one-finger zooming works like a charm too. Of course you can also rely on double tapping a block of text or an image and the handset will automatically zoom in to it. Another double tap and you are back to the previous zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to Flash and Java support, the new web browser also offers kinetic scrolling and fullscreen view. You can scroll by simply sweeping a finger across the screen. The actual scrolling is very choppy and is perhaps the only downside to browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flash support extends to include full featured YouTube videos as well but the Lindy processing power doesn't seem to allow watching them. Other than that web browsing on the Lindy is first rate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung M5650 Lindy has a number of useful time-management applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, the calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. You can choose which calendar view should be default and you can pick the starting day of the week - the options are Monday or Sunday. However, with the Samsung M5650 there is only a single type of event available in the calendar. You can set the starting date and time of the event and set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm is quite customizable. You can set up to 10 alarms, each with the following configurable options - custom ringtone, volume, repetition days and name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator of the Samsung M5650 is very basic. Among the other organizer offerings are a voice recorder, a world time application and a unit converter. The voice recorder limit is set to 60 minutes. A countdown timer and a stopwatch also come in useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also to-do and memo applications for jotting down tasks and notes. You can also use the memo widget to place a memo on the homescreen where you're unlikely to forget it. The widget and the application are separate so don't expect your memos to automatically pop up on screen. Oh, and there's a to-do widget as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Samsung M5650 comes with an office document viewer that supports Word, Excel, Powerpoint and PDF files. It's an application developed by Access and is one of the nicest additions to the software package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The document viewer is quick enough when opening files; however, panning is rather slow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The supplied apps are fairly typical rather than anything intriguing - an RSS reader, Last.fm and the popular Palringo Java IM client. The names of those speak for themselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Trial only games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical of Samsung lately, the M5650 Lindy offers only a bunch of trial games - Asphalt 4, DJMixTour, Crazy Penguin Catapult, Tetris Refresh, PacMan CE and Monopoly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite having a whole host of siblings looking over its shoulder, the Samsung M5650 Lindy just makes sense. It has everything that a modern touch device must offer and goes even further. But most importantly, it comes cheap. It keeps the simple and friendly Corby design, but adds Wi-Fi, HSDPA, a 3.5 mm audio port and dedicated music keys proving it's indeed Corby's better half.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no innovations on the Lindy. It just takes the best of the Corby spirit, mixes it with a dash of style and offers it to you at a really bargain price. A simple, affordable and attractive touchscreen with a premium feature set. It is designed to be a small and trendy handset with the ability to suit the social needs of youngsters and the listening habits of the music fans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lindy is part of Samsung's continuing effort to own the lower touchscreen segments. It seems budget minded-users have never had more choice of designs and feature sets. And the S3650 Corby claims much of the credit. It lacks Wi-Fi and the music goodies, but still offers all the social stuff and the hard-to-beat price. The Corby comes with three different Fashion jackets too to fit your every day styling, something that the Lindy lacks. But more importantly, the Corby has reproduced beyond belief.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking into the Samsung catalogue you get another of the M5650 Lindy's most likely prototypes - the S5230 Star Wi-Fi. With almost the same specs and price, but with different - more mainstream - design and a bigger (resistive) touchscreen, the Star Wi-Fi is selling fine just as well.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>If you need a budget touchscreen device you may want to look at the pioneer in this segment - the LG KP500 Cookie - pretty much the standard along with the Samsung Star for appeal, affordability, fun and ease of use. The Cookie has more basic features and costs a lot less. The LG GD510 Pop is the more up-to-date device and while it can't measure up to Lindy's feature set, the design may suit you better.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Talking of competitors, let's not forget one of the mid-range XpressMusic devices - the Nokia 5530 XpressMusic. Its price tag equals Lindy's and so does the feature set but you do get a Symbian smartphone. Another obvious option is the Nokia 5230, which swaps Wi-Fi for GPS.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>To sum it all up, we all liked the M5650 Lindy. The only thing it doesn't seem to have is perhaps looks to match the features. But we still think the design will be popular with the young. We would've called it Wendy though - it's a WLAN enabled handset after all. All right, Mandy for the music would be too much. But never mind the name. It's a phone that puts an easy price tag on some serious feature set. And that's hard to say no to.</paragraph>
