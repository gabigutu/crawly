			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Today we got a special Viewty deal &#x2014; two-for-the-price-of-one. The Snap and the Smile are nearly identical. One?s got a better camera, the other has 3G. It doesn?t look like a choice you?d want to make but let?s be honest here ? you won?t be spending a fortune on either of them. Design will be a decider as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GM360 Viewty Snap flaunts a 3? WQVGA touchscreen and a 5MP Schneider-Kreuznach-certified camera with LED flash. Social networking integration sweetens the pot, but the lack of 3G is a disappointment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty Snap has a distinct Chocolate flavor in the styling and, with a good still camera and SNS, it might edge out the LG KM570 Cookie Gig from the hearts of teens and tweens alike.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Viewty Snap over Viewty Smile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now it?s LG GT400 Viewty Smile?s turn ? almost the same hardware as the Smile, this time with faster data speeds. However the fancy label on the lens and the LED flash are gone, as is (rather strangely) the 3.5 mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll see what difference that Schneider-Kreuznach label makes, but the readily accessible microSD slot is instantly appreciated. The missing audio jack is another matter ? you have to use a USB headset with the Smile.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Viewty Smile over Viewty Snap<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Matte fingerprint resistant plastic and better looking buttons on the front score a point for the Smile. But it?s not just looks that separate the two ? if you spend a lot of time browsing (or use USB tethering), you?ll benefit a lot from the 3G connectivity, especially in the absence of Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, here they are ? so similar yet different enough to have potential buyers sitting on a fence. The LG Viewty Snap is for the younger crowd ? they take lots of photos, check their Facebook page a few times a day and carry around loads of music on their phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They will just have to bite the bullet and go back to the dark ages of EDGE. Not so with the LG Viewty Smile. It?s more neutral in features and styling, so it will appeal to a larger audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?ll let these two slug it out in the hardware part of the review and then go over the software. Keep in mind that both phones we?re testing are pre-release units and things might change in the final version.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GM360 Viewty Snap 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GM360 Viewty Snap measures 108 x 53.1 x 12 mm ? roughly the same dimensions as the KM900 Arena and KM570 Cookie Gig. The Viewty Snap is on the compact side of touch phones, without compromising screen size. At just 87 grams, it?s pretty lightweight too ? you won?t feel it in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s the breakdown of the Viewty Snap pros and cons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Viewty Snap key features</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Viewty Snap main disadvantages</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Viewty Snap design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GM360 Viewty Snap borrows some design elements from the Chocolate line ? the thin silver strip that runs down its side and the side buttons are straight from the New Chocolate phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Viewty Snap is built around two things ? the display and the camera, and both are pretty prominently featured by the styling of the phone. The display has a glossy plastic bezel that contrasts with the rest of the surface and the silver ring of the camera lens has the ?Schneider-Kreuznach? and ?Auto Focus? labels clearly visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen itself is a resistive 3-incher of WQVGA resolution ? the same specs as the KM570 Cookie Gig. Nothing phenomenal in terms of response, it is sensitive enough not to cause any problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is bright with good colors and viewing angles. The resolution is a quarter of what the Arena had, but it?s not a major problem. As for sunlight legibility, we?ve seen worse and we?ve seen much better ? direct sunlight is not this screen?s friend.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the display, the rest of the items of interest on the front are the earpiece (which doubles as a loudspeaker), the Call and End keys and the menu key. They are actual hardware buttons, which is what some people prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of LG GM360 Viewty Snap features the microUSB port, which is used for both charging and data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side there?s the volume rocker and the shutter key. The keys are as thin as the silver strip, meaning not all too comfortable to use. At least they are prominent enough and surprisingly clicky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the 3.5mm standard audio jack and the Power/Lock key. The power key is small and flush against the top. It?s still ok to use and accidental presses are unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no controls or connectivity ports at the bottom of the LG Viewty Snap, just the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backside is the home of the second main attraction of the LG Viewty Snap ? the 5MP camera with Schneider-Kreuznach lens and LED flash. The silver plastic ring around the camera looks cool but offers very little protection against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 900 mAh Li-Ion battery of the Viewty Snap is quoted at 300 hours of stand-by and 5 hours of talk time. It lasted us about a day and a half of testing and another couple of days of standby, which is about as much heavy users can expect from the Snap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is also placed under the battery cover but it is still hot-swappable. The LG GM360 Viewty Snap can easily handle a 16GB microSD card ? you get access to the card instantaneously, there?s no lengthy initialization period.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back, true to its New Chocolate muse, is piano black plastic that gets covered in smudges in no time. The shape and the silver accents on the side make the Viewty Snap a BL40 New Chocolate lookalike. The Viewty genes are more prominent at the rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looks and build quality are solid. The only complaint we have is the buttons under the display. They just look cheap. Other than that, the narrow, thin frame of the phone and its rounded corners make it comfortable to hold. It?s lightweight too, fitting any pocket with ease.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GT400 Viewty Smile 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GT400 Viewty Smile measures 107 x 54.5 x 11.8 mm ? almost exactly the same size as the Viewty Snap. It?s heavier though, at 98 grams. The finish is matte, with brushed-metal look, similar to the KM570 Cookie Gig. Fingerprints are much less of an issue here than on the Snap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s the Viewty Smile pros and cons breakdown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Viewty Smile key features:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG Viewty Smile main disadvantages:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Viewty Smile design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Visually, the LG GT400 Viewty Smile takes after the LG Arena and the Cookie Gig. It?s not exactly an attention grabber but it?s like a pair of jeans ? it goes with anything. The brushed metal finish on the back gives it a subtle sleek look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display on the LG Viewty Smile is practically the same unit as the one on the Snap ? a 3? WQVGA resistive touchscreen. The sensitivity is satisfactory and you can use the screen with gloves too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Good brightness, contrast and colors make the display pretty attractive looking although its resolution is nothing special. Still, it?s OK most of the time, failing only with text at very low zoom levels. Sunlight legibility is not particularly good much like the Viewty Snap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again, same as the Snap, the front of the LG Viewty Smile is populated by the earpiece that is also the loudspeaker, as well hardware menu key and call knobs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the GT400 Viewty Smile holds the microSD slot, which is covered by a plastic flap. It can handle 16GB microSD cards and there?s no initialization period, you can access the card right away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is pretty crowded. Starting at the top, there?s the microUSB port (again covered by a plastic flap). It has a triple function ? data port, charger plug and headphone jack. We really prefer the standard 3.5mm audio jack of the Snap over this setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Further down, you have the volume rocker ? a long press on the down volume button toggles the Silent profile (this actually works on the Snap as well). Below the volume rocker is the Lock/Hold key and the shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top is completely bare, while the bottom holds the mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the LG GT400 Viewty Smile hosts the 5 megapixel camera lens with no extras ? no LED flash or lens protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery of the Viewty Smile is quoted at 340 hours of stand-by and 3 hours and 30 minutes of talk time. That?s quite a bit lower than the Snap. Our test unit wasn?t behaving too well (battery kept dropping way too fast) so we can?t be sure on that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover has brushed metal finish but it?s made of plastic ? still, it?s pleasant to the touch and does a good job of concealing fingerprints, unlike the glossy plastic on the Snap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GT400 Viewty Smile is just 11.8mm thick and with a sub-100 gram weight it?s easily pocketable. It sits well in the hand, though the right side is a bit too labored ? all those controls aren?t very easy to use and your thumb has no controls to use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface has S-class looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The software on both the LG Viewty Snap and the Viewty Smile is traditional LG with some S-Class eye-candy. The homescreen has a widget page and a page for favorite contacts and the Snap also has a Livesquare homescreen that?s missing on the Smile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s start with the widget-enabled screen that allows you to arrange several mini applications as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A touch on the marker in the bottom right corner of the homescreen pulls out the Widget tray, which holds all of the currently unused widgets. You can choose the ones you want and drag them onto the screen or stash the ones you don't need back in the tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty Smile and Viewty Snap offer a clock widget, a mini FM radio, a mini music player, a Notes app, image slideshow, a calendar and a few others. The Snap has a Facebook widget too, we?ll get back to it when we look at the full Facebook app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s only one non-scrollable widget screen and the LG GM360 Viewty Snap has an additional limitation ? you can only use three widgets at a time. The LG GT400 Viewty Smile lets you have as many as you can fit on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, new widgets cannot be added. That?s the main disadvantage compared to the competing touch UIs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact homescreen doesn't work with widgets, but lets you arrange favorite contact icons instead. Again the two phones differ slightly ? the Viewty Snap lets you have up to 9 contacts, while the Viewty Smile can hold three panes of up to 6 contacts each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap a contact four buttons appear to the sides of the contact?s photo ? call, send SMS, Edit and remove from speed dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty Snap has a Livesquare ? check out our other LG Cookie Gig review for more details on that. It?s a practical concept with a rather childish implementation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Viewty couple makes use of a Task manager allowing you to run several Java and native applications simultaneously and effortlessly switch between them. It's complemented by a secondary "Favorite apps" tab that hosts a number of configurable shortcuts to various applications. There?re up to nine slots for shortcuts on the Snap and the Smile again beats it ? it lets you have as many as you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Status screen is something borrowed from the Android playbook ? tapping on any of the icons on the status row on top (next to the clock) opens up a screen with signal, battery and memory stats, and allows you to quickly toggle the ringing profiles, music player and Bluetooth. It?s not quite as useful as the Android solution, but as close as a feature phone can get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GM360 Viewty Snap comes with a Social Network menu, which lists Orkut, Facebook, Twitter, Picasa, Flickr and MySpace. However only Facebook and Twitter have apps, the rest are simply bookmarks to the respective sites. Facebook gets a widget too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook application is custom-made and nicely touch optimized. Its interface feels quite familiar, so you can get going straight away. While the widget only shows the last couple of status updates, the app can handle the rest of the functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook widget shows status updates from your friends and serves as a shortcut to the full-blown Facebook application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Twitter app on the other hand is a Java app with smallish controls. It?s not the most thumb-friendly app we?ve seen, but it?s a full-featured Twitter client. You can post tweets, read other peoples? tweets including a special section for @replies and search is enabled as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony and messaging are nice<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A few quick words about the telephony and messaging. Both the Viewty Snap and the Viewty Smile have good reception and the in-call sound was loud and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones support Smart dialing, but the Snap is more advanced. It looks for both names and numbers, while the Smile looks at just numbers (almost-useless ).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call the screen is locked ? you have to unlock it manually as there?s no proximity sensor to take care of that automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The messaging department on both devices is fairly straightforward. Email setup was automatic (just enter email address and password) though it suffered from restrictive file size limitations (you can?t send or receive files much bigger than 2MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between an on-screen keypad in portrait or a QWERTY keyboard in landscape (on the Smile they switch automatically thanks to the accelerometer, but Snap users have to do it manually) and there?s handwriting recognition too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the LG Viewty Snap and Smile for day-to-day telephony was fine in both cases. Here's how they rank in our loudspeaker test:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player leaves little to be desired ? you can filter tracks by artist, album and so on, the Snap shows track info on the homescreen, while the Smile offers alternative visualizations when there?s no album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another feature that the Smile has but the Snap doesn?t is the music recognition service. Both phones have equalizer presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried out the video players too ? but they only managed low resolution 3GP and MP4 files. There?s no DivX/XviD video support and playing of videos with resolution higher than the screen res.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GM360 Viewty Snap did reasonably well in our audio quality test, achieving some good readings. The GT400 Viewty Smile was also decent, but its stereo crosstalk is so bad that it is an actual deal-breaker. Even when you use it as audio source for external amplifiers (such as a car or home stereo) and there is no resistance applied, it fails to separate the two channels big time. There's little doubt that the microUSB port used for its audio output doesn't help either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, bear in mind we have pre-production samples here, so retail units may have that pesky issue solved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GM360 Viewty Snap doesn't have similar issues although its stereo output worsens a bit when headphones come into play. Still, it's a solid performer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG GT400 Viewty Smile and LG GM360 Viewty Snap frequency response graphs</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browsers - EDGE vs. HSDPA<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browsers on the two Viewties are nice ? the page rendering is very accurate and text remains readable at fairly low zoom levels. There?s support for up to two tabs, you can save pages for offline viewing, search on page, toggle fullscreen and landscape views. The LG Viewty Snap adds text reflow ? it reflows the text to fit the screen from side to side at any zoom level, which improves readability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you do get the Snap though, be warned ? loading large uncompressed pages over EDGE is rather slow. You might want to consider installing Opera Mini. The LG Viewty Smile with its 3G and HSDPA goes noticeably faster.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two Viewty cameras<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the LG GT400 Viewty Smile and the GM360 Viewty Snap feature a 5 megapixel auto-focus camera for a maximum image resolution of 2592x1944 pixels. The Snap adds a Schneider-Kreuznach certified lens and a LED flash to the mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is identical on both and the same as on other LG phones (the only difference is the flash toggle). You can access all camera settings via a toolbar in the viewfinder. There you get virtual buttons for zooming, exposure, macro mode, resolution along with an advanced settings key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right hand-side of the viewfinder is another bar with a virtual shutter key and a slider to switch between still camera and camcorder. Alongside are the exit and gallery buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left toolbar can be hidden and brought back with a tap on the screen. It leaves an empty black stripe when hidden, unless you choose the fullscreen viewfinder option (which crops parts of the scene).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both Viewty phones have the basic settings ? ISO, exposure compensation, macro and a few color effects. There?s no face or smile detection, blink detection, geotagging or any other high-end features. The LED flash on the Snap gives it an edge over the Smile although the Smile has scenes presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure enough, the LG GM360 Viewty Snap is the better performer of the two ? as it should, with that Schneider-Kreuznach label. It?s among the generally good 5MP cameraphones, with pleasing colors and contrast, but it could use some more tweaking before launch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a fair amount of digital noise and while the software processing does a very good job of keeping it down, it does take its toll on the fine detail. Sharpening is overdone and creates some artifacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GT400 Viewty Smile doesn?t do as well as its counterpart. Depending on how LG fine-tunes the camera software before launch, things might improve though. Right now, there?s a pretty strong yellow tint. It doesn?t get close to the level of resolved detail of the Snap either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The oversharpening isn?t as strong and the noise is at the same levels as the Snap ? we?ll have to wait for the final version to see if software tweaks can bring the Viewty Smile within shouting distance of the Snap.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Poor video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both the Viewty Snap and the Viewty Smile shoot video in QVGA resolution. That alone is enough to file it under ?hopeless?. The Smile managed 20 frames per second, while the Snap maxed out at just over 10. This probably means they are not quite ready for primetime yet, so we?ll reserve final judgment until we get our hands on retail units.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GM360 Viewty Snap has one neat trick though. LG Marketing calls it Optic-all zoom, which allows the Snap to do digital zoom (up to 2x) without loss in image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Traditional digital zoom takes a part of the frame by cropping it and then upsizes it by using interpolation to artificially increase the resolution to the advertised output. This results in blurriness and no actual added detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead, Optic-all zoom for still pictures works by simply cropping the image without the interpolation part. That's not bad really, as that way you crop the scene straight in the camera, and you don't need to do it on a computer or via the clumsy on-board image editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, cropped still images aren't something that can excite geeks like us. The place where the Optic-all zoom shebang gets really interesting is in the video camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming while shooting video still produces the nominal video resolution but it has the benefit of not losing any quality or details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way they probably do it is via technology known as pixel binning. We have the same thing in the high-end Nokia N8, for instance. This is how it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've got a 5 megapixel sensor inside the Viewty Snap, while the video resolution is only a fraction of that. So when they use the whole surface of the sensor to shoot those videos, they've got a lot more pixels on information than they can use. The processing algorithm combines the information of adjacent pixels so you end up with the resulting lower resolution video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you zoom in, the camera starts using only the central portion of the sensor effectively magnifying the image you see but still getting proper resolution since the number of pixels in the center of the sensor is still more or equal to the resolution of the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is a great idea overall - however it is wasted on the LG Viewty Snap. Sure, its camcorder doesn't lose resolution when zooming in, but the QVGA video resolution is already pretty low. Throw in the heavy compression and the low frame rate and the point of optic-all zoom becomes almost nil.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the video sample and keep an eye on the fence - as you zoom in you can actually see more detail. If you can see through the compression artifacts that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's a still image from that video demonstrating the difference between Optic-all zoom and regular digital zoom used elsewhere.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s too early for any definitive conclusions just yet. The LG GM360 Viewty Snap has the better camera, offers social networking support and the convenience of a standard 3.5mm audio jack. For the younger crowd, this is the better combo of the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it dwells in the slow world of EDGE. If you?re thinking of some serious browsing or USB tethering, the LG GT400 Viewty Smile obviously has the upper hand. The matte, fingerprint-resistant plastic and easily accessible microSD card are points in its favor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Snap and the Smile give a satisfying touch phone experience ? there?s widgets, a good enough browser, easy email setup, office document viewing and multitasking. They won?t replace the LG GC900 Viewty Smart, but on the affordable touch phone front they are a good step up from the Cookie and an alternative to the KM570 Cookie Gig.</paragraph>
