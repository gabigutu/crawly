			<paragraph>Siemens S65 is a very long expected business phone; number 1 of the German producer. It's earnest and conservative. S65 is heavily loaded with the functions, featuring an integrated megapixel camera and a memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens S65 stands among the three most expected mobile phones of the last half a year, besides Nokia 6230 and Sony Ericsson K700. And it will be still these three mobiles, if the producers won't introduce some other earthshaking model. The Siemens expectancy is very strong also due to the fact that we've been waiting for a new highest class model very long - the previous model Siemens S55 came to the market year and a half ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While Nokia and Sony Ericsson models attract mainly with multimedia and entertaining functions, Siemens goes a different way. S65 is primarily a phone for business: earnest and conservative, you won't find much entertainment there. It's not a proper phone for people who appreciate e.g. wide choice of music functions but on the other hand there are many people who are looking for a business phone and which explicitly reject the multimedia and entertaining functions of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Siemens S65 is not a real killjoy; it features an integrated megapixel camera.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design: from scratch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Siemens phones are recognizable at first sight. Designers are mainly using old concepts, slightly enriched with some modern components. Siemens S65 seems redesigned from scratch; I don't see any influence of the older model concepts. The phone presents an elegant combination of a bright and black design with dark (inversive) graphic themes on the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear phone surface of is all silver; dark components prevail on the front. The phone is made of plastic; both handsets that I had were absolutely solid. No creaks, no squeaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens S65 is very thin which makes it look smaller, although with its height and width it ranks among bigger phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see on the picture with Nokia 7610 model, there is not such a big difference in size; and Nokia is a Symbian smartphone. But don't worry, size of 109 x 48 x 18 mm is normal and Siemens S65 will get into every pocket. Weight of 98 grams is also slightly above the average but it's not necessary to be criticized for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's compare competing phones by their size and weight:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset is bar shaped; its bottom part is narrowing a bit from a frontal view - but less than the decorative slats among the key columns indicate. Edges are just slightly rounded in contrast to the noticeably rounded handset head.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display: really big<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display is dominant, same as with other models from the 65 series: CX65 and M65. It features surface of thirteen square centimeters and there is not many regular phones with a bigger display. I've made a summary of similar handsets:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens S65 features the largest display from all these phones but what Motorola E398 or Sony Ericsson K700i can display in width, Siemens S65 can display only on height. Only Nokia 6230 features worse resolution but it's compensated with its small display. Last column in the table shows how many pixels go on a square centimeter of the display and here Siemens S65 is far behind the other compared phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is simply rough and it's evident also at a glimpse. It doesn't really matter with font, which is clear and big enough. The problem comes up with graphics, e. g. icons of the main menu or pictures. Lower resolution decreases attractiveness of Siemens S65, even though it's not "service affecting", but notable when you compare it with the new Sony Ericsson K700, higher class Motorola or Samsung mobiles. Siemens already used a poor display for its older S55 model. Despite that S65 model features an incomparably better display, it's still not winning our praise (let's hope that Siemens is going to introduce an enhanced successor earlier than in two years).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is active, displays up to 65k colors and is the same as with Siemens M65 and CX65 models. It has efficient illumination and you can look at it from acceptably wide angle. Reflexive background and inverse graphic themes help on the daylight; the display is sufficiently clear.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad look: as made of glass<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keypad takes approximately one third of the front surface. Numeric keys are broad enough, but their height is smaller than usual. To differ single rows of keys, Siemens milled 2mm grooves between them, so less space remains for the keys themselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have to get used to typing, I was fighting with typing errors sometimes; the keypad block should be a bit higher. Some keys, mainly in the bottom row, are swinging but with no impact on typing. Keys are made of a solid material; you'll appreciate the proper press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Soft keys are placed just below the display. They are not attached on each other and control goes well with them. Concretely there are two keys with call functions, two soft keys with three dots and a key below the joystick. This key is assigned to access WAP and it's not possible to change it. When you return back to the menu, e.g. to the messages, to-do list or notes, the phone offers you to continue your work, so you won't lose anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The five directional joystick is accurate, Siemens embedded it below the level of the surrounding surface. There is a circle hollowed out around the joystick but just to tease it is not enough, you must press it with your finger. Pressing the joystick opens the main menu, single directions have fixed assigned functions: address book, camera, ringing profiles and events list (messages, missed calls etc.)</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What else?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the phone you can find only infrared port, rocker switch is placed untraditionally on the right side. You control the volume during a call with it, but in a standby mode both its directions are used for running the set functions. Down direction is assigned as default to the camera, up direction can be set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign a special function also to both soft keys and to numeric keys 2-9. Siemens is still using quite illogical way of activation, by holding the button or pressing it twice. By pressing it once shortly it runs the selection of set function. I've never understood why it's not conversely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The black component with a well in the upper part of the handset is used for placing the phone in the holder. The outlet for fixing a strap is in the bottom part; you can get there when you remove the rear cover. Under the cover you'll see a Li-Ion battery and a SIM card under the battery - contrary to some of the previous Siemens phones it's removable. I can't say more than the official values about the battery duration: in standby mode the phone lasts up to 250 hours or you can call for 300 minutes. Battery gets fully charged in about two hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>External antenna connector is defacing the back part of the phone; Siemens should cover it with some suitable plug. In the middle there is a digital camera lens. Cover slide of the lens is hidden deep under the surrounding surface; I wonder how hard will it be to clean it from possible dirt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>System connector is the same as with other new Siemens phones. Above the connector there is a small door that many people discussed about, when there were only pictures with no technical specification available. The memory card goes there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What is the purpose of the memory card?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Siemens S65 is using a memory card of Reduced Size MMC special format as well as Nokia 7610 does. It's an usual MMC card, just reduced on a half size. It goes hard in the slot and it's even harder to get it out - it's placed quite deep inside, and moreover, you have to press it to get over the catch. Owing to the hundred percent compatibility and slot placement it's possible to use also normal MMC cards. Half of the card will stick out from the phone, but it will work. That's the advantage over Nokia 7610, where the card is hidden behind the battery thus ordinary MMC format can't get in there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch cards in Siemens S65 on the go - but what for? I know that we criticized phones, and especially the older Siemens S55, for a low memory, and now I'm going to reprove the unlimited memory of the newest model. What is the purpose of a memory card in such a phone? Siemens S65 is not equipped with a player of MP3 files, which to be saved on a card. It's used only for pictures. Sure, with a megapixel camera the size of every picture is 100-150 kilobytes, but I think the internal memory of more than 10 MB should be quite enough?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera: more colors please<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The megapixel camera in the mobile phone is still a very important new feature. Siemens S65 is one of the first phones equiped with such camera. Siemens features also a bigger resolution than Nokia 7610: 1280 x 960 pixels versus 1152 x 864 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our previous article where we compared two megapixel photomobiles, Siemens S65 and Nokia 7610, we were more critical to Siemens S65. But then we got a new phone and the latest firmware and things have changed. The point is that Siemens S65 has two types of optics: one is making pictures in a quality that we criticized in the article and the other one makes photos of a better quality. Firmware is also quite important for the picture quality. With the final product - in the phones that are being sold - you can be always sure that you have the right optics type and the actual firmware (unfortunately we weren't lucky with our test phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So once again: comparison of megapixel photos made by Siemens S65 and Nokia 7610. Both phones are final market samples with the actual firmware. We took the same scenes in same conditions and now you can compare with us:  Comparison of the photographic abilities of Siemens S65 and Nokia 7610. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera settings possibilities aren't poor at all. You can choose from five types of resolutions, use the exposure compensation and also max. 5x zoom, which works on the basis of crops from a bigger format. The camera features a self timer, three possible settings for the color balance, monochrome and sepia effects. Pictures can be stored in the interanl phone memory or on the memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Space for pictures is available in the phone ? and on the memory card ? pictures are under control thanks to simple files manager</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens S65 can also record a video with max resolution of 176 x 144 pixels. The video can't be stored on the memory card and it can't be longer than 15 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Video finder is the same as for a photo mode ? you use color balance also in video mode </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Environment and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Older Siemens 65 series phones have had very unusual graphical environment. Main menu icons look like drawn by a child and probably no one could imagine that also the serious S65 model would use the same graphics. Don't worry, it doesn't. Main menu icons are "normal", they really represent what do you think they would. In standard they are black and white, by selection they get colored orange and start lightly pulse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The low display resolution makes no good for the icons. Oblique lines are noticeably jagged. Now I don't really mind but at first contact with the phone, and after the experiences with better displays, it was quite a bad surprise. There is plenty of space for wallpapers on the main display. Besides a wallpaper you can find the usual information there, it shows date and time as a standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Environment of the phone can be changed by use of the graphical themes. I find the standard theme the nicest, an inverse image with white text on a dark border. Other themes are too mottled. Inverse image is better than a black font on a light background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screensaver starts after a preset time. You can choose among "switch off", analog or digital clock showing actual time or a picture, e. g. an animated gif. The phone offers also the possibility to lock the keys by activating the saver, and to ask eventually for a code to return back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During switching off and on the phone, you can hear an ugly sound, ear-splitting beep. You don't have to worry, it's possible to turn off all sounds of this type. Siemens S65 is a very fast phone. In comparison to Nokia 6230, which is probably the fastest phone of the class, it's a bit slower, reactions have a small delay, but overall the phone is fast.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone performance is very similar to the Siemens M65 and CX65. Siemens goes the same way as other producers do and offers the same features - just in a new design. What does this mean? If you don't need Bluetooth and a phone with very attractive design, you can buy e.g. Siemens CX65 and save quite nice amount of money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound during a call is excellent: nice bass sound, you won't hear any disturbing tones. It should be a bit louder for I can imagine an environment where volume can be insufficient. The same stands for the loud speaker - sound quality is brilliant, could be just louder. The phone is tri-band, besides the European frequency bands 900/1800 MHz it supports also 1900 MHz band.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By testing previous Siemens 65 series phones I wasn't completely sure whether they will finally feature a voice recorder. Trying to use this function during a call the phones got blocked; they weren't loaded with the final firmware. It's clear with Siemens S65 and also with his relatives: recording during call is not possible, the phone gives you a warning. Similarly the Siemens phones offer neither a voice dialing nor voice functions control.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siemens S65 features an excellent address book. Again you can choose whether you want to use a SIM card or a phone directory, but it's easy to take decision. The phone can contain up to thousand structured records. You can assign following attributes to every person:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's pretty complete, don't you think? I'll write some words about the group of callers function. There are eight of these groups in the phone, you can rename them and assign them a symbol that is displayed during a call (but if a picture is assigned to the name, the phone displays the symbol just for a while). In the other menu, "on the opposite side of the phone", it is possible to set an individual ringing tone for every group. Then the ringing profiles allow you to filter the groups - to select one to ring and other just to blink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A concrete ringing tone is not assigned to the ringing profiles. You have to use the common menu for that, but you can select a ringing mode (yes, no, beep), volume for different situations (calls, messages, alarm etc.), vibrations mode from six possible options, turn on the sound of keys, set a display illumination level and also an upper case. Five profiles which can be edited, are prepared right in the phone, and other two you can set from the beginning by yourselve. The last profile is meant for use in an airplane, the phone is switched off, including all set reminders or alarms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Selection of a ringing profile ? setting a selected profile</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the selection of ringing tones you can choose among monophonic (but ear-splitting) sounds in non-standard SRT format and of course you can use also polyphonic MID diles. Siemens S65 offers polyphony with 40 channels. It supports also AMR and WAV formats. It's not possible to use an MP3 file as a ringing tone and Siemens have forgotten also the excellent MMF sounds. Ringing quality is just average: you can hear the sound well but it's short of basses. The vibration is strong but extremely noisy for quiet warnings on calls and messages.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages of all sorts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Siemens knows everything: SMS, EMS and MMS messages, it has an integrated email client and also an instant messaging client for sending fast messages. It features also T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All functions are located in the messages menu. To create a new message you choose first what type of message do you want to create - incoming messages are sorted by type in different folders. As with other 65 series models you can select a font size for writing from three sizes; your choice has no impact on reading the incoming messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Message writing goes well with Siemens S65, the editor is fast enough, there are no delays in displaying the characters. You can also use the copy/paste function and thanks to the EMS support it's possible to format the text a little. Producers should come to an agreement, under which key the special characters will be. It's a nightmare always to search for space, dash, dot, comma or slash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multimedia messages editor also hasn't changed compared to the M65 or CX65 models. MMS messages can contain more pages and can include pictures, video, text, sounds; you can also select a layout of the items on the page. The email client is identical with the one in Siemens CX65. Working with emails is comfortable; it offers complete support of attachments: for sending and for receiving.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone memory can contain up to 100 text messages, which can be moved to the archive. Archive is limited only by the remaining memory. Multimedia messages and emails are saved to he internal memory.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizing time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone has one repeated alarm clock, allowing you to choose among days when it wakes you up and when it gives you a break. If you don't set the Airplane ringing profile, the alarm will start even if the phone is switched off. Somebody would appreciate the possibility to set time when the phone automatically switches off. There is one disadvantage: the phone can't switch on by itself. By the way, when you switch the phone on, you have to confirm that you're serious - just like with other Siemens phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I really enjoy the calendar in the new phones. Large display can show entire month view and moreover there is still some space to show the information about meetings in relevant days. A week view is also available, with similar attributes and a day detail, where events are sorted by hours. You can enter up to 1000 items in the calendar, which is sufficient for Outlook synchronization. You can delete expired events up to date, if you need so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For entering a new event you can choose from the following items:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although graphical calendar is really clear, users will often appreciate a simple text overview of meetings, sorted by date and time. It's also possible to assign a priority to the tasks and mark the finished ones. As in the calendar, here you can also choose among several types of events: Memo, Calls, Meeting and Voice record, Vacation and Birthday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Inserting a new record ? setting a reminder ? to-do-list ? entering a new task with a high priority</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's possible to record notes in the phone in total length of several hours. I have about six megabytes of free memory in the phone right now and I can still record 170 minutes. That's the way to use shared memory - other producers should get inspired. It would be perfect if the phone would let you save the records right on the memory card. Records are saved under a name that contains date and time of recording, but you can rename them after.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notes function is used for writing short texts. Unfortunately, the length limits every note up to 160 characters, which is very little and I don't understand why it's not possible to write longer texts. Selected notes can be hidden in a Secret folder where you can get them after entering a password.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calculator is in fact a Java app. It looks simple at first sight; memory is the only one special function there. But you can also display the advanced mode where you can use a power and a radix. Don't forget that the calculator ignores mathematical operations priorities. Straight from the calculator menu you can start a Units convertor, which can be started also from the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch seems to be very simple, but only until you find out that it's possible to split time with the side button (you can insert two split-times). Countdown timer function gives you a warning for preset time. You just enter the time, start the countdown and wait for the sound signal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Calculator ? units convertor ? countdown timer ? stopwatch can split timeThe 10 megabytes of memory are, like in a PC, split in the tree structure of folders and files. You can access it from the phone in two ways. They look the same, but with Files system selection you'll get to more of the folders than by My files in the main menu. There you'll find special folders for pictures, video, animations, sounds, graphical themes, games, applications and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can take a look at the files either in a text list form or you can display a preview. That makes sense only with pictures, but the general use is questionable, because there are no labels at the previews, so you'll see maybe nine identical folder icons. The file manager gives you the possibility to work with files: copy, move and delete, you can select more of them and then perform the required operation at once. Selected item can be also sent directly: in MMS, via email, Bluetooth or infrared port. The memory card is displayed in the File manager as a folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course Siemens S65 supports Java MIDP 2.0, which has found its use in three integrated games and five other applications. The first of the offered games is called Sea Battle, which is a digital form of the classic boats battle on a squared paper, well known from our early school years. Next you can race in a car in Siemens 3d Rally and the third game is Worms, sort of aggressive game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the applications, inside you'll find a Photo Editor used for editing photos from the integrated camera. The Download Assistant application makes downloading to the phone easier, and the Emergency Phonebook application is an address book of the emergency lines, perhaps from all the countries in the world. Survival Dictionary is a dictionary application, which "speaks" German, English, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, and can help you orientate yourself in the basic signs and phrases while traveling abroad. The last application available is a pictorial Cocktail Manager, which will help you with preparing cocktails.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data functions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new WAP browser that Siemens uses in the new series is very fast. It gives you many setting possibilities, up to now I wasn't successful to connect to Internet via APN. From mobile data transfer technologies you'll prefer GPRS class 10 (4+2) to slow data connection (CSD). Don't expect HSCSD, EDGE or WDCMA in this pone. Siemens S65 can be connected with a PC via Bluetooth, infrared port or a cable. It's the third use of a Bluetooth technology in Siemens phones, and alike with the S55 model Bluetooth cannot be active simultaneously with infrared port - activation of one of these switches off the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you will feel helpless how to transfer a call from the phone to a bluetooth headset, mark the small icon with a question mark at the left soft key. Just press it. Anyway, I was not successful again to set the phone to transfer a call automatically to connected bluetooth handsfree. Setting the phone for data transfer - now I mean WAP, email and MMS - is quite difficult due to a TCP/IP and WAP transfer support. Therefore I recommend to use an internet service, that will send you a configuration SMS after entering some specifications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>PC connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a CD included in the package, which contains a Mobile Phone Manager program. With this program it's possible to easily and comfortably work with the address book, text messages or the calendar etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As I already wrote, Siemens S65 can be connected via Bluetooth, an infrared port or a data cable. The phone connected to a PC via Bluetooth can use the services of the Mobile Phone Manager Application. The same stands for the infrared port as well. Of course, it's possible to connect a PC to the Internet via Bluetooth or Infrared port. Calendar, address book or organizer data can be synchronized by SyncML technology.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Designed for business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Compared to the other models of the Siemens 65 series, the highest S65 model is nothing new. But we should look more behind and compared to the previous Siemens S55 it presents a revolutionary change: in design, display quality, memory, telephony functions, messaging and organizer. Sure, it shouldn't take such a long time but we can't do anything about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Do you remember, what I began with? Siemens S65 is a highest-class mobile phone, designed for business. The only pure entertaining function, the megapixel camera, will just look nice in the ads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the phone that many users called for. Siemens developed the functions, which are necessary and didn't focus on modern useless things. The new S65 model has a huge address book, refined organizer functions and supports various types of messages. It's well equipped for mobile data transfer. And if 10 megabytes of memory aren't enough, there is a memory slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, I mention the relative Siemens M65 and CX65 phones, which are from the function point of view almost identical to the tested S65. They differ only in details and by design. You can save a lot of money by choosing the right phone (do you know now why CX65 doesn't have Bluetooth?).</paragraph>
