			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the tablet market reaching near-saturation, another slab that's just as thin, light and powerful as the rest of them will hardly bring crowds to the stores. Every maker is desperate to get some breathing space but few dare look for a space to call their own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick to take a gamble, Samsung is trying a new size again but this time around it's not what you would call a vacant niche that the Koreans are to develop. The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 has the scene set for its arrival by the LG G Pad 8.3 but it's actually two generations of iPad minis that the new Samsung slate is keener to meet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Is there a bit of arrogance in that? Well, there may be but the new Pro lineup means business like never before. It isn't just a hardware upgrade hiding behind the same old Android/TouchWIz combo either. The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is vying to put Samsung's compact range of tablets back on the map - done playing second fiddle to the Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has completely redesigned the TouchWiz user interface with a brand new homescreen and notification area, a new way of handling widgets, advanced multi-tasking with multi-view and floating apps. There's even a new business-grade office package. And although there is still Android KitKat below the magazine-like UI, the whole thing feels fresh and new.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is little the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 fails to provide, and it will make up for it with great software and usability skills. There are so many new features and improvements over the old version of TouchWiz that we can't wait to show you everything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But before we dig into the operating system and its interface, let's take a closer look at the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4's design and controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality, controls and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 utilizes the popular faux-leather-look plastic for the back, which Samsung premiered on the Galaxy Note 3 phablet. This may as well spiral into another wave of overused designs but we are still fond of these looks and we don't mind it being reused (for now).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is the first mid-sized tablet from Samsung we meet in a really long time and its main rival is the latest iPad mini 2. The Tab Pro 8.4 footprint is close to that of the Apple's slate, with the different display aspects causing most of the difference. The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 spreads at 219 x 128.5 x 7.2 mm, which is 19 mm taller, 6 mm narrower and just a notch thinner than the iPad mini 2. The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and iPad mini 2 both weigh exactly 331 g and that might be more than just a coincidence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 introduces an important control change compared to the Samsung slates of old - the capacitive Menu key is gone, replaced by Android's standard Task Switch control. Samsung has completely overhauled the task switcher and task manager, taking the tablet's multi-tasking capabilities to a whole new level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty much the same and the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 looks like an upsized Galaxy Note 3. The default orientation of the slate is assumed to be the portrait one, just like with a phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen you get the ambient-light sensor and the 2MP front-facing camera and bellow, there's the Android control deck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack is on top, while the microphone, Lock/power key, the volume rocker and the IR blaster are on the right. The right side also accommodates the lonely microSD port, covered by a small plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 has the microUSB 2.0 port, flanked by the stereo speakers. There's no microUSB 3.0 port here, unlike the Note 3 smartphone. Still, the 2.0 port on the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is MHL-enabled so it can serve as a TV-out and also supports USB On-The-Go for connecting external USB accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the 8MP camera and a LED flash are at the back of the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4. There is a metal frame around the camera lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 can be held comfortably with one hand and operated with the other. It's thin, light and provides great grip because of its faux-leather plastic back. The material also feel great to the touch. Even though it's no actual leather, the feeling is quite close, taking the overall experience up a notch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also deserves praise for not compromising on the build quality. We think everyone will appreciate the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 great handling and solid construction.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 8.4" Super Clear LCD on the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is one of the highest spec'd tablet screens to date. Along with some of its stalemates it has the highest resolution available in the mobile world and thanks to its smaller screen it has the highest pixel density of all slates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolution of 1600x2560 pixels is higher than the iPad mini 2's (1536 x 2048 pixels) and adds up to a best-in-class pixel density of 356ppi (as opposed to 324ppi on the iPad mini 2). The Galaxy Tab Pro also has a regular RGB matrix, unlike its 12.2 sibling, meaning there are not going to be any crosshatch patterns visible here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The RGB matrix of the Tab Pro 8.4's screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numbers aside, the image quality is excellent. Viewing angles are amazing and blacks look really deep. The outdoor visibility is great too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our usual display tests on the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and here are the results:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is powered by a 4800 mAh Li-Ion battery. By Samsung's estimates, it should give you 127 hours of music playback and 11 hours of multimedia usage. We did our own tests too, and the tablet managed 7 hours and 23 minutes of video playback and 7 hours and 43 minutes of web browsing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Magazine UI is your new homescreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 runs on the latest available Android 4.4.2 KitKat version, but Samsung's customizations run so deep, you'll barely recognize Google's platform underneath it all. Unlike previous slates or smartphones, the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 doesn't come only with TouchWiz UI, but also with a brand new Magazine UI for its homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Magazine UI is an evolved version of what we saw on the Galaxy Note 3 as My Magazine. Back then it was little more than a clone of the once Samsung-exclusive Flipboard app for Android. Now it's a fully functional replacement for you homescreen that does way more than just feed you news and social updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 brings four major changes to Android - the brand new Magazine UI for your homescreen, a completely redesigned notification area, an impressive new version of multi-tasking the Samsung proprietary multitasking feature called Multi Window, and updated system apps. Another change that we had to get used to is the lack of a capacitive Menu key. That one has been replaced by Android's standard Task Switcher shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slate has a very familiar lockscreen that supports multiple widgets. There is also the familiar app drawer that can stack your apps in folders or even hide apps that you don't use. So far so good. Now comes the interesting part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen interface has been completely changed since our last tour with the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition. Now, there are two type of homescreens - Magazine and TouchWiz. Having at least one Magazine pane is obligatory, while the TouchWiz panes are optional. Samsung is really dead set on making this work, but we don't really mind as it really looked better than the default screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Magazine pane would hold up to six widgets, but those widgets always occupy the whole screen - there is no background or docked shortcuts as you are used to seeing on all other Androids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Magazine's widgets are completely different from what you have seen so far on Android. They use flat looks ala Windows Phone, they can be easily resized, or they resize automatically in portrait and landscape orientation of the slate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available set of widgets is what really makes the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 and its Magazine UI so functional. The Magazine widgets are a mixture between various content aggregators (news, social services, multimedia), powerful mini versions of system apps and just nicely designed shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The content aggregators support news from a lot of categories (business, design, movies, food, music, sports, politics, travel, tech, etc.) and social services (500px, Facebook, Twitter). You can choose the specific topics for each Magazine widget. The widgets are flappable just like the Flipboard UI and you don't need to leave your Magazine homescreen pane to check out several stories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aggregators aside, the rest of the widgets give you quick access to the most used apps - gallery, office, hubs, calendar, weather and multimedia players. Finally, you have two different widgets that hold your Favorite and Frequently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have up to three Magazine homescreen panes. We guess this is due to hardware limitation, because those Magazine widgets probably eat a lot of resources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have standard homescreens as well. You can add app shortcuts there plus the standard Android widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling between the content-laden homescreens is still quick - first, you go through the Magazine panes and then through the TouchWiz ones. It's a looped scrolling process, so once you reach the last homescreen you'll go back to the first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose whichever homescreen you prefer to be the tablet's default one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last two new elements of the user interface are the notification area and the task switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has gained an additional Volume scrubber and Volume shortcut next to the brightness slider. All icons have been refreshed, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those aside, the area hasn't changed too much - you get a tiny S Search shortcut next to the clock and date, a row with scrollable toggles, a Settings shortcut and the actual expandable notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switching interface is intact, it just utilizes better the new resolution and doesn't occupy the whole screen. The powerful task manager is also onboard and allows you to kill apps, clean RAM, or uninstall downloaded apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multi Window multi-tasking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has improved tremendously its Multi Window multi-tasking feature. To access this feature you must enable it from settings. Then you can open its menu from anywhere in the UI by a left swipe from the right edge of the screen. There you would find all the apps, supported by the Multi Window UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multi Window, just like before, allows two apps to share one screen. You drag and drop the apps you want to open and then you can resize them by dragging the dedicated virtual separator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike before, now you can open even more apps by dragging them to the screen - the new app appears in a new floating window that you can move, minimize to an icon or expand to fullscreen. So, you can open all available apps in Multi Window, and they will stack up one over another (although we wouldn't advise you to do that for performance-related reasons. Then just pop up the Multi View bar, tap on the shortcut of the open app and it will be brought back to the front. Oh, and you can open multiple instances of the same app as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But wait, there is more. If you tap on an app's icon in the Multi Windows UI instead of drag-and-dropping it to the screen, you would get a floating app window instead! This works just like the Sony's Small Apps feature. You can minimize such an app to just a floating icon, go full screen or just close it. You can open as many floating apps as you like, though you can have only a single app instance running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can configure various content from My Files, Videos, or even email attachments to open straight in new windows under the multi-window feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Multi Window supports combinations - you can assign a shortcut that opens any two apps of you choice side-by-side with just one tap. Nice!</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Voice and Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 tablet features a couple of virtual assistants - Google's Now and Samsung's S Voice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows those scores of the sports teams you follow, gives you the weather forecast for your city and can even tell you who Kevin Spacey is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice can be used to dictate text, play music, open an app, change a setting, make a memo (including voice memo), add a reminder, schedule an event, set an alarm or timer, check the weather, do a search on the internet, look for local listings (e.g. nearby restaurants) and even get an answer to a question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Voice does duplicate parts of Google Now, but being less search focused it tries to do more on the actual tablet and it has some added features. Some of these are available outside of S Voice too, so you can set the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 to snooze an alarm, take a photo and what not by voice commands even when S Voice isn't running. The only problem with S Voice is that it's not nearly as fast or as accurate at recognizing your speech input as Google Now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the rest of the Pro series, the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is powered the Snapdragon 800 chipset whatever the edition - Wi-Fi-only, 3G or LTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 800 platform means you will be getting four Krait 400 cores at 2.3GHz and Adreno 330 graphics. The RAM you'll have at your disposal is 2GB - it should be enough for almost everything you throw at the slate. Still, a Galaxy Note 3-matching 3GB of RAM would probably have been more appropriate for such a powerhouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Until we see the new generation of Krait 450 and Cortex A5x cores arrives, the Krait 400 processor remains the most powerful on the market in terms of both per-core and total power. BenchmarkPi, Linpack and GeekBench 3 scores prove the Krait 400 dominance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 comes with a display resolution higher than 1080p and while it didn't show on AnTuTu 4 test, it surely did affected its Quadrant score.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, how well can the Adreno 330 GPU handle the 1600x2560 pixel screen? Let's find out. First we ran the familiar GFX Benchmark's offscreen tests, which are about raw power and not real-life performance. Naturally the Adreno 330 did great and occupied the top of the charts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBench 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more important benchmarks for the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 are those running onscreen, since they will show the slate's real-life performance. Quite expectedly, because of the higher resolution screen, it delivered a lower frame rate than S800-powered 1080p flagships on the demanding T-Rex and Manhattan graphic tests. Its performance noticeably fell on the Epic Citadel as well. The Adreno 330 will still manage playable framerates on the majority of the games in the Play Store, but we suspect there will be few hiccups on the heaviest titles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBench 2.7 T-Rex (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel (Ultra quality)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we put the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 through the SunSpider and BrowserMark benchmarks to test its JavaScript and overall browsing performance. The higher resolution wasn't of a burden here and it did as great as all other S800 devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is obvious the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is a powerhouse, but even the mighty Adreno 330 sometimes struggles when faced with so many pixels. The day to day performance will be as great as you could hope for, but some gamers might be less than perfectly happy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something we noticed - the 2GB RAM will fill up rather quickly once you start using Multi Window extensively and may run out. Samsung did great optimizing the feature and we've never experienced actual freezing or an app crash, but we saw the RAM bar full quite a few times. Reducing the number Magazine widgets helps freeing more RAM, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Tab Pro 8.4 is a snappy device and will deliver great performance. The Snapdragon 800 chipset powering the slate is put under more pressure than on the 1080p flagship, but it still passed the test with flying colors.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 comes in Wi-Fi-only and LTE flavors. The latter is capable of voice telephony and will come with a pre-installed Phone app. The Wi-Fi model that we got for reviewing only has the Contacts app, which serves the other methods of communicating - IM and email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the Contacts app syncs automatically with Google and your social networks, while you can choose which contacts to display. You can do everything a phone book should be capable of - edit a contact, import/export, join contacts, send or print name cards, get friends via social services, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two email clients we are used to see on Samsung devices are onboard - the Gmail app provided by Google and the Email client courtesy of Samsung. Both have a split-screen interface, support multiple accounts, bulk actions and folder view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Samsung Email app supports POP3, IMAP and Microsoft Exchange. It also offers a very useful Magazine widget, which will probably see lots of use if you are into email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There aren't any chat clients pre-installed on the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4, but you can always download Google's Hangouts or Samsung's ChatOn from the app repositories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung QWERTY keyboard occupies about half of the screen in landscape and about a third of screen in portrait view. There are two additional keyboard layouts to try out. You can opt for the small floating keyboard and a split keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Choosing the split keyboard allows you to quickly thumb-type while holding the tablet with both hands. It also leaves much more room for text, especially in the email client where the compose interface is in a popup that fits right between the two halves of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several other options are available to make text input easier, including various options for predictive text and auto correction. Swipe input is also supported or if you disable it, you can swipe left and right across the keyboard to move the cursor. The large keyboard does have arrow keys though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Powerful file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The My Files organizes your files into categories - Images, Videos, Music, Documents, Downloaded apps, Recent files and even Dropbox files. Those categories are always visible on the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split between folders and their content (with a complete tree view, similar to Windows Explorer).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive). More advanced functions include handling ZIP files and connecting to FTP servers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 offers various sorting and viewing options. Pinch zooming in or out will increase or reduce the size of the thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Album view shows a stack of photos with a navigational bar on the left with all the albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports bulk actions, photo notes, there are lots of sharing options as well, plus there is a powerful embedded image editor you can launch when viewing a single image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another cool feature is Buddy photo share - it recognizes faces in a photo, you link those to your contacts and the tablet will learn to recognize them itself in the future and tag them automatically. Then the faces in the photo become handy shortcuts to that contact. This way you can quickly send that photo you took of your friend just by touching their face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Brand new music player, still offers a plethora of features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 brings a completely redesigned TouchWiz music player. It offers the same rich functionality as the previous version, but introduces a much better interface. Naturally, the player supports a variety of file formats, including the FLAC format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Music app relies on a customizable tabbed interface, instead of the previous split-screen UI. Playlists are supported as well. The bottom of the screen, just like before, has the music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen, even though it's got a new skin, gives you the usual options - a timeline scrubber for the track, playback controls, and an AllShare shortcut. A coverflow-like list of album art lets you know what the next song will be and is an easy way to skip to it. The music player will also try to find the lyrics for the song you're listening to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has implemented several audio-enhancement features. The equalizer presets (called SoundAlive) are cleverly organized into a square similar to the Music Square. The presets balance between Treble and Bass, Vocals and Instrumental. You can also just tap the Auto toggle or enable a Tube amp effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advanced view of the equalizer gives you a proper seven band equalizer you can tune manually and enable additional effects like 3D, Bass and Clarity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio features don't end here. Smart sound will keep the sound level between tracks, while Adapt sound tests the performance of your headphones and tunes the equalizer based on that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No DivX and AC3 codecs for the video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player found on the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is pretty much the same we found on the Galaxy Note 3, Note 3 Neo and Note 10.1 2014.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the video codec support is quite subpar. Most videos we tried resulted in an "audio codec not supported" message and even some basic video codecs don't work (i.e. DivX). MKV, AVI (XviD) and MP4 videos do play, but anything beyond MP3 or AAC sound is no-go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player has three tabs - Personal, Downloads and Nearby devices - complete with a search field. The available videos show up as a grid of animated thumbnails, but list and folder view are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting feature of the video player is the ability to have a video running in a pop-up, which is visible throughout the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology from the music player is available here too. There are additional settings for the brightness, playback speed and feeding the audio through Bluetooth (if you have wireless speakers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If subtitles are available, the video player will automatically find and load them. You can also manually load subtitles, if the video and subtitle file names don't match. You can change the zoom mode (100% or fit to screen with and without affecting the videos aspect ratio) and there's a pinch zoom too, in case you want to get close to a specific part of the action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chapter preview detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above). Hovering your finger over the timeline scrubber lets you preview part of the video in a small thumbnail - just like YouTube videos do when you hover the mouse of your computer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 did excellently in our audio quality test. When docked to an active external amplifier, it produced stellar audio, scoring greatly in every part of the test. Its volume levels were just above average, but that's enough for an excellent overall mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones is a slight spike in stereo crosstalk. It's nothing to worry about though and it's way better than most competitors have it. A gifted performance by the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 on this occasion.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While our Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 doesn't have telephony features, we still tested the loudspeaker performance as it will be used for music and videos. It scored a Very Good score and we can confirm the stereo speakers are indeed quite loud.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Very good 8MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 features an 8 megapixel main camera and a 2 megapixel front-facing camera and you can shoot 1080p videos with both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is based on the new generation Samsung camera UI. A single viewfinder handles both still and video capture, so you don't have to switch modes. However, this is certainly not the most convenient solution as, if you're shooting full resolution 8MP photos, you'll have to frame your videos using a 4:3 ratio viewfinder, which doesn't match the screen's wider aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a wide variety of settings but they are spread out in different places. For starters, color effects (with a live preview for each) are at the bottom of the screen. You can download more effects from Samsung Apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another place with cool options is the Mode button, which brings out a carousel of advanced features (you can switch to grid view, but we find the carousel easier to use with the thumb). The features include major shooting modes such as HDR (called Rich tone) and Panorama, along with proprietary Samsung features such as Eraser (removes objects), Drama (duplicates objects), Sound &amp; shot (capture ambient sound to go with the photo), Best photo, Best Face and Beauty Face. Dual shot is also available - it combines the feed from both the front and back cameras on a single photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are even more options, some of which are visible in the top left corner. For the rest, you'll have to go into the full settings menu. These include burst shot, face detection, manual ISO setting, Smart stabilization and so on. Voice controls are enabled if you want to take a shot hands-free (e.g. a group shot).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 camera produces high-quality photos for the segment - the amount of detail is high, the noise is low and the photos have good color rendering. There are some issues, like the noticeable oversharpening halos, but those are minor overall.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 HDR mode does an excellent job of adding more detail in the highlights and keeping the real-life look of the photos without going overboard with the effect.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 has an 8MP camera and its performance is pretty much on par with some of the best 8MP cameraphones out there - kudos to Samsung for not skimping on this aspect of the tablet .</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p @ 30 fps videos with plenty of detail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 shoots 1080p videos at 30 fps. It is strange it can't capture 2160p videos (unlike the Galaxy Note 3), given that it is powered by the almighty Snapdragon 800 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 stores videos in MP4 files with 17Mbps bitrate on average. Stereo audio is recorded at 128Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate. Those are the same basic numbers as the videos taken by the Samsung Galaxy S4 for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video camera doesn't have many fancy shooting modes like the still camera, but dual shot is available and you can do time lapse videos. The time lapse videos can speed things up to 8x, with resolution and frame rate remaining at 1080p @ 30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available before and during video recording and you can switch back to continuous autofocus if you prefer. You can capture 6MP (16:9) photos during recording as well, their image quality seems quite decent too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos captured with the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 have a good amount of resolved detail, steady framerate and little noise. Colors and white balance are similar to those in still images. It can certainly give many cameraphones a run for their money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a 1080p video sample from the slate that we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can also check out the untouched 1080p@30fps sample that we captured with the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity lacks NFC and FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro comes in two flavors - Wi-Fi only and LTE. The LTE model features quad-band GSM and 3G support with HSPDA up to 42Mbps. The LTE support covers six bands and is category 4, which means you get up to 150Mbps downlink and up to 50Mbps uplink speeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both tablet versions feature Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac support, with 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA support are also available as well as GPS and GLONASS receivers. Bluetooth 4.0 is also available for local data transfer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microSD card slot as well, on top of the 16/32GB of internal storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 also supports USB-on-the-go, but you will need to buy an additional adapter for that. The tablet can work with USB storage, USB mice and keyboards. Of course, you can always hook up a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard to the slate without relying on the cable connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also buy a MHL HDMI adapter and use that to connect the tablet to your HDTV using a regular HDMI cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An IR blaster on the right of the tablet allows it to control TV's and other devices using the Samsung WatchON app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last piece of the connectivity puzzle, NFC, is missing as it was on the Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 edition). We didn't expect to find FM radio, because the Snapdragon 800 chipset does not support such by design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung AllShare feature is integrated with the Samsung's default apps - the Video Player app, the Gallery, and the Music Player - and it allows you wirelessly stream all sorts of multimedia content to your connected stereo or HDTV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to AllShare you can also mirror your mobile device screen to the bigger HDTV via Wi-Fi Direct and the widely supported Miracast protocol - that would even allow you to play mobile games on the biggest screen in your living room. You don't need to have a Samsung TV for that to work, but it needs to have Wi-Fi connectivity and support Miracast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Link (previously known as AllShare Play) is another proprietary service offered by Samsung. Once you download the dedicated app, it automatically syncs all the multimedia content on your device to Samsung servers so it's backed up and also available for instant watching/listening on your other Samsung devices (and even your Samsung SmartTV).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browsing experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 comes with both the stock Android browser (customized by Samsung) and Google's Chrome. Both support Multi-window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the interfaces of both browsers are virtually identical. Tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser, and the address bar and search bar are incorporated in a single field (with a voice input shortcut).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both browsers feature incognito tabs and request desktop view. Chrome has a Google-powered feature that sync open tabs between devices that run Chrome, but Samsung has integrated a similar feature into the stock browser (this one goes through your Samsung account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new tab for each browser is centered around thumbnails of the sites you visit most often. Bookmarks are also viewed as thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is no longer welcome as even the stock browser has dropped support for it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android calendar has been replaced with S Planner (as usual). It offers great and user friendly interface and does an excellent job of keeping your events organized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder. Multiple online calendars are supported and they can be color-coded for easier recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Wi-Fi only and LTE versions of the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 come with a GPS receiver. A-GPS can speed this up quite a bit, but requires Internet access. Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning is another quick (but less accurate) option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 comes with Google Maps and Google Maps Navigation. Google's voice-guided navigation app has become a viable solution already. Not that there are easy ways to attach a 8.4" tablet to your car's interior but it's doable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even if you don't intend to do that, the tablet is still great for reviewing routes you can later navigate with your phone. Also, the public transit option and street view can be very useful when on the go.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Premium apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung has positioned the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 as the premium tablet and as such it comes with a rich app package that most other tablets don't get (even other Galaxy Pro tablets). These are mostly centered around doing work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual suspects - Flipboard, Dropbox (with 50GB for two years bonus), Evernote and TripAdvisor - are on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More interesting are the Office apps from Hancom Office - Hword, Hcell and Hshow. They feature interfaces similar to the desktop Microsoft Office apps, meaning they are busy with tons of buttons. While they can be operated with a finger, we get the feeling it would be more comfortable to use a mouse with those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's hard to use those apps without an external keyboard too - the large QWERTY just takes up too much space (from what little was left with such a complicated app UI). It's a good thing you can switch to one of the less intrusive on-screen keyboards in a pinch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't think that we're knocking these apps - they really do feel like a desktop Office package and we think this is intentional. For one, it would make people who are not tech savvy feel right at home and also they are packed to the rafters with features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is followed up by two collaboration apps - Cisco WebEx and Samsung e-Meeting. The first handles conferencing (and even sharing what's on your screen), while the second handles sharing content peer-to-peer without the need for an intermediate server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more - if you're going to connect a keyboard and mouse to the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4, you can just as well launch the Remote PC app, which does just what it says on the tin. It gives you remote access to your home or office PC, which works rather well on the tablet's high-resolution screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The premium app package doesn't end here, Samsung is promising up to $700 of value in content downloads. A lot of that is for subscriptions - you get a one year subscription to BusinessWeek+, 12-week one to NY Times, a 6-month one to Livesport.tv, a 3-month one for LinkedIn premium, plus a free Oxford's Advanced Learners Dictionary. Those are all available for download over at Samsung Apps repository for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other apps are included as well, like Bitcasa, which offers a lot more storage than Dropbox - a whopping 1TB - but the subscription is for three months only. Note that the RemotePC service is also subscription based (you get 2 years) and so are Evernote (3-12 month subscription, market dependent) and LinkedIn (3 months Premium Membership).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>App repositories<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google's Play Store is one of the biggest mobile app stores and offers amazing amount of applications, so whatever you need, you'll find it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it. Google has added a small "designed for phones" warning for apps that don't have tablet interfaces. Those can look bad on the large screen, so it's nice to be warned beforehand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has naturally included its own Apps store. It features largely the same type of interface as Google Play, except here you'll find a far lower number of apps. The good news is Samsung uses this repository to distribute some exclusive titles and some promotional offers, available only to its customers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's really easy to recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 (outside the part where you actually have to pronounce its name). This slate easily has the best screen, the top-performing hardware, the best software package, and, if you must ask, the best camera in its class. If you want a mid-sized tablet for both multimedia and work, Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is certainly one of the best choices out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has finally put some extensive work on the user interface and the new Magazine homescreens and widgets are spot on. We feel those should have come a few generations earlier to utilize the full potential of the previously underdeveloped homescreen panes. Condensing so much information on so little space in a meaningful way is a great feat and we have no doubt this approach might shape the industry in the near future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has also ditched the old and ugly design of the notification area for a much better looking and user friendly one. There is a new music player too, plus Samsung gives you an excellent mobile office - arguably the best we've seen to date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is a milestone in the Android tablet usability and it's a benchmark other should live up to. Slim, powerful, beautiful and jam packed with features - it really doesn't get much better than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The obvious downside is that the thing doesn't come cheap. Along with the Retina-packing iPad mini, this is the costliest mid-sized tablet, but you can easily see Samsung's point with this one. It all boils down to what you really need - an oversized smartphone of a tablet or a powerful multi-tasker like the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is offering the Tab Pro in three different sizes - 8.4, 10.1 and 12.2 inches. They all share absolutely identical specs, save for the screen and battery capacities. There is even a Note Pro 12.2 in case you fancy the S-Pen features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 LTE &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 LTE &#x2022; Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 LTE</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you are reading this review, you probably have already set your mind for the smallest member of the family. What now remains to be see is if the 8.4-inch Galaxy Tab will be able to handle the Apple iPad mini 2 with Retina display. Even though both devices share the same form factor, they offer completely different user experiences and target somewhat different user groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad mini 2 is great for games and relies heavily on the Apple eco-system and it wealth of tablet-optimized apps. It certainly has the upper hand with the superior choice of both productivity and time-killer apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 is better tailored to the people who would use their tablet do some work and who would appreciate the unparalleled multi-tasking and the flexibility that comes with an open file system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you fall into that second group of people and you haven't already invested a lot of money into iOS apps, it's certainly worth considering the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4. There is one other reason to pick the Galaxy Tab 8.4 - while the base price of the two slates is about the same, the Samsung tablet comes with a microSD card slot for cheaper expansion. The 32GB version of Retina iPad mini, which we find way useful will cost you an extra &#x20ac;100.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad mini 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG G Pad 8.3, is an excellent alternative to those looking to fit within a more reasonable budget and don't mind settling for slightly less processing power to achive it. The G Pad is offers great design with a metal back, a Full HD IPS display and a still capable Snapdragon 600 chipset . So picking between those two is as easy as deciding on your budget really - spend a sensible amount and get a good tablet or go all in and get the very best of the droid land.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G Pad 8.3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 ticks all the right checkboxes to be a great tablet. It has a top-notch screen, a super fast chipset and plenty of exclusive software tricks to survive in the increasingly crowded market. More impressively, it has no major gaps in its armory, just like you'd expect from a flagship device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, it's expensive, but until its impressive user experience is matched by a cheaper slate we can't really call it overpriced. It's a gadget to be looking up to and a companion, whose presence will be enjoyed by everyone.</paragraph>
