			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones for the masses is what Samsung want and Bada alone won't be enough perhaps to get them there. Why not the Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 then? A mid-range Android phone with a custom paintjob on the OS and few nice software surprises - doesn't sound bad at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android is infiltrating the lower smartphone ranks. Mission objective: cut down on expensive hardware features and provide a robust experience. The Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 does just that. The hardware won't make it a flagship, but with 3G, Wi-Fi, GPS, Android OS (slightly modified and even improved) and a 1500mAh battery it sounds like a reliable phone that can do the job for most people.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 has no flagship aspirations and it doesn't need to look like a million bucks. The minimalist design means it's not too extravagant, but it's not boring either. High-end, cutting edge phones are reputation builders, but it's usually the mid and low end handsets that end up in most people's pockets. Pocket is the keyword and the Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 seems well aware of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>About the software surprises we mentioned - one of them is Swype, a novel way to type on a virtual QWERTY keyboard, and the other is the excellent DivX/XviD support. Not that it's a surprise coming from Samsung, but certainly a great feature to have. And it's rare enough on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the next page, we take the Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 for a spin and check the newborn droid in and out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Disclaimer: This preview is based on an early Samsung I5800 Galaxy 3 prototype. Changes in the final retail product are highly probable. We'll update this article when we get a more final version of both the hardware and software.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I5800 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Designwise, the Samsung I5800 looks quite close to the Samsung S5560 Marvel but it?s actually just a bit bigger. In fact, the gem-shaped center key and the touch-sensitive soft keys that are hidden most of the time making it look like just any one of the countless Samsung touchscreen bars. Not much of a looker this one, but makes sense as a midrange phone. The I5800 measures 113.5 x 55 x 12.9 mm and weighs 109.7 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset avoids right angles and is curved all around. The I5800 has a strong emphasis on simplicity ? the only things that stand out on the neat and simple front are the thin silver rim of the D-Pad and the grill of the earpiece.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of the Samsung I5800 is not revolutionary, but the touchscreen bar is very limiting in what manufacturers can do. Samsung have given us another neat and simple, all-plastic device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design is utterly minimalistic and hides away most of the functional elements. The Android keys (menu, home, back and search) are touch sensitive and are only visible when their backlight is on. The D-pad looks like a simple center key, even the volume rocker is not very prominent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is a 3.2? touchscreen of WQVGA resolution. It?s the first Android smartphone we see that has this particular resolution. It uses capacitive technology to sense even very light taps. The image quality is good as far as TFT screens go, with good brightness and decent contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is pretty bad however ? there?re too much reflections and the display often ends up reflecting sunlight right into your eyes, obscuring everything on screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the D-pad and the standard arrangement of Android keys. The D-pad has the appearance of a simple center key, but can be used to scroll both vertically and sideways. You probably won?t use it much, the only time it?s actually better than just using the touchscreen is when you need to go back a couple of letters and fix a typo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other four keys ? Menu and Home keys on the left; Back and Search on the right ? are touch sensitive. When their backlighting is off, they become invisible and blend with the black plastic of the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are capacitive, which means they react only to bare fingers. They don?t provide any haptic feedback at this point, but that?s about to be fixed we guess. There?s a setting for it in the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display there?s the earpiece on top and the Samsung logo below it. To the left there are a couple of sensors that didn?t work on our unit, but we guess they are an ambient light sensor and a proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the phone you get the volume rocker and a lanyard eyelet. The right is completely bare, not even a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top does not surprise at all nor does it disappoint - it houses a 3.5 mm audio jack, a standard microUSB port with a protective cover and the power key, which also serves as a lock/hold key. The phone charges off the microUSB port - just like most of its recent siblings. The bottom is not very interesting - only the mouthpiece is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the 3.2-megapixel camera lens is on the back, along with the Samsung logo and a ?with Google? label. The camera is inset, which is the only protection against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset?s rear is curved in - the top and bottom slightly raised - which is another way of making sure the camera lens won?t touch the surface the phone rests on. The speaker is very close to the edge of the ?bump? at the bottom but doesn?t get muffled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover you'll find a 1500 mAh battery and the SIM and microSD card slots. Typically for the latest Samsung devices the memory slot is under the back cover and even though it's hot-swappable, you still need to open the cover first. The slot is on the left side of the device and the SIM card compartment is on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5800 sits well in the hand and you can comfortably reach everything, but it isn?t a small phone. The I5800 is generally pocketable, but not the most compact of handsets. It?s glossy black plastic all-around so be prepared to regularly deal with fingerprints. All in all, there?s nothing much to get excited about in the I5800 hardware. It?s a midrange package all right, but it just seems too plain for an Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But hey, here?s a little spoiler. We get the feeling the I5800 is more than likely to redeem itself in the software department.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface ? best of both worlds<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Putting a custom skin on the OS is what manufacturers have always been keen to do. They would tailor the user interface to their own understanding of usability. The bottom line though, is making it unique and recognizable, to set it apart from competing devices using the same software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5800 is no different ? the interface has been tweaked to look very much like Samsung?s pride and joy, the Bada OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like on the Samsung Galaxy S, on the I5800 Samsung have managed to blend their interface with the native UI, rather than just slap one on top of the other. Given the inherent similarities between Bada and Android, the I5800 UI is very smooth and consistent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>People who have used TouchWiz before (few have yet got a chance on its successor, Bada) won?t take long to feel at home. The good news though is the same holds true for Android users. Samsung have changed the vanilla Android enough to make it their own, but all the strengths of the Android interface are intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four buttons at the bottom of the homescreen that provide shortcuts to the main functions of the phone ? dialer, contacts, messaging and applications. There are 7 homescreen panes instead of the five in Android 2.1, and the current position is indicated by numbered dots top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has also been tweaked ? it now has four toggles to mute sound and turn Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS on and off. These are accessible from pretty much anywhere, so if the app requests, say, your location or wants to download lots of data, you can switch on GPS or Wi-Fi in a couple of clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen makes heavy use of widgets ? they are not just cute little apps that show the weather or tell you to quit smoking. Some custom Samsung widgets have enough functionality to be apps in their own right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, the Feeds &amp; updates widget streamlines the updates from Facebook, MySpace and Twitter into a single feed and lets you post updates to these sites straight from the widget itself. You get full-blown apps for Facebook and MySpace for the more complex tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Daily Briefing widget is an exact copy of the eponymous application in Bada OS and being on the homescreen feels much more natural for what it provides ? a one-stop summary of the weather, stock quotes, news and upcoming appointments in the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also the StockClock, which combines the clock with a stock quote ticker, and the Days widget, which works with the Mini Diary app ? it?s similar to HTC?s Footsteps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you can customize the homescreen into either a handy business tool or a social networking hub. With seven homescreens at hand, you can easily have both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting addition in the folders section is the Facebook phonebook folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock screen imitates the Samsung S8500 Wave and Galaxy S ? there?s a translucent glass that you have to slide away to unlock the phone. There?s also a smart unlock function which - unlike the standard Android version - doesn?t use a grid of dots but lets you scrawl a random shape pattern. However it didn?t seem complete, we couldn?t even change the lock pattern. We?ll have to wait for the final version to find out if it can launch apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Text input, Android meets Swype<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text input is not usually a particularly exciting part of a preview but the Samsung I5800 is different. Just like Samsung Galaxy S, it features a Swype-enhanced on-screen QWERTY keyboard in both portrait and landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The way Swype works is instead of tapping on keys you sweep a finger across the keyboard. To ?type? quick, you need to put a finger on the Q key and sweep over to U, then I, then C and all the way to K. There?s a visual trail that marks your finger movement across the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t matter if the trace goes over other keys, in fact you can?t help it. But Swype recognizes the word you intended to enter with surprising accuracy ? it correctly guessed ?xylophone? without breaking a sweat. The high precision means that even fast sweeps will be recognized correctly, so you can enter text very quickly and keep the error rate low at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With shorter words, there might be several combinations possible ? in that case Swype simply prompts you to pick which one you meant. If you accidentally picked the wrong word, you can double tap on it and pick again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You?d think that there would be hurdles ? like entering ?son? or ?soon? without Swype asking you which word you want every time. But there?s a way around that ? if you want to enter a double letter just draw a small circle on it and continue swiping (or ?swyping?) as usual. Drawing that small circle is a little hard to get used to though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swype is very unobtrusive - it presents the user with a regular-looking QWERTY keyboard, on which you can type by tapping the keys the old fashioned way. Swype is cool though once you get the hang of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Swype you?re likely to never hit space ? it?s automatically inserted before every new word you sweep to type. To switch to uppercase you sweep up from the keyboard into the text box. The only thing it doesn?t seem to do is automatically capitalize the fist letter following a fullstop. But that may as well be corrected in the final software version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swype has a pretty big dictionary built-in, but you can teach it new words too (just type them out the regular way and the word will be remembered for next time).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an excellent tutorial, which shows you step by step how to do everything with Swype ? capitalizing, punctuation and a few other tricks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We think that Swype is a great improvement over the regular virtual keyboard and we?d like to see it in more handsets. Most importantly though, it?s there if you like it ? if not, you don?t even have to turn it off or anything. Just type instead of sweep</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browser got a touch of make-up too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser has got some of the skinning treatment. The changes are cosmetic mostly and all the excellent functionality of the Eclair browser is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the different look of the address bar, there are five buttons at the bottom row ? back and forward, more, bookmarks and tabs. In full-screen mode those are hidden and the only thing to see is the full-screen mode toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Complex pages are rendered perfectly (which is typical for Android) and navigating them is a breeze. The browser offers three zoom methods ? double tap, pinch and Samsung?s one-finger zoom. Text reflow always keeps the columns of text as wide as the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser also offers bookmarks, a most visited section that displays pages as thumbnails, searching for text on page, a password manager and form auto-filling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big omission in the browser is Flash, but that?s hardly surprising.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera: no lights, but action!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera on the Samsung I5800 is modest by today?s standards ? 3.2 megapixel with autofocus and QVGA video at 15fps. There isn?t even a dedicated shutter key (but then again the Nexus One doesn?t either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have a lot of experience with cameraphones, so they?ve developed a really good touch camera interface. And they?ve ported it to the Samsung I5800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the standard modes like the Continuous shooting mode (which captures 9 photos at 3.2MP resolution) and the Panorama (automatically captures and stitches up to 8 photos at VGA resolution) there are a few new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one is Action Shot ? press the shutter and the Samsung I5800 will start tracking moving objects. When an object moves faster than some threshold the camera will automatically take the shot. There isn?t a way to change the threshold, but we?ll check again in the final version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Add Me is not particularly useful ? it splits the frame in half vertically and lets you take two different shots, which are put side by side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also offers several Scene presets, a macro mode, manual ISO selection (100, 200, 400), a number of effects, viewfinder gridlines and geo-tagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5800 we have is a pre-production unit so the camera software probably hasn?t been fine tuned yet. The photos end up a bit on the dark side and the JPEG compression is a little too high, but these things should be ironed out in the production unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera captures a decent amount of detail for a 3MP snapper, the noise seems to be kept in check, though the compression exaggerates it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sorry about the snowy camera samples. It's like we said, we've had an early prototype way back when we weren't allowed to publish anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder captures video in QVGA resolution at 15fps ? good for MMS only. It has basic image effects (negative, sepia and black and white) but that?s about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a sample video ? QVGA@15fps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia: music and video players, FM radio and Media Browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5800 boasts an impressive multimedia package ? in both audio and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s start with the Music player. It?s a custom job by Samsung and offers 5.1 channel emulation, DNSe with Music Clarity, Bass enhancement, Concert hall, externalization and a few other presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tilting the phone landscape brings up a Cover Flow-esque interface of a rotating set of CDs with album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Video player has a simplistic interface but it was a pleasant surprise when we tried playing DivX videos ? the player handled every DivX or XviD video we threw at it, including one of 720 x 400 pixel resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I5800 has an FM radio, which sometimes gets omitted on Android phones. It?s a good thing to have as a backup if you get bored with the music you have on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media Browser is the picture and video gallery. It does 3D animated transitions and it?s very simple to use. The best thing about it though is the ability to view photos from Facebook (both yours and your friends?) and MySpace too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apps galore<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are dedicated apps for Facebook and MySpace, though for simply updating your status you can use the Feeds &amp; Update widget. Unfortunately, the apps couldn?t log in, so we?ll have to wait for the review to test them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mini diary is similar to HTC?s Footsteps. You can add entries into it with dates, the weather (automatically pulled from AccuWeather) plus a photo and a short text. It?s great for a travel diary, though we would have liked it to have a way to post diary entries online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a preinstalled file browser (by default there isn?t one in Android) called My Files and looks and behaves much like the file browser on other Samsung phones. It can browse files on the microSD card (it can?t access the internal memory though) and manage files (move, copy, delete, etc.) and also send and receive files over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are other apps of interest. Write and go can post Facebook updates, send messages and create memos and calendar entries. There?s Quickoffice preinstalled, All Share (a DLNA client/server) and an Evernote app (a collaboration service for notes and more), image and video editors and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re not sure if all of these apps will make it to the final production version. If they do, the Samsung I5800 will have a very rich application package out of the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are quite a few impressive things about the Samsung I5800. For one, the re-skinned Android looks like Bada OS, but isn?t a half-baked mess. Instead, it promises comfort to both Android users and those coming from a Samsung handset with TouchWiz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swype too ? it?s a fresh take on touchscreen QWERTY and could easily become the way to touch-type in the future. It?s faster and more accurate than handwriting recognition, and once you get used to it, it?s certainly faster than tapping the keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Video Player that handled DVD quality DivX was impressive as well ? DivX/XviD players for Android are hard to come by. There are other things as well, like the balanced selection of widgets and apps for business and fun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware, unlike the top-notch software, is average. That?s not to say bad, but it?s not ahead of the competition either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, there you go. Android is a mature platform already and it brings excellent user experience ? especially with a few tasty add-ons like Swype and DivX video. The Samsung I5800 is one of the finer examples of what the OS can do in the midrange. With the right price tag this phone can really push on value for money.</paragraph>
