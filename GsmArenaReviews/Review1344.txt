		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Phones far and wide wanted to be the iPhone killer and you know what ? tablets are no different. The iPad needs to get used to living with a bounty on its head. And always be ready for the likes of the Motorola XOOM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the XOOM is no ordinary competitor. We?re talking the first Honeycomb tablet, a cornerstone for Android. It?s Motorola?s first tablet too. If they play their cards right, it could be a big money earner for a company in trouble, so we know Moto gave it their best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XOOM has a 10.1? screen of 1280 x 800 pixels resolution, Google?s latest Android OS (after the update rolls out in full), purpose made for tablet use, and a powerful Tegra 2 1GHz dual-core chipset with 1GB RAM. Barely a few lines into the spec sheet and we already like the sound of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola XOOM has more to offer than that. The Verizon US version will be getting a (delayed) LTE update, while dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz) sounds sweet too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we won?t go on and on about the specs of the XOOM. Here go the highlights followed ? as usual ? by what we didn?t like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re really curious to try out the tablet minded version of Android ? the one we?ve tested before was clunky to use and clearly not intended for big screens. And we?ve had a positive experience with the Tegra 2 platform. It?ll be interesting to see how it performs inside a tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And let?s just say that seeing a standard microHDMI port was a pleasant surprise ? no need of an adapter to get the TV-Out working. The competition doesn?t even have a standard microUSB port so thumbs up for Motorola and keeping to standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XOOM we?re about to get started with is the 3G-enabled variety with 32GB of inbuilt storage. And yes, it?s got Honeycomb inside ? the version of Android meant for tablets. We can hardly wait. Jump to the next page and try to keep up.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Motorola XOOM<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola XOOM comes in a spacious box but the contents are standard ? a charger (not much smaller than a laptop charger), a microUSB cable and a manual. If you?re hoping for a microHDMI cable, you?re out of luck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be fair, the iPad 2 box didn?t include anything extra either. Still, the charger is bigger than it needs to be, or at least bigger than we would have liked.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>High-res display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 10.1? screen of the Motorola XOOM has a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels, which means 149ppi pixel density. That?s slightly higher than the iPad and enough for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a plain TFT however, which suffers from color and contrast distortion when viewed at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The change in colors is small but visible, it?s the contrast that?s the bigger problem. Text remains readable but if you?re viewing photos you will want to look at the screen head on as the image quality suffers at even the slightest tilt.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this isn't where the problems of the Motorola XOOM display end. The coating of the screen is highly reflective and it often makes you look for a proper angle that doesn?t have reflection issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stepping outside in the sunlight makes things even worse. The stronger the ambient light, the more visible the reflection. You can easily gaze at the clouds by looking down at the XOOM ? even at full brightness the reflection is still too prominent for a good viewing experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fingerprints are also a problem ? the screen quickly becomes a mess (nothing out of the usual for tablets), and it?s not very easy to clean.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display brightness and contrast<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve already released our display brightness and contrast measurements in a blog post but we?ll recap them here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola XOOM turned out to be quite bright ? a tad brighter than both the iPad and the iPad 2 at full blast. 436 nits of brightness is hard to get even on much smaller mobile phone screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it was the contrast ratio that made our jaws drop ? 2041:1 at full brightness makes short work of any LCD display we?ve tested so far (AMOLEDs are in a different league). That includes Retina displays, Reality displays, NOVA displays ? all the big names on the market right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brilliant contrast ratio is tarnished by the reflectivity of the display ? unless you?re in a dark room, there?s always something reflecting off the screen making the perceived contrast ratio much lower.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a table that pits the Motorola XOOM against some of the other displays we?ve tested.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola XOOM sure looks attractive, mixing glass, metal and plastic for the finish. With its rounded corners, tapered edges and thin bezel around the screen, we dare say the XOOM is quite a looker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s very little in the way of hardware controls on the front of the Motorola XOOM. Actually, besides the screen, the front-facing camera and an ambient light sensor, there?s almost nothing else. Android Gingerbread moved the Back, Menu and Home buttons on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, there?s a 2MP front-facing camera and an ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To the right of the screen there?s a status LED and below the screen there?s a charging LED. We nearly missed them: for some reason the ones on our unit never lit up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Time for a tour of the hardware controls on the Motorola XOOM ? it won?t take long we promise. In fact, with Android Gingerbread replacing the standard controls (back, home, menu) with on-screen ones, there are only two controls left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is the volume control on the left. It consists of two separate buttons, which are small, thin and somewhat recessed ? and quite uncomfortable to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other control is the Power/Lock key on the back ? it sits flush against the surface to prevent accidental presses and is fairly easy to reach with your left hand when you?re holding the XOOM landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not as comfortable to reach when the tablet is held in portrait mode. It?s either in the top right corner or the bottom left one (depends on how you turn the XOOM) and depending on how you hold the tablet, you might cover it with your hand. Reaching the Power/Lock key after you?ve placed the XOOM down on the table is also a pain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back also features quite a few other things of interest ? on a single strip of contrasting color we have the 5MP autofocus camera, the dual-LED flash, one of the two speakers and the Power/Lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are arranged symmetrically making the whole layout quite attractive though it gives the lens virtually no protection against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The curve of the back is also not enough to completely protect the stereo speakers against getting muffled when placed on a level surface. On the upside, the two speakers are quite far apart improving the stereo sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Motorola XOOM is where the wired ports are: microUSB, microHDMI port, a docking connector and finally, the 2mm charger plug. None of these is covered with anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were a little disappointed to find out that a microUSB connection wouldn?t charge the XOOM ? you?ll have to use the old-fashioned 2mm charger port for the job. On the upside, the microUSB has host functionality ? rather will have ? once you update to Android 3.1. You will need a proper adapter though and those can be hard to find.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also at the bottom is the mic pinhole and two Torx T5 screws that hold the back cover ? we?ll get back to it in a moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let?s take a look at the top of the Motorola tablet first. There?s a 3.5mm audio jack dead center and a small tray to its left. The tray serves a two-fold purpose: you put your (regular-sized) SIM card in it and it?s the cover of the memory slot too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, technically, the Motorola XOOM will support 32GB cards. You read that right ? it will. We?re just waiting for a software update to enable it. Motorola even put a transparent dummy in the slot with the message (in tiny letters) ?Replace with microSD only after Android system update?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But don?t blame it on Android ? the OS has supported microSD cards since day one. You?d think that a tablet that has been on sale for about two months would have basic stuff like that working, but the more we play with the XOOM, the more we get the feeling that Motorola rushed it to the shelves before it was finished.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The matt metal cover on the back is top notch ? pleasant to the touch, great at hiding fingerprints and in combination with the black strip above it, it looks pretty nice too. Unfortunately, the battery hides underneath it. Not that it?s common for tablets to have user-replaceable batteries ? but still.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the 24Wh battery promises up to 10 hours of browsing over Wi-Fi or video playback, and nearly three and a half days of music playback. The standby time is quoted at 14 days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran our own browsing-over-Wi-Fi battery test and the Motorola XOOM lasted 7 hours and 50 minutes ? quite close to what they claim. You can check out our blog post for some more details on battery performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola XOOM is as big as tablets come ? in fact due to its 10.1? screen it?s slightly bigger than the iPad 2. The build quality is great with quality finish though the XOOM is quite heavy at 730 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One-handed use is tricky ? your hand gets tired pretty quickly, made worse by the smooth metal finish at the back. 730g of slippery tablet is easier to drop that any user would be comfortable with. As much as we like metal, it just doesn?t provide enough grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to an iPad 2, the XOOM is almost the same size. But when you hold both in the hand, the iPad 2 is noticeably lighter and quite a bit thinner.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Android goes tablet-friendly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>No matter how impressive the XOOM hardware might be, the software will decide its fate. It just can?t help it, being the first to carry Honeycomb, the tablet-friendly version of Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there?s a good reason why Honeycomb gets so much attention. Unlike Apple, who thought upscaling a phone OS to fit the size of tablets would be enough, Google designed a whole new interface for their slates. It?s of utter importance to put the extra screen estate to good use and get around the constraints that apply to smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>So they revamped the whole interface to make best use of all the available resolution and the entire screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing they did is remove all hardware buttons and replace them with software controls. Now, we are not hugely impressed with that move, but tablets don?t usually have too many buttons anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The home and back buttons have been placed in the lower left corner, adding a dedicated task switcher key right next to them. It?s probably in part a move to emphasize the Honeycomb love for multitasking too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The search key has been placed in the top left corner, while the app launcher is now accessed via a button at the top right. Next to it, there?s another dedicated button that the smartphone-friendly Android versions lack ? homescreen edit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we come upon the status icons, which are in the lower right corner. Pressing any of them will open the notification pop-up ? in Honeycomb the notification area doesn?t take the whole screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a shortcut to settings. That is more of a replacement for the connectivity switches that you find in some Android smartphones (such as the Samsung TouchWiz droids), than the real settings menu, which is accessible through the home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen has also been modified to make better use of the larger screen. When you enter edit mode you get all five homescreen panes on top with four tabs available at the bottom - widgets, apps, wallpapers and ?more?.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This way you can grab a widget from the bottom tab and bring it to the desired homescreen pane on top. With smartphones you need to scroll screens if you want to place a widget on any other screen but the currently selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, live wallpapers are supported here too but many of them seemed unsuited to the higher resolution and pixelated. Plus, they did tend to lag quite a lot, which we cannot quite explain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher has seen some changes too ? it?s now split in two tabs ? All and My apps. The first one contains all the available apps, while the second one holds those installed by you. A press and hold on any of them will make the five homescreen panes appear so you can place a shortcut on whichever you might need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, we are pretty pleased with the usability of the Honeycomb interface. It is obvious that a lot of thought went into its design and it really is a notch above the competition in terms of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However there?s a big issue holding Honeycomb tablets back that needs to be resolved ? the performance. The XOOM lagged often ? even with a static wallpaper and no user-installed apps to run in background. For some reason, the problems were particularly apparent in portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola tablet really felt like an early test unit (and it?s not) that still needed its software tweaked to make best use of the hardware. After all, a dual-core chipset like Tegra 2 shouldn?t have had any trouble, never mind the higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus the thing is getting some excellent benchmarks so no doubt the processing power is all there. We really believe Honeycomb is a few software tweaks away from becoming the best tablet OS out there. Unfortunately we couldn?t get our XOOM updated to 3.1 and see if that helps, but at this stage the handling is poor. With the performance so bad all those features make little sense really.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Contacts<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is fairly straightforward on the Motorola XOOM. Your contacts get automatically synced with your Google account unless you explicitly disable this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The larger screen has allowed some modifications that reduce the needed clicks for some tasks and thus improve usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You now get your contacts listed by either first or last name in the left part of the screen, while the details of the currently selected contact appear on the right. There is a handy search field on top as well as a shortcut for adding a new contact or editing the selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the XOOM has no telephony clicking a phone number does nothing, but tapping an email address or a website automatically launches the email app or the web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a single contact is not the best-looking part of the contact management on the XOOM, but at least it?s easy to use. You get the available fields organized in groups, with plus and minus signs on the right that let you remove or duplicate details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also an Add another field button at the bottom that lets you insert a filed that hasn?t existed so far for the specific contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Custom filed names aren?t available at this stage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the XOOM results from our traditional loudspeaker test. The device did pretty well getting a very good Mark. You can find more about the test itself here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Emailing on the go is one of the things that make people buy tablets in the first place. The XOOM does pretty well here, coming with two optimized email applications out of the box ? one for your Gmail and one that you can use with any POP3/IMAP account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They both have split-screen interface, much like the contacts app. Initially your folders are listed on the left and the emails in the currently selected one appear on the right. Upon clicking on a single email the list of emails moves to the left tab while the body of the selected one pops up on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bulk actions are supported too, so you will easily manage mailboxes that get tons of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can setup the automatic check for email interval or you can disable that completely and retrieve mail manually. There?s also a handy setting that makes your client automatically download attachments only when you are connected over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s basically the treatment you get on Android smartphones with a few optimizations permitted by the large screen and higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Writing emails is reasonably comfortable with the virtual QWERTY keyboard occupying about half of the 10.1? screen. Now this is no match for a hardware keyboard, but you won?t notice any big difference when handling short emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s auto correction and auto capitalization available and you can enable sounds on keypresses. There?s no haptic feedback this time so it?s not perfect just yet, but the overall experience is pretty decent.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola XOOM gallery is a pretty standard Android affair in terms of functionality but it has too been tweaked to be more comfortable on the large screen. Naturally, your Picasa web albums are automatically synced with your tablet but by default they can only be browsed if you have an active internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sort your images by album, date, location or tag. You can also choose between displaying images, videos or both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper right corner holds shortcuts to the camera, image details preview or extra settings (like make available offline for Picasa albums).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you are browsing a specific album/date/location/tag the shortcuts change a bit ? the extra settings shortcut is replaced by a button that starts a slide show. The icon in the very top left corner becomes active and clicking it brings you back to the full gallery view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the XOOM gallery has the same issue as most of its smartphone siblings ? it doesn?t show you full size images, but downsized versions instead. This means that you cannot see all the detail on a photo on the tablet itself, which is a pity, given the excellent picture browsing potential.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To end the gallery overview on a positive note we?ll mention a cool accelerometer-based trick. In the default view, albums with more than one photo inside have a cool 3D shadow effect when you tilt the slate.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A looker of a music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XOOM music player comes with a cool looking interface that lets you sort your tracks by album, artist, song, genre, playlist or just bring the new and recent additions on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, there?s also a search option, which will be greatly appreciated by those with large music collections. It gets activated by pressing the magnifying glass icon in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a specific album (or a group of tracks based on any filter) you get the familiar split screen interface. Album art, which is naturally supported, appears on the left along with the information about the compilation. The track list goes on the right and the currently playing track (if any) appears at the bottom with quick controls available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing screen offers shuffle and repeat (including repeat one) functionality, but no equalizers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if there is a track playing in background a dedicated row appears in the notification area showing its name. There are also quick pause or skip controls right there so you don?t need to open the music player every time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player really should have done better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite the large screen and enviable processing power, the Motorla XOOM doesn?t make for much of a portable video player. And you can tell that right from the start as the thing doesn?t even have a dedicated video player app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will have to switch the gallery to video only mode every time or you will have to sift through all your images to find a specific video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The codec support is also seemingly a few years old with DivX and Xvid nowhere in sight. You will have to either get a third-party app for playing those, which will inevitably harm performance or convert all your videos before uploading them to the XOOM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And with no mass-storage mode available, uploading is a bit more complicated than necessary too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this, topped with a screen which you can hardly see outside, make up for a rather mediocre overall experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Great audio output... if you reduce the volume<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Given that we're dealing with a tablet with plenty of space for audio hardware, and that even Motorola smartphones have been pretty impressive recently, we didn't expect anything, but a flawless performance from the XOOM in our audio quality test. The slate delivered, but you should keep in mind that Motorola pulled a similar stunt to what they did with the Atrix - the volume levels can be pushed beyond what the device can actually handle. So if you set the XOOM to maximum volume you might be slightly disappointed with the quality of its sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you punch in the volume level all the way up you get really loud output but the dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio and stereo crosstalk all suffer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's why you would be better off lowering the volume a couple of steps down - you will be enjoying some impressively clean output, certainly comparable to the best we have seen. In that scenario the XOOM won't be as loud as you might expect a tablet to be, but just look at those numbers below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even headphones don't take away too much from that. Even after the expected increase in stereo crosstalk, things are still looking pretty good when you plug in the headphones. You might not like however, the rise in intermodulation distortion and the slight hit that frequency response takes in the extreme low frequencies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola XOOM frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-geared connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola XOOM is one of best-featured tablets in terms of connectivity. Or at least one of the slates with the most potential as many of the options here still need a software update to become usable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a standard microUSB interface complete with USB host functionality. Unfortunately, you won?t be able to use it before the expected Android 3.1 Honeycomb update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola chose not to enable charging through USB either, so you will need to keep the proprietary charger at hand at all times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you get Wi-Fi and GPS radios and if you shelled out the extra cash for the 3G version, you will be able to experience 10.2 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Verizon version is LTE enabled, but that too is to be unlocked with a software update at a later time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that needs an update to actually use is the microSD card slot. Right now the XOOM as it will simply fail to recognize your card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that when the update eventually rolls out, you will be able to get a large capacity memory card for much less than the premium needed to upgrade from the 16GB version to 32GB or 64GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity options worth mentioning are Bluetooth (with file transfer support) and the microHDMI port that allows high definition TV-out without an adapter. Chances are you will still need to get a new cable, but that?s usually the far cheaper option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser does a solid job, but Flash performance fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser is another key app as far as tablets are concerned. With a relatively good-looking interface and full Flash support, the XOOM sets off to a pretty good start taking an edge over the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are kept in a bar on top, much like on a desktop browser and opening a new one is as easy as clicking the plus sign on the right. The address bar and search bar are, as usual for Android devices incorporated in a single field, which scores another point for the XOOM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bookmarks have their own screen and history uses a split-screen interface letting you check the pages browsed today, yesterday or over the past week. There?s also a most visited tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronizing the browser with your desktop Google Chrome doesn?t need any extra software ? you check a box in the settings menu and you are done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also auto-complete for forms and passwords and you can pick the default zoom level for the browser. Not that altering the zoom is that hard with pinch-zoom, naturally, being supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A neat feature allows you to access quick page controls (back, forward, refresh, bookmark etc.) by a swiping gesture performed near the right edge of the screen. You cannot have that and the classical interface though so you have to pick your priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, for the Flash performance ? the XOOM does okay with 360p videos right in the browser and 480p are watchable too (even if they do get slightly choppy at times). 720p Flash videos on the other hand are completely out of the question, though early reports suggest that the Android 3.1 update upgrades them to only mildly choppy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And this might have sounded good if it wasn?t for the fact that some Android smartphones are already doing 720p Flash and the Galaxy S II even manages 1080p. Obviously Motorola (or NVIDIA, we are not quite sure here) still has some catching up to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, if you find Flash content to slow down your page load times or cause stutter when panning, you can switch it to on-demand in the settings menu (or even turn it off all together).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a primary 5 megapixel camera and a 2 megapixel front-facing unit, the Motorola XOOM seems fit to meet the average smartphone user photography needs. It probably won?t produce the stunning shot to hang up on your wall, but it will do for the occasional snapshot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After all, taking photos with a tablet is hardly the most comfortable thing so we doubt any of the potential owners cares all that much about it. As long as the two cameras are there to provide the functionality needed for video-chatting and some augmented reality apps or games, it?s all fine. The possibility to snap a label or two as a memory aid comes as a welcome bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That?s why we aren?t going to take any points away from the XOOM because of the over-simplified interface. You get flash settings, white balance, color effects and scenes on a convenient dial as well as resolution settings, picture quality, focus mode and exposure compensation in the extra settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also shortcuts for switching between the two cameras and alternating video and still camera modes. Few users are ever going to need more than those available settings and shortcuts anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the image quality is average at best even if you only consider the 5 megapixel league. We aren?t particularly impressed with the amount of resolved detail and the colors are not particularly precise either. Dynamic range seems pretty limited too and generally the low noise levels are one of the few good things to say about the image quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>After saying this, it?s hardly a surprise that the XOOM didn?t quite impress in our lab conditions photo quality comparison. It managed to keep pace with its Atrix cousin, but the iPhone 4 just blew it out of the water when it comes to image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Motorola XOOM in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We find the fact that the Motorola XOOM is unable to record 1080p video slightly puzzling. After all, the Optimus 2X does it with the same chipset so it should be technically possible. Yet, we?ll let that one slip once again on the argument that tablets aren?t meant as imaging devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can record 720p videos with both cameras so it?s not too bad. Of course the quality will hardly blow your mind, but it should be good enough for the occasional YouTuber. Just make sure you have a place to rest your arms against or you are certain to end up with really shaky videos with a tablet that heavy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s  untouched video sample taken straight from the XOOM camera for you to enjoy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>

			<paragraph>Entering the XOOM into our video quality comparison tool revealed that the slate does worse in terms of resolved detail than the Atrix and even the iPad 2. The differences diminish in low light conditions and the XOOM even goes slightly ahead with its lower noise levels, but we really expected better.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The additional applications are the heart of every modern mobile platform. The more and the higher-quality they are the better the market prospects of their OS. For the XOOM this is a two-sided tale.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a customized Android market interface that lets you browse and search the hundreds of thousands of apps there quicker than ever before. The productivity is probably the best there is on the market and gaming is second only to the App store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand though only a handful of those apps are actually optimized for the XOOM. WVGA ones aren?t too pixelated but they are not perfectly smooth either. As to those meant for lower resolution ? you need not bother.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The performance is really a mixed bag with quite a lot of the apps we installed suffering mysterious lags. We are speaking of apps that run fine on single-core WVGA handsets and that we would?ve assumed to be a walk in the park for the XOOM. Alas, optimization is needed before the Motorola slate can really enjoy the same kind of freedom its smartphone cousins are getting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is those optimizations take time and developer commitment and, with the XOOM hardly selling in millions, we can see why coders are still sitting on a fence here. In that sense Motorola should probably be glad that competing Honeycomb tablets are released left and right nowadays ? only a sizeable market share will bring enough developer attention to the slate-friendly Android.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Motorola XOOM certainly is a must-see device. With powerful hardware and the custom-built tablet-friendly version of the world?s most popular handheld OS on board, the XOOM was supposed to be the standard-setter. And that?s not even taking into account its impressive connectivity set and good looks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, while the apps designed for the XOOM?s screen resolution are far less than what the Apple iPad 2 can use, things aren?t quite that bad. Regular Android apps designed for WVGA screens do scale up just fine so they will do until developers fix that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, even with all those boxes ticked, we wouldn?t quite recommend the XOOM at this point. While it might as well hold a hardware advantage over the iPad 2, the user experience is mediocre at best.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And for all we know, tablets are more about the user-experience than the functionality. Users who do need all the oomph will go for netbooks or ultra-portables, which are cheaper and can do more tasks than the current crop of tablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the tablets, well, their thing is being fun to use and snappy with their lightweight operating systems. Sadly, the XOOM fails to deliver on those exact expectations. And sales may continue to be slow for a while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola seems to have overlooked a key ingredient of the Android market success. Android smartphones are usually priced below their iOS competition and have much better value even if they don?t always manage to deliver an equally silky handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XOOM is in fact more expensive than the iPad 2, which makes it reallly hard to forgive any of its shortcomings. An exceptionally loyal user base allows Apple to charge more for their products and get away with it. For Motorola to be competitive, they need to play by the market rules.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XOOM?s price tag implies a product that?s notably better than the current market leader. But despite the added functionality and purpose-built interface, the XOOM just doesn?t quite cut it in terms of actual handling, speed and number of available apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So while Honeycomb shows some promise, it thus far feels more like a beta. And Motorola should be trying hard to get the user experience up to scratch before it?s too late for the XOOM.</paragraph>
