			<paragraph>Samsung L700 is a lower midrange fella and its main selling points are solid construction, metal body and fast 3G speeds. Before you frown at the shortish specs list do remember that it's not aiming high. It's set instead to address a chronic shortage of style in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are yet to see what kind of difference Samsung L700 will make, but you can bet it's going to be a tough fight against some pretty popular handsets there already. When we pick cell phones to review we rarely go down to this market segment, but our experience tells us the L700 will probably win its share of content customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While certainly not the hottest looker there is, we rarely see such commendable build quality and freehanded use of metal in the competition. We hit the pedal to the metal without much further ado to see how the L700 handles the race track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a handful of paintjobs for Samsung L700 but, knowing how things work, we doubt it all of them will see the mass market. Samsung usually sell the more interesting color versions to large retail chains or carriers so they can benefit from exclusivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our review deals with the garden variety, a.k.a. Titan Silver. A pre-release unit it is, so bear in mind that some of the stuff in this review may be subject to change before the actual handsets start shipping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L700 is heading full tilt to some tough and fierce competition at a starting retail price of around 150 euro (220 US dollars). That kind of cash opens up plenty of choice of similarly equipped devices. Of course, we do expect the price to start leveling off by Christmas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, there are Sony Ericsson W660 (about 140 euro) and Sony Ericsson K530 (about 110 euro). These two are practically identical and match the L700 to the smallest detail, except for the metal casing, slightly slimmer waistline and quad-band functionality. However we must note that the M2 memory cards they use are also slightly more expensive than the microSD variety the L700 supports.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Next up in the QVGA segment are the similarly equipped Sony Ericsson G502 (about 130 euro) and Sony Ericsson K660 (about 150 euro). They still don't offer quad-band GSM support, but top the L700 with HSDPA and higher-res screens. The Sony Ericsson G502 even takes a go at the slim girth and just misses it by less than a millimeter. The Sony Ericsson K770 Cyber-shot (about 150 euro) also offers similar specs and price tag but impresses with a much better 3 megapixel autofocus camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Sony Ericsson G502 ? Sony Ericsson K660 ? Sony Ericsson K770</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia offer in this segment is without doubt the now elderly and 3G-less Nokia 6300 (about 110 euro) and Nokia 3120 classic (about 130 euro). Nokia 6300 has a similar design and is slimmer. The QVGA display resolution is also a plus. The Nokia 3120 classic however matches the L700 with quad-band GSM functionality and slim silhouette and too outpaces it with the higher-res QVGA screen. Still, the 3120 classic is way too plastic to stand up to the full-metal jacket of Samsung L700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6300 ? Nokia 3120 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you really dig the metallic body of Samsung L700, you may go ahead and check out the slightly more expensive Sony Ericsson W890 (about 210 euro) and Samsung U800 Soul b (about 240 euro), which offer slimmer profile, HSDPA, higher-res screens and 3 megapixel cameras. Having taken the step up to that price bracket, you might as well have a look at the Nokia E51 (about 180 euro) - a Symbian smartphone with excellent build quality and Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson W890 ? Samsung U800 Soul b ? Nokia E51</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But enough on other phones - let's not steal the show from Samsung L700. The shiny brushed steel surface and excellent ergonomics are a short jump away.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung L700 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung L700 measures 109 x 46 x 12.8 mm and the styling is not exactly extrovert. Still, the materials used and the high build quality will connect with enough people, who won't settle for cheap plastic affordability. The 12.8mm worth of waistline is just about enough to miss the "slim" tag by a couple of millimeters. Still, it's not a large handset, and the weight of 107g pays back with comfortable hand-hold and lasting metal finish.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looks like we've made sure you figured it out by now that Samsung L700 is anything but a flash accessory. It's quite the other way around. The conservative laid-back design leaves an impression of a reliable, no-nonsense handset, extra solid and respectable thanks to the brushed metallic finish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The L700 has a bright and vivid 2.1-inch display, but the letdown is the relatively low resolution of 176 x 220 pixels. The same resolution did pass in the B2700 toughie but just doesn't feel quite right in L700. For the kind of money they charge, you could easily get yourself a handset with a QVGA screen. Above the display are the video-call camera and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad of Samsung L700 is a true joy to use. The large keys have excellent touch orientation and press. All the controls around the D-pad are laid out quite well and the metal accents immensely enhance the looks of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Samsung L700 hosts the microSD memory card slot, which as we managed to confirm, can handle cards of up to 8GB. The shutter key is strangely placed dead center on the left, which is not the most convenient position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Samsung L700 accommodates the universal connectivity port, which is used for plugging the charger, USB cable or the headset. The port is the regular Samsung type (the one used in the last two generations of their devices), so there's a decent choice of compatible after market accessories, should you need any.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice looking volume rocker is positioned a notch higher on the same right side of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the top and bottom part of the Samsung L700 are free of any controls. The only things, that may catch your eye at the bottom, are the microphone pinhole and the lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all metal design of Samsung L700 extends to the back too. The battery cover is made entirely of metal, much like the one of the more expensive Samsung Soul b.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2 megapixel camera lens on the back of L700 has a LED flash, but that would be little consolation if you need to shoot in the dark - it's nowhere near the performance of xenon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung L700 is powered by a 960 mAh Li-Ion battery. The battery has a relatively high capacity for this market segment, but still the Samsung L700 managed only about three days of moderate use on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ergonomics of Samsung L700 are commendable, so is the build quality. The all metal construction seems solid and durable, and the brushed finish is a boost to looks. The L700 is not the most compact of handsets but the solid feel in hand is a downright treat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Trimmed down user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung L700 interface has the typical Samsung styling - the default menu scheme is colorful icons on white background. The transition effects seen on more high-end models lack on the L700, but the menu response is admirably fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the transition effects, the other thing lacking is menu themes - there are none whatsoever, nor can any be added. The only thing that yields to user customization is the Home screen, which can either be the dynamic uGo variety or custom static wallpaper.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is straight to the point<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of Samsung L700 stores up to 1000 contacts with multiple fields. When viewing contacts, you can opt between displaying phone memory, SIM memory or both. Other than that, 21 fields of information are available for each contact including eight number fields.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dialing is extra easy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Signal reception with the Samsung L700 phone was excellent. A nice nifty feature that we see in all Samsung phones recently is the Smart dialing. When you punch in some digits the handset automatically fetches not only the contacts whose phone numbers have them, but also contacts whose names match the key input (much like T9 but for dialing). Effectively, that means that you may never need to dig in your contact list to find a contact to dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>True to its Samsung nature, the L700 also offers several dialing animations, which are cool in a way, even if a bit childish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the Samsung L700 stacks up against some of the other handsets we've measured in our speakerphone loudness test. L700 is a very good performer - it misses the Excellent score by a slim margin so it's unlikely that you miss calls even in noisy streets. You can find more info about our loudspeaker test, as well as the results of all other tested devices here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung L700 can handle SMS, MMS, and email. L700 will store up to 500 SMS messages, while MMS and email are limited only by the available memory. Naturally, a T9 dictionary is at hand, and it does its job quickly and intuitively. Incoming messages, like calls, can be blocked based on a user-defined black list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is relatively good and it even supports SSL, so it works flawlessly with providers that require it - like Gmail, for example.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>File manager and dummy picture gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung L700 file browser is pretty much standard for Samsung handsets. There are 40MB of inbuilt memory at your disposal. And of course, you can always top that thanks to the memory card slot, which supports cards with a capacity of up to 8GB. We checked that ourselves: 8GB cards have a green light on L700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager has preconfigured folders for different types of files - images, video, music, sounds, which allow the handset to sort the memory contents. You can copy or move files freely and you can create and delete folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture gallery is an inherent part of the file manager and not a separate application. Accessing it is as simple as opening the Images folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And again, you can sort files by date, type, name, and size. Unfortunately, you can view pictures only in portrait mode and there's no fullscreen view option. Otherwise zooming in on images is possible and it's not even too slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung L700 has ShoZu integration, meaning you can upload images and videos directly to ShoZu straight from the file manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player is worth it<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung handsets usually excel in music player capabilities (and audio quality too, we should add). The L700 music player offers various track sorting filters such as artist, album, genre, composer, and recents. There's also a podcast section in the music player menu. You can create your own playlists of course. The music player also makes use of album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can be minimized to play in the background, while the current track shows up on the standby screen. You can control the music player straight on the Home screen using your D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L700 is complete with an FM radio with RDS. The radio can run in the background. Additionally you can set a radio program as a wakeup alarm. And finally, there's an option to set a reminder for a broadcast that you don't won't to miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The L700 video player is a bit disappointing as it didn't play MPEG4 files. We guess it might be a pre-release issue, we are yet to see. Other than that you can fast-forward or rewind videos, and you can watch them fullscreen in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have made a name for themselves for the commendable audio quality of their handsets, which unfortunately, the Samsung L700 is trying to ruin. It has poor audio quality readings in almost every aspect. However, none of them are too disturbing so if you aren't much of a melomaniac it might not bother you too much. Anyway, the results are here for you to see and draw the conclusions. In case you want to learn more about our test, click here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image quality is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung L700 is equipped with a 2 megapixel camera with a maximum image resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels. There's also a LED flash. Auto focus is not part of the game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is intuitive and follows the current trend of displaying settings with icons in a toolbar at the bottom of the screen, while options appear as semi-transparent popup menus. The settings of the L700 camera are a bit trimmed down and include picture size, shooting mode (single, multi-shot, mosaic shot), color effects (black and white, negative, sepia), white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as image quality is concerned we are pleasantly surprised. The color rendering is fine, the detail is on a nice level, with even edge-to-edge sharpness. Usually there are some traces of noise suppression in the shadows but those are negligible. If it wasn't for the visible sharpening artifacts, we would have called the L700 an excellent performer. Still it's a good one nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some camera samples produced by the 2 megapixel camera of Samsung L700:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L700 shoots video in the so-called Camcorder mode. The user interface of the camcorder doesn't differ from the one of the still camera except for some of the available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L700 captures video in QCIF resolution (176 x 144 pixels) at 15fps and clips are recorded in 3GP format. That effectively means they are only good for MMS messaging.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser is a disappointment<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Samsung L700 you can count on EDGE and UMTS for browsing internet on the go. Unfortunately, the handset has a rather trimmed down version of the NetFront 3.4 web browser. There's no mouse pointer and there's no desktop-like scrolling and panning - the cursor just jumps from one hyperlink to the next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find On Page is also missing, there's no fullscreen mode and no mini-map and you can't rotate the screen to landscape view. Other than that it renders complex pages correctly and jumping around the links is really fast even before the page has fully loaded.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Clean-cut organizer plus Google on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung L700 calendar offers three views - daily, weekly and monthly. As usual, there are five types of events available: appointment, anniversary, holiday, important, and private. Alarm slots are also five, each with a variety of configurable options - snooze time, repetition, etc. You can of course choose a custom ringtone to wake you up at a preset volume level or you can use the FM radio for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the other offerings are a voice memo recorder, a world time application, a calculator, and a unit converter. A countdown timer and a stopwatch are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the available applications you will also find a Google package, which grants direct access to Google Search and Gmail. In practice these items are not real applications, but just links that open up in the web browser. There is also a RSS feed reader on board the Samsung L700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung L700 also features an office-document viewer along the lines of most Samsung handsets out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Games are yet to be seen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Rather unusual for Samsung, there were no games preinstalled on the Samsung L700 - not even trial ones. We guess that has to do something with our unit being a pre-release one. Our fair guess is that you should expect at least several titles in the final retail unit.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung L700 is a nice attempt to bring more style to the lower midrange market. Brushed metal finish and 3G are all it takes to get noticed in this segment. That said, the metal gear will come in handy, as the L700 will have some heavy competition blows to ward off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typical for the price bracket, strong assets are offset against some annoying shortcomings. The Samsung L700 trimmed down user interface does the solid and classy exterior no justice. It lacks customization options and has a poor picture gallery, which takes away some from the capable 2 megapixel shooter. The underperforming web browser fails to take full advantage of 3G data speed. There's a really good music player but audio quality is a letdown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the Samsung L700 sports Smart dialing, ShoZu and Google integration, and an office document viewer that might be enough to set it apart. Using it as a Bluetooth 3G modem for your notebook is also an option, so not all is lost in the web department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end it's a matter of priorities and above all - pricing. Anyway, the L700 seems a viable alternative to most handsets in the target segment of 100-150 euro, but another unfortunate trade off can't go unnoticed. Samsung L700 looks above its class, but performs below its looks.</paragraph>
