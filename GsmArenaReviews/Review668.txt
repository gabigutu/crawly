			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Traditionally, Acer is focusing its efforts in the low-end and mid-range sectors of the smartphone industry and at this year's Mobile World Congress, the company delivered a number of interesting smartphones. But not to stay behind the competition, the company also outed a smartband to go along them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Android space, Acer introduced a trio of smartphones - the Liquid Jade Z as well as the Liquid Z520 and Liquid Z220. Quite surprisingly, there's also a Windows Phone 8.1 device in the face of the Liquid M220.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us onto the coming pages to get our first impression of these devices plus live photos. Don't worry, the Liquid Leap Plus smartband is here as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Jade Z hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Out of Acer's MWC 2015 line-up, the Liquid Jade Z is leader of the group. It packs a MediaTek chipset with a 64-bit CPU and 1GB of RAM. The phone runs Android 4.4.4 KitKat and we're happy with its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone features a 5" IPS display of 720p resolution. At first glance, we thought the resolution is 1080p, it's that good looking. Part of the reason for this is the Zero Air Gap technology that Acer has embraced for the phone. There's also a Gorilla Glass 3 layer for protection on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid Jade Z takes on a similar design language from the Liquid Jade S. There are a few new touches here and there, though. The back is now done in a nice cross pattern design. It's not as smooth as the Jade S and this makes it feel grippy. Unfortunately, the glass on top of the Jade Z display isn't curved like on the Jade S - a feature we enjoyed on the previous model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nevertheless, the slim profile and lightweight have stayed. The Liquid Jade Z weighs 110 grams and measures 7.9mm thin. At the back of the phone, there's a 13MP snapper with LED flash, while a 5MP front-facing one will take care of selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer has kept the DTS Surround Sound simulating speaker at the back, but we couldn't determine if it's an upgrade over the one in the Liquid Jade S due to the noisy environment. Overall, we quite liked the Liquid Jade Z from our first encounter with it and with a price tag of ?199, it's definitely going to peek our interest again when it launches in March.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Z520 and Liquid Z220 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The company also announced the entry-level smartphones - Liquid Z550 and Liquid Z520. Starting off with the Liquid Z550, which packs a 5" LCD screen of WVGA resolution. We are less than impressed with it and as you would imagine, the resolution is far too low for a screen of this size. Additionally, the color are washed out and the contrast is unsatisfactory. To make matters worse, we noticed a bit of ghosting in places.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not all bad though, as the phone is powered by the Snapdragon 400 chipset sporting a 1.2GHz quad-core CPU and 1GB of RAM. The phone runs Android 4.4.2 quite well as a result. Internal storage is 8GB and is expandable via the on-board microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is available in black and sports a similar cross-pattern design on the back as the Liquid Jade Z. We don't have the dimensions of the phone just yet, but it's a bit on the bulky side. Still, you get DTS sound from the speaker at the back, which is a nice feature to have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Liquid Z520 on the other hand is the smaller brother with a 4" LCD display and a similar resolution of 480 x 800 pixels. Here, the 233ppi pixel density is more acceptable, but colors and contrast remain unsatisfactory. The design is also quite similar, but the phone is available in white and black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the white version features far grippier and sturdier battery cover and feels nicer than the black version. Sadly, this one is still on the bulky side, but feels nice in the hand due to its more compact dimensions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Powering the Liquid Z520 is a Snapdragon 200 chipset with a dual-core CPU and 1GB of RAM. We noticed some lag here and there, but nothing too bad as Android 4.4.2 KitKat is optimized for low-end devices like this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Liquid Z520 will go on sale in April for ?109, while the Liquid Z220 will be available this month for ?89.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid M220 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer Liquid M220 is company's second Windows Phone handset. It's an entry-level device with a retail price of &#x20ac;79 and a promised upgrade to Windows 10. Acer has only made only one Windows smartphone and it was back in the dawn of Windows Phone - the Acer Allegro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer Liquid M220 is the Windows counterpart of the Lollipop-based Liquid Z220. It packs a 4.0" display of WVGA resolution and runs on a dual-core 1.2GHz processor (probably Cortex-A7) coupled with half a gig RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 8.1 OS is in charge of operations, but Acer promises an update to Windows 10 for Phones later this year. The 512MB RAM won't be a problem as Microsoft has already announced Windows 10 will make it to phones with just 512MB RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone might be an entry-level device, but the M220 is surely a looker. Instead of a generic seamless design, Acer opted for a more flexible shell with Thai Silk-like textured rear cover and grippy ripped frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really liked what Acer did with the design and it definitely boosts the looks and the overall impression of the Liquid M220.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4" display offer an ok pixel density of 233ppi, but has poor viewing angles, modest contrast and what seemed like ghosting. The screen bezels are huge, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've probably noticed the flip case on the Liquid M220 on our photos - it's a very nice accessory but it will be sold separately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've played with the Acer Liquid M220 for a while and the grip is indeed excellent and we feel the panels are tough enough to survive a few accidental drops. The Windows Phone OS is smooth and hopefully it will continue to be after the Windows 10 update kicks off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer Liquid M220 will become available in the EMEA markets starting this April at &#x20ac;79. It will come in two flavors - Mystic Black and Pure White.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Acer Liquid Leap+ smartband hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Acer did not stop at smartphones though, and brought to MWC 2015 an updated version of their smartband. The Liquid Leap+ (mind the +) offers advancements over the previous generation in both design and features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the original Liquid Leap came in a range of bright colors, you were stuck with the one you chose at the store. The new one offers exchangeable straps, so the electronics brain of the smartband can be fitted into different wristbands to address style considerations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accessory features an understated design, which benefits from the buttonless concept of the predecessor and is entirely touch-operated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You wake the band with a double-tap and it does tend to fall asleep pretty quickly, but given its presumed usage scenarios, it should be good enough. The interface is limited by screen size, but nevertheless provides adequate capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1-inch OLED display offers visual feedback, while allowing the band to last five to seven days on a single charge, according to the company's claims.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The offered functionality is what you'd expect from your typical fitness tracker with a few added twists. You do get a step counter, distance measurement and calories burned, but also sleep tracking and remote control of the music player in your phone.</paragraph>
