			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been tempting lately to conclude that Apple doesn't have it anymore, and tablets in particular is where Cupertino does need to silence the prophets of doom and gloom after an iPad 4 that was more like a 3.1 and a mini that should've had a retina display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with, they could've done a lot worse than borrow a line from macbooks but the Air signature isn't just a PR stunt. It would be hard to believe it's the first time an iPad Air crossed anyone's mind as a cool name for a tablet but, by the looks of it, the iPad Air is very well the first that actually warrants it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just sounds right, doesn't it? And the iPad Air will definitely need all that crowd-pleaser ring when the fresh iPad mini with Retina display finally starts hitting the shelves. With Nexus tablets around, usual suspects Samsung, the new Surface, and now even Nokia on the list, an iPad has never arrived to such an unfriendly welcome. Yet, if Apple has done its job right, the Retina-flaunting mini will likely be the biggest threat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple iPad Air</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let's not get ahead of ourselves and give the iPad Air a proper introduction. Easily one of the hottest pieces of hardware we've seen deserves it. Honestly, to say that a diet was all the iPad needed would be a massive understatement - after the iPad 4, which deservedly gets retired. But the way the iPad Air looks is a start made in heaven. The Air is almost 2mm thinner, and has unbelievably lost near a centimeter on each side - it's mostly screen bezel that's gone. The weight difference is the whopping 183 grams. The screen - the same gorgeous 9.7" canvas with 2048 x 1536px resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the impressive loss of weight, the iPad Air has really stepped on the optimizations. There is a smaller battery powering the tablet but Apple promises the same 10 hours of battery life as before. The brains behind the tablet are the same as on the iPhone 5s - a class-leading 64-bit dual-core A7 chip that should be twice as fast as the predecessor's. The GPU is even a little more capable than on the iPhone, in keeping with the bigger display and higher resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple took a big step in the right direction with this year's iPad lineup by equaling the mini and the Air's specs, so the only thing you need to choose is the screen size that works best for you. This puts the iPad Air in a sticky position, as the mini's handling and portability could be the big decider. The iPad Air, by the way, is now much more comfortable to hold and the narrower casing does wonders for single-handed operation but there's no avoiding the fact that the iPad mini is the friendlier form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last season's bigger iPad at least had the luxury of being more powerful but those days are gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, it might turn out in the end that it's the mini that has more to live up to - and prove that it truly is an equal in terms of performance. The iPad Air on the other hand seems off to a promising start. Let's see if it can really keep it up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual accessories<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air comes with a lightning cable and an A/C adapter - hardly a surprise after a few generations of tablets already. There are of course the usual leaflets and a couple of stickers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple gets plenty of repeat customers, meaning the most likely people to buy the iPad Air are ones that already have at least one iPad. But is it worth it? When the iPad 4 came out, there was very little sense for iPad 3 owners to update but this time it's different.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air is a massive upgrade over the predecessors, not just in terms of its compact, light design, but a new, powerful chipset too and a new screen. Hopefully, the table below will give you the gist of iPad Air versus the outgoing iPad 4 and the iPad 2, which will stick around for another while.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Fit and fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Taking heavily after the original iPad mini, the iPad Air moves away from the sloping edges of old, resulting in a more muscular, and somewhat more compact feel, reinforced by the much thinner frame. The bezels around the screen have been significantly narrowed, which - convincingly - creates an impression of a much more immersive screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To run by the numbers, the iPad Air is a whopping 16.2mm narrower than its predecessor, 1.9mm thinner and 1.2mm shorter. The weight is probably the most radical of changes - having lost the unbelievable 183g, the new iPad Air takes a huge load off your hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The question still remains of how the Air will co-exist with the new iPad mini with Retina display, which simply is a downscaled replica. In terms of what rival platforms have to offer though, the iPad Air may actually enjoy a certain level of comfort and safety knowing it's the most compact big tablet in the market. On the other hand, the competition has mostly caught up and even edged forward in terms of screen resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air may premiere a new design (in the size-L category at least) but hasn't changed much in terms of controls. The front has the same 9.7" 1536 x 2048 IPS LCD of 264 ppi. Above it we find the same 1.2 MP resolution front-facing camera capable of 720p video capture. There's also an ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the screen lies the familiar home button. Many must've been hoping for a Touch ID scanner on the iPad Air but to no avail. Perhaps next year?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the home button seems to have a more solid click compared to our iPhone 5s but it could also just be a unit-specific quirk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is completely bereft of controls, while on the right we find the silencer switch (that will also lock screen orientation) and the two volume keys. They have solid feedback and are generally very comfortable, the only problem is getting to them in either portrait and landscape as they are very far off your fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the first time on a full-grown iPad we find stereo speakers. These are hardly unforeseen since we saw those first on the original iPad mini, but the pleasant surprise is they are impressively loud. In fact the whole slate vibrates when they're pumping out sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the now typical Lightning connector port at the bottom. The top is reserved for the 3.5 mm headphone jack and one of the two microphones. The audio jack placement is a little inconsistent - the iPhone has its on the bottom and it would make much more sense to have it there on the iPad too to not have cables running over the screen when you've attached a set of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second microphone is on the back along with an Apple logo with a mirror finish. In the top left corner sits a 5 MP iSight camera, which hasn't seen any technical upgrades besides a reportedly improved backside sensor illumination. Aperture is still set at f/2.4 and the camera still lacks an LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While immense progress has been made by Apple to reduce the burden of handling an iPad Air, the tablet is still on the big side perhaps for single-handed operation. However, when held with both hands the device fits nice and comfortable and the bezels are just enough on both sides for your thumbs to rest without getting into the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We love thin bezel designs as they put the screen more into focus but what makes the iPad Air a better tablet than its predecessors is the huge weight difference. Being 183g lighter, the iPad Air is easier to handle for prolonged periods of time without making your hands numb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It still not the lightest of loads to keep standing in your hands but, compared to other big tablets like the current Nexus 10 or the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, the iPad Air really does live up to its name.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Well-known premium screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple introduced the Retina display back in 2012 on the third-generation iPad and hasn't increased the resolution since. The competition has meanwhile caught up, with Samsung-made droids inching forward with tablet displays of 2560 x 1600 probing 300 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, you're likely to look at the iPad Air's screen from an arm's length where things look as crisp as possible, even compared side by side with a Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. Looking at the screen from really up close doesn't reveal the pixels and things tend to be nicely sharp and readable - even small fonts on web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is the same as before (read iPad 3 and 4) - you get a standard red, green and blue pixel side by side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the numbers the iPad Air stacks pretty well against the competition. The ASUS Transformer Pad TF701T, which we recently reviewed, seems like the only tablet that beats the iPad Air hands down, while the Sony Xperia Tablet Z has a slight edge. Otherwise we'd easily deem the iPad Air's 9.7" screen one of the best on the market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air has to make do with a smaller battery than the 11560mAh behemoth found in the iPad 4 but Apple still claims 10 hours of web browsing. The new battery is a 32.4Wh unit compared to the 42.5Wh of the predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air did more than enough to live up to Apple's claims and then some. The slate managed a 10:20 hour run in our browsing test and 12:49 hours of video playback. It didn't quite beat ASUS' Transformer Pad TF701T we recently reviewed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPad Air runs on iOS 7<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air runs buttery smooth with iOS 7, a major overhaul to the user interface with brand-new flat looks, transparent menus and keyboard, new system icons and apps, new control center and much more. The iOS 7 has already made its way to the compatible iGadgets out there and is already quite familiar, but its adoption rate is not as good as previous iterations because some users simply don't like the new looks. Anyway, we'll explore the iOS 7 thoroughly as we usually do, so don't you worry if you think you've missed something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we continue, here is a quick video demonstration of the new iOS 7 running on the iPad Air:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 looks a lot different compared to its predecessors, but its logic of operation is mostly the same. All of your apps are on the homescreen, folders are available and there is the familiar dock that can take up to four shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All system icons are different in the iOS 7: the clock now has an animated icon showing the current time, the system fonts have been altered, and there are lots of semi-transparent elements and new gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start from the beginning - the lockscreen. It's totally different and yet it works in a very similar way. The slide to unlock bar is now gone and you can swipe anywhere on the screen to unlock your iPad Air. The? camera shortcut at the bottom is also avaialble, you can swipe up from there for quick access to the camera app. A double press of the Home key will bring up the multimedia controls as usual. Lockscreen notifications are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can notice two transparent small lines at the top and the bottom of the lockscreen. Swiping from the top down will display Notifications, while swiping up from the bottom will bring up the new Control Center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen out of the way reveals the revamped homescreen. The Spotlight pane is now gone - but not lost. It's just triggered by a new pull-down gesture anywhere on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders are available as usual, but there is no limit anymore to how many apps you can put inside them. Pages are available in the folders, each page can pack up to nine apps and there is no limit on the page count. Now you can finally put the Newsstand app away in a folder!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opening and closing of folders is now accompanied by a cool animation. These take a bit too long, though, and might become irritating once you are past their initial "wow" phase. Another cool bit involves the folder icons and the folders themselves being semi-transparent and their backgrounds adapt to the prevailing theme color. You can disable the folder animations, the opening and closing app animations plus the parallax effect from General -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; Reduce Motion. This will speed things a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification and Control Center colors are also adaptive, just like the folders, and they'll change depending on the background. So they might be blue-ish on the homescreen, but light gray in the web browser, or dark gray in the settings, or green in the gallery, etc. Unlike the iPhones' keyboard, the one in the iPad is not semi-transparent, nor is its background adaptive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is observable throughout iOS 7. Apple designed the new iOS on independent layers - background, homescreen icons, icon badges, and then app pop-ups. The iPad Air then uses its accelerometer and gyroscope to move layers independently and create an illusion of depth. The movement is very subtle. In fact, you might not even notice it if you are not looking for it, but it's there and it looks awesome once you start moving your device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is not only available on the homescreen. You can see it in folders and in the pop ups that ask you for passwords or display notifications. Those pop ups by the way are also translucent and adapt their background color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you don't like the parallax effect you can turn it off from the Accessibility settings -&gt; Reduce Motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple iOS 7 brings live wallpapers. You can find them in the relevant section of the Wallpaper Settings. Currently there are seven live wallpapers but there is no wallpaper section available in the App Store. It seems we'll have to rely on Apple for adding more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple decided not to follow the competition and put the connectivity toggles in the notification area. They're in a brand new Control Center instead, that's pulled up with a swipe from the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has two of non-customizable rows for various shortcuts. The top row has the music controls, five toggles - Airplane, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, DND mode and Rotation Lock., plus two shortcuts - Clock and Camera. The second row has the volume and brightness sliders flanking the AirDrop and AirPlay shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification Center has been redesigned as well and now occupies the entire screen. It now has three tabs - Today, All and Missed. The Today tab has the date, a summary of all events for the day, calendar day view, reminders and tomorrow's summary. As usual, you can choose which apps you want to show up in the pull-down Notifications and in what order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no option to add stocks in the iPad's notification center, as the iPad doesn't come with the native Stocks app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Today tab is customizable, and you can disable its elements one by one - everything but the date displayed at the top can be removed so it doesn't get in the way. You can even disable the Today tab altogether in the Notification Center for the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The All tab is basically the notification center from iOS 6 but sans the weather, stocks and calendar events. The first two are now part of the Today tab, while the weather is gone for good. You can disable the All tab for the lockscreen as well (just turn off Notifications View). If both Notifications (All) and Today tabs are disabled, the entire Notification Center will no longer be available on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Missed tab displays new emails, messages and missed FaceTime calls you received while your iPad Air was locked. Those notifications are still available in the All tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the handling of notifications hasn't changed a bit. You can opt to disable a notification, set it to be a banner, which will shortly pop up over the status bar or an alert showing up at the center of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also options to disable badges on app icons or disable lockscreen notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The banner notification is very subtle. If you receive a text in the middle of something, it will briefly pop up over the status bar and disappear in a couple of seconds, and not distract from what you're doing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Do Not Disturb mode is available on the iPad Air too. It gives users further control of notifications, or rather their suppression. If turned on, it will mute incoming FaceTime calls or alerts. You can allow FaceTime calls from your favorite contacts and have the option to set a specific time interval in which you won't get any notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dedicated toggle to activate the DND feature and it can be customized in the Notifications submenu. When Do Not Disturb is on, a crescent icon appears next to the clock in the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to Apple, iOS 7 offers multi-tasking for all apps. Previously true multi-tasking was reserved only for navigation or music streaming apps, the rest had to go in suspend mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, this multi-tasking for all apps will surely drain the battery faster than Apple would have liked, so there is a catch. Yes, all apps will work in the background, but iOS will learn which one of them you use most often and when.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's say you open the Facebook app every morning and don't use it for the rest of the day. iOS will soon learn that and will optimize the app to work according to your schedule until you change it. This means most of the day and night the app will still be in suspend mode (push notifications will work of course), but iOS will run Facebook shortly before your alarm goes on and load all the content. That way when you open it, your news feed will be already updated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed that apps also update in the background when push notifications come in. This is a part of what Apple calls opportunistic updates - the iPad waits until a data connection is available and starts the updates then, so it doesn't need to activate the connection on another occasion and waste your battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All apps that use Cellular/Wi-Fi connection and can work in the background are listed under Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Background App refresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task-switcher interface is invoked with a double tap on the Home key. It looks a lot like the webOS cards of old and, more recently, the HTC Sense Task switcher - all apps are presented with cards that you can swipe up to close. Each card has the respective app icon so you can easily recognize what's what.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multitasking UI works in both portrait and landscape mode, but you cannot see more than three cards at a time. It's one of the limitations of the card interface and we suspect this is why HTC went for a different task switcher with the One, but here's hoping that Apple will at least fix the landscape mode down the line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four/five-finger multi-tasking gestures are also available on the iOS 7 running on iPad Air. You can switch between the active apps using four (or five)-finger swipes. A similar swipe to the top will bring you the task switcher. Finally, you can use four (or five as it feels more natural) finger pinch zoom out. It will bring you the homescreen, while the app will go in background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 Settings menu has the same layout as in previous iPad versions but updated with the new flat and borderless look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing worth mentioning is the Vimeo and Flickr integration in addition to Twitter and Facebook. Once you enter your account details in the settings you can upload your photos straight to your Flickr gallery, while your videos will go to your Vimeo. You just need to hit the share key on a picture or a video and use the dedicated Flickr/Vimeo icon.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple iPad Air is running on the same chipset the Apple used within the iPhone 5s - the A7. It's company's first 64-bit mobile system-on-a-chip and as usual Apple claims it is twice as fast as the previous A6 chip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple A7 28-nm chip is comprised of a 1.3GHz dual-core CPU dubbed Cyclone which uses ARM's ARMv8 microarchitecture (yet to premiere with the Cortex-A53 and Cortex-A57 processors). The GPU, while not officially confirmed, is believed to be the PowerVR G6430. The use of a 64-bit instruction set for the CPU enables Apple to put more than 4GB of RAM on its future generation of products, but the iPad Air, just like the iPhone 5s, packs just 1GB. Not that this feels insufficient - the way iOS handles multi-tasking you are extremely unlikely to run out of operating memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to actual benchmarks we start with the Geekbech 3 test to see how the CPU and memory are doing. The iPad Air blasted through the test managing to beat every device we've tested so far but the Galaxy Note 3. It scored very close to the iPhone 5s and the Snapdragon 800 competition though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran the iOS version of Linpack. Once again, iPad Air scored a hair better than the iPhone 5s, which has the same chipset. It is also twice as better as the previous A6 chip, just as promised.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's time for the multi-platform GFX Benchmark that gives the GPU a run for its money. The iPad Air took the second place in our all-time chart, just few fps shy of beating the Galaxy Note 3 for the top spot. The iPad Air did better than the iPhone 5s by a whisker, again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran the GFX Benchmark on-screen tests. Quite expectedly, because of the iPad Air's higher resolution screen, it delivered a lower framerate than the iPhone 5s on the high-quality T-Rex graphic test. Still, the iPad seems perfectly equipped to handle every modern game hassle-free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we put the iPad Air through the SunSpider and BrowserMark benchmarks to test Safari's JavaScript and overall browsing performance. The iPad Air with its new iOS 7 operating system scored the same as the iPhone 5s on SunSpider and just a few points better on BrowserMark 2. Clearly, Apple has put special attention into the web browsing performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basically the iPad Air is as fast as the iPhone 5s. It has higher resolution to handle though, so it delivers a bit lower GPU performance than the iPhone 5s, but is still one of the most capable and powerful devices we've seen so far. The new CPU architecture and the latest generation PowerVR Series 6 GPU are currently the best performers on the market and will leave nobody disappointed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>New Siri does more, understands new languages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A new iOS version just can't afford to pay no attention to Siri. After more than two years in development the assistant has finally graduated from beta.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as the rest of the iOS 7, Siri now looks different. It always launches in full-screen and has a real-time voice graph. Another UI novelty is the option to edit your voice request with the keyboard in case Siri didn't hear you right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri supports and understands English (American, Canadian, Australian, British), French (France, Canada, Switzerland), German (Germany, Switzerland), Japanese, Italian (Italy, Switzerland), Spanish (Mexico, Spain, US), Mandarin (China, Taiwan), Korean, and Cantonese (Hong Kong) languages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most important Siri upgrades, of course, are under the hood. Siri now has Wikipedia integration and it offers new voices, there is both female and male English US for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri can also carry out commands affecting the iOS - it can turn Bluetooth or Wi-Fi on/off, increase brightness, play voicemails, check other people's social network status, play iTunes Radio stations, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri is a really powerful voice assistant capable of POI search. Assistance with restaurant booking is part of Siri's set of skills. It will find you exactly the restaurant you are looking for and filter the results based on user reviews. You can run impressively detailed searches based on food type, location, outdoor, pool, price range, ratings, etc. This feature is not available in every country, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri also answer slots of questions and isn't limited to game scores. History, stats, player bios, player comparison, teams, records, etc. Siri should be able to return most of the info right onto its own screen, without switching over to the browser. The same applies to movies. You will get all of your movie-related answers right inside the Siri window - anything about actors, directors, awards, movie stats, premieres and tickets, reviews, trailers, etc.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is the easiest way to initiate FaceTime calls or send iMessages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has been updated with the new iOS borderless look and simple color scheme. The logic behind the phonebook app is completely the same though, so if you've owned an iPad you'll know your way around right away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual the phonebook offers Facebook and Twitter integration. After you set up your accounts the phonebook will automatically ask you to link your existing contacts with their social ones (if available).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can search via the dedicated Search field at the top of the list of contacts or you can use the alphabetical scroll at the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact is intuitive and gives you the option to include lots of additional fields, like several addresses, related people, web, email, birthdays, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set different FaceTime ringtones, iMessage tones and vibration to your favorite contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since iOS 6 your iMessage and FaceTime ID is joined and the phonebook will automatically detect if either service is available with each contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FaceTime telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>FaceTime comes as a system app in iOS 7. It works both over a cellular data or Wi-Fi. The service now offers voice calls too, in addition to video conference chats. With FaceTime audio calls and iMessages, iOS users won't need Viber as much to connect with other iOS users free of charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we've tested the loudspeaker performance of the new iPad Air. It matched the Good score of its predecessor. This means you should be able to hear your slate in semi-noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The raw loudness value doesn't quite tell the whole story - the Air's speakers put out a more pleasing sound than those of previous iPads. The move to stereo speakers helps, but since they are both at the bottom it's easy to cover them when holding the tablet horizontally.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iMessaging available, the app has new looks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Messages app also gets the new iOS skin. It adds a new option in the conversation view - Contact. If you tap on this key, you'll get options to FaceTime (audio or video) that user, or go to their phonebook profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iMessage service lets you exchange instant messages between iOS 5 or later running iGadgets over Wi-Fi or 3G. You can send plain text as well as multimedia (pictures, sounds, videos) messages. A cool thing about the iMessages is that each conversation is synced with the iCloud so you'll have it right there and available on all your iDevices, including your Mac (although synchronization is not flawless and the time stamps would get messed up at times).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty simple - you type, you add content (optional) and hit send. Adding multimedia is done either by hitting the small picture icon next to the text field or through the sharing menu in the gallery or supported apps (Voice Memos, Notes, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default Mail client has the new looks but the functionality is unchanged. In portrait mode the left bar with all your emails remains hidden until prompted while in landscape you get both the inbox/emails bar visible and the email you've opened is on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VIP lists are available - emails from people on the list will be delivered to a dedicated VIP mailbox and will appear highlighted in the regular inbox. You can also set a different notification regime for VIP emails - so they appear on the lockscreen, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also flag important emails. After you flag your first message, a new Flagged mailbox will appear gathering all of your flagged emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching pictures and videos while composing an email is possible since the iOS 6 - just tap and hold on an empty space and use the popup menu. Bold, Italic and Underline font styles are available in the text editing options, as well as quote font size levels. Text selection works the usual way (tap&amp;hold and select) and the available options will appear as soon you've made the selection: Cut/Copy/Replace/Bold Italic Underline/Quote Level. Quote Level will increase / decrease the quote symbols before the text you're quoting. Finally there is a built-in dictionary. It's very rich in content and conveniently works offline.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Siri-powered dictation is available pretty much in any app that supports keyboard input. You need just to hit the corresponding button on your keyboard and start dictating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard on the iPad Air is exactly the same as on the previous iPads and knows the same tricks. You can undock the keyboard, which places it dead center on the screen. You can then move it up or down, depending on what's underneath and where you would like to place it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also split the keyboard in two by doing a simple pinch gesture on it or selecting it from the keyboard options. This is pretty useful in both portrait and landscape orientations if you have to type while holding the tablet - reaching the middle of the screen with your thumbs is hard, even when you hold the iPad Air in portrait orientation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The new gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photos app has been redesigned more thoroughly. To begin with, the Photos tab looks better organized. Prior to iOS 7 we used to get a grid of all of photos there, sorted by date. Images are now organized by date and location, for those that have been geo-tagged. This view is called Moments, with a description always at the top, with time, place and date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moments view offers multiple photos selection - you can select an entire folder with just a single tap. Mass Delete, Share (including AirDrop) and Add To Album options are available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go a step back, to Collections view where you can better view your sorted photos into groups with labels and much smaller thumbs. Those thumbs are still clickable, you can even scroll them to find the one you're looking for (small thumbs are hard to navigate through though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a city label in Moments or Collections will take you to the old Places view, where you get a map with pins showing where exactly your photos were taken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Year view. It squeezes your collection into tight grids for each year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is Shared photos - it has all your Photo streams. Photo Stream, which acts like a social sub-network, works really well and is very simple to set up. You choose what pictures to share and which people to share with. Your buddies on the receiving end will be able to like them and post comments. You can invite users you want to share your Photo Streams with via email or get invited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the third tab is albums. You get three default album types - camera roll, my photo stream and panoramas. Albums can be added, edited and deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are displayed in full size and you can delete, share or edit them. From the sharing menu you also get advanced options such as copy, assign to contact, slideshow, print, use as wallpaper and AirPlay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can AirDrop multiple pictures from this interface as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photo editor is the same as before with a new option to add filters. It supports rotation, cropping, filters and red-eye removal. There's also an Enhance option too. In Edit mode five keys appear at the bottom for the available editing options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Every new iPad Air offers you iPhoto and iMovie powerful Apple apps for free. The iPhoto allows you also to organize your photos by albums, photo books and you can even create journals - collages of photos you can share via iCould and make it visible to anyone. The iPhoto app has richer editing options than the standard gallery. It has been updated finally with the flat iOS 7 skin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the powerful iMovie editor is available for free as well, you just need to download it once you sign in on the AppStore. You can make your own movies and trailers by adding, cutting, merging, etc. videos, songs and pictures. The app is nicely functional and performs excellently on the A7 chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Limited video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many things have changed in iOS 7 but the video player is definitely not one of them. You can upload only supported formats via iTunes or purchase videos from the iTunes store. This is an extremely disappointing showing by a platform that is supposed to excel at multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of extra functionality is bad enough, but having to use just an extremely limited number of media format or resorting to converting files, which is both slow and inconvenient is a real deal-breaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music Player and iTunes Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS 7 music player is exactly the same as the one in iOS 6, its appearance is in line with the new iOS design. You can create playlists, delete songs right from within the player and reorder tabs whichever way you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen hasn't changed in functionality neither is the settings. Even in its seventh major iteration iOS still fails to offer configurable equalizers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are logged in with a US Apple ID (the service will roll out in more countries soon), your iOS 7 music player will get an additional iTunes Radio tab. It's a music streaming service with the entire iTunes content available for streaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stations are divided by genres, but once you add a station, you can choose to remove artists or add more songs from an artist/group. You can preview a station before adding it to your list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you like a particular song, you can buy it with just one tap. History is available and you can always return to buy songs later. A Wish List is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Radio is ad-free if you are using iTunes Match. Otherwise, every 7 to 10 songs are broken by about 15sec of commercials.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Amazing audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air was certainly among the most impressive performance in our audio quality test of all times. With no resistance applied to its line-out, the iPad Air posted excellent scores in every part of the test and garnished them with excellently high volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones didn?t change a whole lot about the iPad Air output either. The quality of the audio produced by the tablet remained great, with the little extra stereo crosstalk very hard to detect outside of our lab. Volume levels remained impressively high, to round up a top-notch overall performance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Improved camera hardware and software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air keeps the camera from the previous iPad - a 5MP shooter that can record 1080p video. The only thing that has reportedly changed is that the sensor has benefited from an improved backside illumination technology.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing FaceTime camera has not changed much either, it offers the same resolution, but the sensor size is slightly larger thus offering slightly bigger pixels and hence offering a slightly better low light performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 brings a brand new camera interface with some cosmetic changes (it's flat) and it's more usable. On the iPad, all the controls are combined in one column - a front/back camera toggle, an HDR toggle and the virtual shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air has three shooting modes you can move between by swiping up and down on the screen, you can't just tap the labels (even thought they are certainly big enough). The modes are Video, Photo and Square - there's no panorama, nor is there a 120fps mode like on the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Square photographs have, of course, been popularized by Instagram and so have photo effects. That's another thing missing on the iPad Air camera app though, no color effects. You do have Photo Booth, which shows a 3 x 3 grid with live preview of the effects, but you have to exit the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera supports AF/AE lock as usual with tap and hold on the viewfinder - this can be of great help with tricky scenes. There's no geotagging on the Wi-Fi only iPads, as they don't have GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is very good for a 5MP shooter and better than the previous iPad for sure. Noise is kept well under control. The noise reduction does smear out some detail, but sharpness is good enough. White balance is pleasing (it leans slightly towards warm) though color rendering is off. It's an excellent camera for a tablet - it gives you good enough photos in those emergency situations when you just have nothing else at hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped an HDR sample with the camera. This mode enhances highlights but makes little to no difference in the shadows. Also note that the noise levels go up a bit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPad Air photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can check out how the iPad Air does in our three standard charts against its predecessor (iPad 3, 4 and mini, the iPad 2's camera was sub-1MP) and a few others in our database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Apple iPad Air in our photo quality comparison tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air's camera records 1080p video at 30fps, which is the most popular option at the moment, even among smartphones. Note that the front-facing camera doesn't have enough resolution for 1080p, so you'll have to make do with 720p for video selfies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During video recording you can change the focus point and zoom, but there's no option to snap a photo (that option was very limited on the iPhone so we don't miss it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard 1080p videos @ 30fps are captured at a bitrate of 17Mbps, which is about average for Androids too. Most disappointingly, the iPad Air continues to capture mono sound (64Kbps, 44.1kHz) just like its predecessor and the iPhone 5s. Why Apple refuses to do stereo sound in video is beyond us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is great - videos are smooth, have no noticeable noise and manage a good level of detail. The videos carry over the warmer white balance of the still photos, but saturation is low, which throws off the color accuracy. There's no pixilation or jumpy continuous autofocus, which are our most common complaints for other mobile cameras.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Powerful connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Air comes in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular options. The latter version supports quad-band GSM, CDMA, quad-band 3G, CDMA200 1x EV-DO, plus a plethora of LTE bands (note that all of these are data-only). The LTE modem in the Air supports all bands Apple needs, so you don't need to worry about which model you have to get (unlike the iPhone).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both versions of the iPad Air supports dual-band (2.4 GHz as well as 5 GHz) Wi-Fi a/b/g/n. Two wifi antennas and MIMO technology can potentially double the data speeds, compared to the previous versions of the Apple slates. Some droids on the other hand support the latest 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard, which also boosts transfer speeds. Tethering is supported, although it's up to your carrier if you'll be able to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP support, but that's hardly any good for data transfers. Apple has never allowed sending and receiving files via Bluetooth like you would do on any other non-Apple device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a new feature in the connectivity department of iOS 7 called AirDrop, a system-wide file sharing service between supported iDevices, which needs to have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop is available in every share menu throughout the iOS 7. You can send pictures, videos, App Store and iTunes links, Notes, Maps links, all kind of files from file managing apps (i.e. Filer, Flash Drive, Air Disk, etc.), Office docs, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there are people with AirDrop service around you, they will automatically appear in the dedicated AirDrop field. You just mark your files, select people and hit the send key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop won't work with other phones and PCs, but will work on Macs running on OS X Mavericks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regular USB mass storage isn't available but there's a workaround using the iTunes computer software. You can transfer whatever files you want, but those are only made available to the app that you've dropped them onto. Good thing is you are not restricted to files compatible with said app and you can simply drag &amp; drop files that you would download on another computer later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, hardware storage expansion is still off limits in Apple's policy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air Wi-Fi + Cellular has a built-in A-GPS receiver with GLONASS support, but the Wi-Fi only tablet does not (this is standard for iPads).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple is continually improving its Find My iPad service. The latest iOS 7 updates it with the so-called Activation Lock. This will not only protect your personal data but also make your iDevice inoperable once wiped, unless you enter your Apple ID. This means the stolen or lost iGadgets will be of no use to thieves or finders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iCloud was an integral part of iOS 5 and is present here in iOS 7. It syncs all of your important data between all of your devices running iOS 5 or above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get 5GB of free storage but you can buy more if you want. Selecting which apps to sync is pretty easy. iCloud even remembers each device you've backed up so you can restore them separately if you wish. You can naturally delete older backups to free up space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has records on exactly what apps you've purchased, what you have installed on an iDevice and what you've deleted for some reason. Apple keeps tabs on this for each of your iDevices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you chose to sync with iCloud, Apple will sync only the app's personal data, not the entire IPA file (as iTunes did). Here is an example:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Say, you have Angry Birds installed on your iPhone and it has 1.5MB worth of saved data. Apple will sync only this file. If you delete the game and later install it again (free, from the Purchased list), your iPhone will download the original IPA from the App Store and will get back this 1.5MB file too - a lot more natural to sync an app rather than keep the entire image. If you use an app as USB storage (Filer or even CineXPlayer), then, by default, the whole content will be backed up too, eating your backup quota quite fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one more thing with the iCloud app sync - when you buy a new app, it will be pushed to all of your iDevices automatically (if available and if you have enabled this feature in the AppStore settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple has announced a new connectivity mode that will be supported in a wide range of vehicles, starting in 2014 - iOS in the car. You will be able to see your iPhone screen on your compatible car display. And you will be able to control it via your car controls or just tell Siri via your car audio system what it is you want it to do for you on your iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will be able to use navigation, dictate messages, make calls, play music or iTunes radio, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Among the confirmed car manufacturers to integrate the new service are Honda, Mercedes, Nissan, Ferrari, Chevrolet, Infiniti, Kia, Hyundai, Volvo, Opel, Jaguar and Acura.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The mobile Safari is an excellent browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad Air screen comes with the latest Safari browser, which is part of iOS7. It has new looks and several new features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first thing you'll notice is the unified search/address field. Just as on today's modern computer browsers, you can enter a search term straight into the browser address bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, you no longer need to use the Back button of the browser. As of iOS7, there is a really nice gesture that can do that instead. A right swipe across the screen but starting offscreen would instantaneously open the previous page that you had opened.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari finally supports more than 8 simultaneously opened web tabs. The tabs on the iPad's Safari are always visible as opposed to the iPhone, which makes moving between them easier. You can also rearrange the tabs, you can add new ones or switch to private browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you switch to private browsing, you'll need to either close all current tabs or migrate them to Private as well. It's not possible to have private and non-private tabs open simultaneously like in Google Chrome. When you are browsing in Private mode, Safari switches to a dark gray color scheme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, you can also use iCloud to sync tabs between your Safari-running devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you open your History you'll find a new tab called Shared Links (those come from social networking apps, so you'll need one installed). Here you'll find all links from your Twitter timeline, with authors and comments. If you hit the Share button you can bookmark a page if you'll need it long term or add it to the reading list for articles you want to read later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari in iOS 7 supports the iCloud keychain where you can store all of your passwords and credit card info (sans the security code). There is also a password generator available, in case you are out of ideas. What's good about this setup is that all your saved content from the computer version of Safari is now available straight on your phone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like before, if a page is compatible with the integrated Reader (most of the article pages out there are) you get a Reader button right into the address bar as soon as the page loads. The Reader strips the webpage of ads and makes the layout and font size more suited to a smaller screen. And best of all, if you are reading a multi-page article (such as our reviews) getting from one page to the next is automatic as soon as you scroll to the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Safari web browser on the iPad doesn't have a fullscreen mode as the iPhone does. The addressbar and the tabs are always visible both in landscape and in portrait mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Office Suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple's iWorks suite including Pages, Numbers, and Keynote is available for free (note that you have to download it, those are not pre-installed). The latest versions of the apps have had the iOS 7 makeover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages allows you to import, create or edit documents (DOC and DOCX are supported). It isn't as powerful as some of its Android counterparts, but it covers all the basics and will do an excellent job for most users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numbers supports Excel files and also covers all major features you'll probably need - charts, formulas, tablet formatting, the lot. There are many themes that will help you quickly create complicated spreadsheets even if you don't know how to do a scatter chart (looking at how the templates work is a good way to learn).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Keynote opens and edits (PowerPoint) presentations. It has all the tools you'll need to create a decent presentation from scratch, including tons of beautifully designed themes. You get comprehensive editing options including adding multimedia, tablets, charts and customizable transitions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily import files via iTunes and use iCloud for backup and sync.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar app has been revamped as well and has a very useful new feature. You can now drag and drop events if you want to move them to different days. Just tap and hold on an event, and you can move it to a different day and hour.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar benefits greatly from Facebook integration. Birthdays and events from Facebook are immediately synced with your calendar. Other online calendars like Google can also be synced and you have the option to omit them from the Calendars tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view by list (iOS's agenda variant), day and month. There's also a toggle to get back to today if you've strayed too far away. Events are color-coded so you can recognize what's what upon a quick glance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Events are entered the same way as before. You can choose which calendar you want the event to be synced with, add a location, additional notes and set up an alert.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Calendars tab, you can customize the iCloud personal and job-related event colors to your liking. You can also create additional calendar entries, for example if you have two jobs (or projects), etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reminders interface has been changed as well. It comes with a couple of default lists - Scheduled and Reminders, but you can create your own lists as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up a reminder is easy. The available options are time, place, repeat, priority and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The refreshed Note app has a split screen interface - tap on Notes to bring out a list of all notes in the current account, then tap Accounts to view all accounts. Once you select a note, the side panel automatically hides. You can share, copy and print notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app has got a new skin as well. It has world clock, alarms, stopwatch and a timer. You can set any of the songs in your music library as an alarm tone. You can also choose from your custom ringtones. The world clock shows the time in six locations at once (but you can scroll to reveal more slots) and you get a world map with all the cities, complete with a weather forecast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iBooks UI is still pre-iOS 7 with the old wooden bookcase design, which already looks out of place. The app offers various font and color settings, but on a screen this size, it's just not the best e-reading experience. You can read books in portrait mode or flip to landscape to see two pages at once.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose different fonts, reduce and increase the text size, change the background and play around with brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iBooks app is also a PDF viewer, which is one way to sideload books.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has replaced Google with TomTom as the map provider for the iOS native Maps application. It also offers voice-guided navigation courtesy of Siri. The navigation will work even on the lockscreen or in the background. Real-time traffic reports are available and Apple is also crowdsourcing the live traffic info anonymously from iOS users on the road. Sadly, there isn't an option to pre-cache maps for offline use, which can be a problem if you need guidance abroad or when you don't have signal. Still, if you set up a route when you have internet access, Maps will cache the maps needed to guide you along the way so you can finish your trip even without an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As of iOS 7, the navigation service also includes turn-by-turn walking directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you enable the 3D view (outside navigation) you will be able to explore cityscapes from birds-eye view. The currently available selection is quite limited, but more and more areas are joining Flyover in time. You can zoom, tilt and rotate using two-finger gestures to explore 3D landmarks rendered in real time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When Maps launched with iOS 6 it was quite a disappointment because of its poor map data, but Apple managed to deal with most of the problems and lack of data and accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you prefer the good ol' Google Maps, it is available for free in the App Store and is on par with its Android version. You get voice navigation where available, offline map caching, Street View, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>App Store now has automatic updates, nearby apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iOS App Store is still the richest application store to date. It uses a tabbed interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A Featured pages with a carousel showing the top apps is available as well as the usual Charts (Top Paid, Free and Grossing apps), Search and Updates. The Nearby apps tab will help you find the most popular apps people have downloaded in your current location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 7 brought one more feature that users have been asking for - automatic app updates. Once you turn it on in the App Store settings, your apps will update automatically (via Wi-Fi only) and you'll get notifications for the completed updates in the notification center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you decide to enable the automatic app updates, the relevant tab in the AppStore will display a list of all recent updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual you can view all the apps you've bought on your current or previous iDevice through the Purchased menu in the Update tab. iCloud plays a key part here - all of your purchased apps from each device show up and are ready for download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App Store has a new hidden extra that will be appreciated by those using iTunes gift cards. You can now scan the card codes with you camera right in the App Store interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iTunes store is where you get music, videos, TV shows, movies, podcasts and ringtones. The tabbed interface is similar to that of the AppStore, divided into Music, Movies, Search, Tones and More.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music sync is probably the trickiest part of the iCloud sync. Along with the tracks purchased from the iTunes store you surely have a collection of your own that you sync with your iOS device via iTunes. Apple is also offering a service to sync both collections in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music you've purchased at the iTunes Store will be easy to sync automatically across all your iGadgets. But you will need to use the iTunes Match service for the rest of your music collection if you want it synced too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes Match will scan your collection on the computer and check for matches with songs in the Apple's iTunes Store. If there is a match, the iTunes song will be synced, if not - well, Apple will upload this song on their servers and then sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So iTunes scans yours songs and pushes them to all your other devices if they match. If some of your tracks are of lower bitrate than 256Kbps, the iTunes Store will replace them with higher quality (256Kbps). The iTunes Match service costs $25(US) or ?25(EU) a year.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Game Center gets a new look<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Honestly, the Game Center has always looked awful, but in iOS 7 Apple finally did something about it. We are rather fond of the new look of the app, which is in line with the rest of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as functionality is concerned, the Game Center has remained pretty much unchanged - it has your games, your friends and your challenges.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last year saw two 9.7" iPads announced, but the difference between them was insignificant - the iPad 4 only drew people who were late to buy the iPad 3. The Apple iPad Air (the fifth model in the line) is a major upgrade over the previous models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the first iPad to change the design (aside from the varying thickness, which was really more a function of the battery capacity) and while we think Apple could have shaved off a few more millimeters of the side bezels, the Air is easier to hold in hand. Not quite there for single-handed use, but still a worthwhile update. Especially when you consider the thickness, both the iPad 3 and 4 were fairly chunky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is an improvement even if the most commonly quoted specs - size and resolution - haven't changed. The chipset has improved as well, even though once again the usual specs (core count and frequency) remain the same. This is why Apple doesn't like quoting specs - they may appear the same to the layman, while delivering big jumps in user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And user experience is where the iPad rules. Android may have muscled past the iPhone with specs and features, but manufacturers still can't get the tablet experience on Android right. We still think Apple should loosen things up more - other than stuff like split-screen UI here and there, the iPad interface feels like a blown up iPhone. And there are plenty of opportunities to revamp the interface when you move from 4" to 9.7".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as viable competition goes, the iPad mini 2 is official though not yet on sale (and Apple is evasive about a specific launch date). It has a 7.9" screen with the same resolution as the Air, uses the same chipset, has the same storage options and so on. The only difference is it's a lot more compact - it's easy to use in one hand and slips right into a coat pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad mini 2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Androids may not have nailed the UX yet, but the manufacturers try to add unique features that just might draw you away from the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 edition) features a bigger S Pen and a pressure-sensitive digitizer so artists and creative types can quickly and accurately sketch their ideas on it (be it in words or graphics). The tablet also comes with a choice of powerful chipsets (Snapdragon 800 or Exynos 5420) and a screen that's sharper than the iPad's Retina display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Tablet Z has a stunningly thin 6.9mm body and it's a looker too with a distinct glass-and-metal Xperia design. Even better, it's water resistant so you don't have to worry about it too much in the kitchen or near the pool. The chipset is from 2012, though the real-world difference between it and the latest chips is hard to spot most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Tablet Z Wi-Fi</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus went in another direction - its Transformer Pad TF701T is the latest in the series of Android-powered hybrids. The form factor is becoming popular with Windows 8 - an ultrabook with a detachable screen that turns into a tablet - and is fairly unique in Android land. Sure, there are third-party keyboards for the iPad, but they don't work as well as the bespoke solution, which also brings a touchpad and extra battery. The Transformer Pad TF701T has a 10.1" 299ppi screen similar to that of the Note 10.1 Keep in mind that the iPhone 5s screen has 326ppi and you hold it much closer to your eyes.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Having mentioned Windows 8, the Windows 8.1 RT OS is a strong alternative too - its UI was meant to work on desktop computers and laptops too, unlike the phone-centric Android and iOS. App selection isn't as rich as the app stores of those two or the vast Windows x86 library, but it's growing and you get a proper desktop when you hook up a mouse and a keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft's own Surface 2 tablet comes with a cool magnesium build that rivals iPad's aluminum body and has a built-in kickstand (with two positions to boot). Also, there is a selection of keyboards - very thin ones (we're talking 2.75mm here), ones with proper keys (also thin enough at 5.4mm) and ones with an extra battery.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Nokia also has a Windows 8.1 RT tablet that's similar to the Surface 2. It uses a Snapdragon 800 chipset instead of Tegra 4 and it's made of polycarbonate (it's a bit more compact and a bit lighter), but it has a kickstand and its own battery-packing keyboard.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Let's be honest - the majority of iPad owners are itching to upgrade to the latest iPad, not an Android tablet or a keyboardless Windows laptop. Even more so, if they skipped number 4 in the line. The truth is that the iPad mini 2 is the real threat to the iPad Air - it's just as powerful, with a screen that's even better (though smaller) and is more compact. Pundits can see the Retina-flaunting mini outselling the Air 2:1, but it may as well be a bold prediction to make. The full-sized iPad Air will make it sweat for sure. Whatever the result, Apple looks ready to bag another win.</paragraph>
