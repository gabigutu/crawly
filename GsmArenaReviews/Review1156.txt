			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Last year LG was in pole position in the dual-core game with the Optimus 2X. It was the phone everyone looked up to, before there was a Galaxy S II and before there was an HTC Sensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There was obviously no rush this time although, to be fair, LG did announce their forthcoming flagship well on time. The Optimus 4X HD was among the headliners at the MWC in February, right next to the HTC One X. Back then, the Samsung Galaxy S3 was but a distant rumor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, LG were beaten to market by their closest rivals. A bit beyond fashionably late to the quad-core party, you can bet it doesn't want to miss out on the action. Its name is on the guest list and, if things like 4X and HD don't get them in the VIP lounge, we don't know what will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more to the Optimus 4X HD though than multiple CPU cores and a 720p screen. LG may be late but not behind. They made sure that, at least specs-wise, their quad-core flagship matches the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 4X HD is Tegra-powered just like its dual-core predecessor. It's the Tegra 3 platform this time around, adding two more cores to do the heavy lifting and an extra one to discretely handle the low-key computing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike last year's Optimus 2X, which was behind the curve on Android 2.2 Froyo, the LG 4X HD has Android ICS 4.0.3 right out of the box and the custom Optimus launcher is doing its best to offer both visual and functional improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has pulled all the stops out to design a phone that can hold up against the heaviest competition imaginable. The screen resolution and processing power are the minimum requirements for entry into the elite club. It's from then on that the contenders are trying to make a difference. It's now LG's turn to present their credentials to the discriminating user. Ready to be impressed once again?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Retail box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD comes in an extra solid cardboard box with a slip-on lid with glossy black 4X imprints. Inside you'll find the handset, a standalone charger piece with removable USB cable, a white set of headphones and two NFC tags labeled Office and Car.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's missing is a memory card, although the inbuilt storage of 16 GB is more than enough to get you started. Some extra pairs of different-size earbuds to use with the headset would've been nice but it's not a big deal. An MHL TV-out adapter is missing too - that's almost never part of the standard equipment of smartphones, at least on our side of the pond.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree hardware spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD is a large handset but, after all, size has a lot to do with whether or not you're well received in the Android big league. With virtually the same screen diagonal and overall dimensions as the main competitors, the LG 4X HD is styled to stand out and we're about to see how space-efficient and comfortable to handle it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 132.4 x 68.1 x 8.9 mm, the LG 4X HD goes strictly by the rulebook of the Flagship Club and is right on the money at 133 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 4X HD is almost entirely made of plastic, which is the logical choice considering the size of the phone and the number of antennas inside. Just like the HTC One X and the Samsung Galaxy S III, the LG 4X HD does well to fit a massive HD screen in an ultra-slim body and keeps the weight within perfectly reasonable limits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is in fact small touches and design choices that set the three Android flagships apart. The LG smartphone easily stands out with its assertive, angular styling. What LG call the prism-edged design couldn't have been more different than the subtly curved bodies of both the HTC One X and the Galaxy S III. The 4X HD has a distinctly more solid feel in the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although it weighs exactly the same as the Galaxy S III, the well-defined edges give an impression of almost tangible extra heft. The sides of the phone have a peculiar dual frame, which looks nice, but in a way compromises the secure grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the LG 4X HD is a strange mix of experiences. It makes the Samsung Galaxy S III, which is the biggest phone of the bunch, feel almost flimsy and slippery to hold. On the other hand, it doesn't even come close to the comfortable and secure feel of the polycarbonate unibody of the HTC One X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG 4X HD flaunts a 4.7" Gorilla Glass-covered screen with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels. LG call it a True-HD display and it essentially uses the same technology as the second-generation IPS LCD of the HTC One X. The 720p resolution equates to around 312 pixels per inch and the images are impressively detailed and crisp. The display of the LG 4X HD is brighter than AMOLED and uses a RGB matrix with a full set of subpixels, as opposed to the PenTile panel in AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The True-HD IPS display of the LG 4X HD is a standard-setting LCD unit. Images are pleasingly sharp and even small fonts are crisp and readable. It cannot really match the deep blacks of AMOLED and the resulting contrast, but it's doing quite well in its own division. The colors appear a little less saturated than on the HTC One X but don't look bad by any means.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glass covering the display is very reflective and it seems the screen could've been a bit closer to the surface. The sunlight legibility is below (but not by far) AMOLED standards and that was hardly a surprise. The HTC One X, which uses very similar display technology, does a little better in terms of viewing angles and outdoor performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the LG Optimus 4X HD results from our display tests. You can find more about the testing procedures over here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Above the 4.7" screen is the earpiece, along with proximity and ambient light sensors. There's a 1.3 MP front-facing camera too, although the phone doesn't natively support video calls. Another thing missing is a notification LED - both the One X and the Galaxy S III have one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped a shot of the display under a microscope - here is how the RGB matrix of the 4X HD compares to the one on HTC's One X.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus 4X HD vs One X under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen are the three capacitive controls - Back, Home and Menu - which usually stay out of the way until lit up by a tap on the screen. A dedicated setting lets you have the keys backlight always on. A bit of a surprise, the white backlight of the capacitive keys doesn't get lost against the background of our all-white 4X HD. Just the opposite, it looks quite cool, especially at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the phone there's a volume rocker, which will be hard to spot, but otherwise comfortable to locate by touch and solid on press. The right side of the Optimus 4X HD has no controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5 mm headphones jack and a secondary microphone go with the power/lock button at the top side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, we find the centrally placed microUSB port, along with the main microphone in the corner. The microUSB port allows HD TV output with the right MHL adapter. You'll also notice a tiny slit in the back panel, which is the point of entry for your nail to pull the battery cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back we see the 8 MP camera lens along with a single LED flash and a loudspeaker grille at the bottom. The back panel is the part of the phone's design we're least impressed with. The leather-like texture looks and feels cheap - and that has nothing to do with the quality of the plastic used. It just seems a bit tacky, and doesn't go too well with the glass-covered front. By comparison, the HTC One X feels special without trying too hard - which should be the right way to go about getting a premium feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the four cores inside the LG Optimus 4X HD at full blast, the phone will occasionally heat up around the LG logo at the back but it doesn't look like a major issue that will adversely affect the phone's performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoing the back panel reveals the regular-sized SIM card slot, a microSD card slot, the NFC antenna (on the back panel itself) and a powerful 2150 mAh Li-Ion battery. Nominally, it's the biggest battery to be found in a quad-core phone, although the difference to the Galaxy S III's 2100 mAh unit is negligible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What more impressive here is the new SiO+ battery technology, which has allowed LG to get up to 6% more power out of a regular-size battery pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ample juice pack allowed the LG Optimus 4X to do pretty well in our dedicated battery life test. The smartphone scored a good overall score of 40h, which means that you'd need to be charging it every other night if you use it for an hour of telephony, an hour of video playback and an hour of web browsing per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Our battery test results</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aesthetically, the LG Optimus 4X HD has almost nothing in common with its dual-core predecessor. The new trend towards huge screens and slim bodies is something we really love and we are glad LG is finally following suit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The angular shape of the Optimus 4X HD earns it a few and does well to set the LG flagship apart from its main competitors. Granted the designers didn't have perfect success in mixing different elements and balancing different influences at the back, but we generally like how the Optimus 4X HD looks and feels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, it doesn't fit in the hand as well as the curved back of the Galaxy S III, but LG has still done good job with its handling, given the size of the smartphone. And you shouldn't forget the other aspects of a phone's design and build. Unlike the One X, the LG 4X HD has a removable battery (using a new advanced technology at that) and expandable memory. These will always be advantages in our book.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's move on to software where the real difference is to be made yet again.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Optimus UI 3.0 at the front<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD is powered by Android 4.0.3 ICS with the custom Optimus UI 3.0 on top. We saw this setup in the recently-reviewed Optimus L7, but it feels much better on the snappier hardware on the LG flagship. The Koreans have treated Ice Cream Sandwich with their highly customized style but things look subtler than usual, tidy and uncluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the mostly bright color themes and the white system menus look very nice on the HD screen. Many aspects of the phone's behavior can be customized, you can go to as small detail as the capacitive key backlight and the transition between homescreen panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has thrown in some neat tweaks and enhancements and those are by no means limited to the visuals. The MediaPlex is a set of advanced video player options, while the system-wide QuickMemo integration allows phoneblet-like experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android 4.0 interface is littered with some extra little touches that really make using the UI an enjoyable experience, particularly if you've seen ICS on other devices - small tweaks that pop up here and there will surprise you with their usefulness. We'll be sure to point them out to you as we go along. Now, let's get started with a video demo of the flagship Optimus 4X HD in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has implemented a cool swipe lockscreen, which lets you see what's "underneath" as you unlock the phone. You can also place up to four shortcuts that will unlock the phone straight into an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can change the lockscreen clock style as well as the four icons at the bottom with whichever app you choose. That's how it should be done - in HTC's Sense for example, the lockscreen shortcuts always repeat the homescreen shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While we're at it, the shortcut bar at the bottom of the homescreen is one of the major changes in the Optimus UI 3.0. It can now fit up to 6 shortcuts and that's one more than what TouchWiz offers on the Samsung Galaxy S III. You don't have to use all available slots though - you can only keep the App Drawer shortcut if you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the shortcuts are always visible on any of the homescreen panes. With the exception of the app drawer shortcut, you can rearrange, delete or replace any of these with shortcuts of your choosing, even folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff to the homescreen has been updated in this version of Android. A tap and hold on a blank area of a homescreen allows you to add various customizations to your phone. The tabs along the bottom let you select the appropriate app, widget or wallpaper, which you can add to the homescreen of your choice. Gridlines will appear when you hold and drag an app or widget, allowing you to easily place it on the homescreen. Ice Cream Sandwich also allows you to resize most widgets, if you want them to take up more or less space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default you get a seven homescreens to fill up with widgets and shortcuts, but you are free to delete any that you don't need to speed up navigation. . You can also set the default homescreen to any of the panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has also enabled a ton of other customization to the the homescreen looks and behavior. There's a dedicated setting for looped homescreen scrolling and the so-called screen effect changes the transition effect between homescreen panes. The good news is the lag we saw on the Optimus L7, when scrolling over from the last (or first) homescreen, is now gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area contains one of LG's ICS customizations in the ability to rearrange the toggle buttons shown here and you can also add and remove toggles from the edit menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, if you're playing something on the music player, quick controls will show up here. You can also drag notifications to the left or right to dismiss them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager on board is of the new ICS variety, which shows you all of the currently running apps, and lets you stop them by swiping them to the left or right. It is accessed by holding down on the hardware home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer the traditional Gingerbread task manager, that is also available as an optional download in the Application Manager in the app drawer. Keep in mind, however, that this version will only be accessible from the app's icon, while a long press of the home button will still open the ICS task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer lists all your available apps and widgets, with a dedicated tab for user downloads. There is a button in the top right corner, which triggers edit mode and lets you to easily reorder and uninstall applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contextual menu, accessed from the bottom right capacitive key, gives you the option of fitting more applications on one screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has done a good job of its custom skin for Android ICS. It's nicely styled (if a little too colorful) and feature-rich abd yet quite tasteful and unobtrusive. We're impressed with the general speed of the phone too. Everything runs smooth as silk and we have no complaints regarding the quality of use. For those who still need to put a number to it, our dedicated Synthetic Benchmarks follow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks: a Tegra 3 tie with the HTC One X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Benchmark Pi is a simple single-threaded benchmark, so we know what we can expect from it. The Optimus 4X HD falls behind the Krait-powered One X (AT&amp;T) and One S, but comes close to its Cortex-A9 CPU siblings - the Galaxy S III and the One X (international).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack offers multithreaded benchmarking, making it essential for testing quad-core beasts. The Optimus 4X HD does better than the Tegra 3-based One X, but once again falls behind the Krait-based One S and AT&amp;T One X.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant is a composite benchmark (it tests CPU, GPU and I/O). The LG Optimus 4X HD scored the same as the HTC One X, but was outrun by the One S, AT&amp;T's One X and the Galaxy S III, which topped this chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 4X HD uses NVIDIA's ULP GeForce GPU. It has a 720p screen to fill with pixels, so we were curious to find out how it fares.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NenaMark 2 shows better performance compared to the Tegra 3-powered One X, but falls behind the Galaxy S III and the US version of the HTC One X.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GLBenchmark is available on iOS devices too, so it can give us some idea of how the Optimus 4X HD compares to the PowerVR SGX 543 GPUs. We're using the Egypt test in offscreen 720p mode so that results are directly comparable even though each device has a different screen resolution.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark Egypt (offscreen 720p)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPU is obviously as good as the other Tegra 3 contender - the international One X and the best-selling Galaxy S II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider is a JavaScript benchmark and as such isn't strongly affected by the number of CPU cores - it mostly reflects the raw performance of a single core and how optimized the JavaScript engine itself is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark adds HTML to the equation - behind the scenes JavaScript computing won't do much if the web page can't update fast and smooth. The Optimus 4X HD easily takes the second place in the chart, beaten only by the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook on Ice Cream Sandwich has, for the most part, very similar functionality to that found on previous Gingerbread iterations. It has a tabbed interface, in which the central tab lists all contacts alphabetically. Contact images, where available, are displayed and there's a quick alphabet scroll on the right. There's also a regular search bar on top of the contacts list. The other tabs are Groups and Favs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filters keep the phonebook from getting messy - you can choose which groups are displayed and which are hidden (e.g. Family, email contacts, Twitter contacts and so on). The list can be sorted by first or last name and you can choose how contacts are displayed - First Name, Last Name or the opposite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a contact photo brings up the quick contacts keys. You can use them to call the contact, send them a message or email or view their profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the name of a single contact brings up their details. From here, you can edit the contact's info by hitting the pencil icon in the upper right, while the star icon on the upper right will add them to your favorite contacts. Editing a contact is pretty straightforward; you can add or remove fields as needed, as well as specify the types of phone numbers, email addresses, ringtones and even add notes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD had no trouble holding on to signal even in areas of poor coverage and the in-call audio is consistently good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dialer integrates the Call log, Contacts and Favorites, each within its own tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is clever and groups some of the calls, e.g. 3 missed calls from the same contact on the same day. A number next to the contact name shows the number of events. It's a great space saving feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dial is available and works for both numbers and names. Only one matching contact is displayed, but if you tap the down arrow button, the rest show up as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call you can pop-up the dialer should you need to dial another number. Also you can use the phone while on a call, just hit the menu key and a small green line replaces the notification area and acts like a shortcut back to the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the LG Optimus 4X. It scored a Good result, so you probably won't be missing many calls with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X can handle all common message types: SMS, MMS and email. Email capability is excellent with support for Exchange available out of box, and social media buffs will be pleased with the level of SNS integration as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extended Gmail features include batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted, spam report and of course conversation-style email view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The generic email client supports multiple accounts, and operates in much the same fashion as the Gmail one. If you add multiple accounts, then the Combined Inbox feature will come in handy, although there's no conversation-style view like in Gmail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY, Swype, voice and handwriting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD offers a standard QWERTY keyboard, which features both portrait and landscape typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of speed and accuracy are commendable in both portrait and landscape. There's a dedicated setting that enables keypress vibrations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is Swype-like input as well, though it's somewhat uncomfortably out of sight in the Input Language submenu. You need to enable Shape Writer instead of the standard QWERTY layout in the settings. Voice input is enabled too, as well as handwriting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Straightforward gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 4X HD uses the standard Android ICS gallery. It automatically locates images and videos no matter where they are stored. By default, images are sorted by albums, but you can sort by location or time as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different sets are tiled neatly across the screen, and opening the contents of a group of photos causes them to transition into the same grids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once selected, you can view an image close up by pinch zooming or double tapping on the desired area. There is a sliding gallery along the bottom which allows you to quickly browse other images in the album. On the top there are three shortcuts for quickly sharing, editing or deleting the selected photo. There are plenty of editing options available, ranging from photo effects to cropping and rotation to red eye removal. The Share feature offers quick sharing via Email, Google+, Picasa, Memo, MMS, SmartShare, Social+ or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery app displays images in full resolution. Zooming and panning is fast and smooth and there's little to no lag when doing it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A music player to like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music looks similar to the typical ICS version we're all familiar with. It can do the usual filtering by album and artist and you have alphabet search and regular search for finding songs quicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip songs back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a search menu, if you need to look up the title, artist or the album. After that you can pick where to search - your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are equalizer presets which become available when you plug in a pair of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're playing a song it also gets displayed in the notification area, where you can pause and change tracks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>No RDS for the FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio on the LG Optimus 4X HD, which can play over a set of headphones or the loudspeaker, but the headphones need to be plugged-in either way (they act as an antenna). You can also scan for radio stations, and save up to 48 channel presets. There is no RDS support though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Disappointingly poor audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the LG Optimus 4X HD audio output turned out pretty bad and is nowhere near what you would expect from flagship smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even when connected to active external amplifier the LG Optimus 4X HD could only achieve mediocre scores on most readings with the good frequency response and stereo crosstalk the only exceptions. The volume levels were way below average, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture didn't really change when we plugged in a pair of headphones. Even more distortion crept in, the stereo crosstalk worsened (although not by too much) and most of the other readings were affected too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD overall results are so bad that they made us suspect our review unit had some issue. We'll try and get another unit and repeat the test and we'll update this article if necessary.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The video player has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player has a fairly simple interface, giving you just a list (with thumbs) of all the videos on the device. There's an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can of course play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated either, yet it's quite powerful - in fact the video player was the focal point of most of the custom features developed for the LG Optimus 4X HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get the basics out of the way, the available controls during playback include a scrubber for jumping to various parts of the video along with the standard play/pause and skip buttons. There's a Dolby Mobile toggle as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new additions is a Video Speed control (you can set values from 0.5x up to 2x). A feature called Fingertip Seek lets you jump back and forward to specific parts of the video. Previews of video frames are displayed without interrupting the actual playback. There's a lock button too, which hides all controls for pure full-screen viewing. Another new feature in the video player is Live Zooming. You can zoom in (with a pinch) during actual playback and we mean some serious zoom length, not just a quick resize or fit to screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is not where the new video player perks end. An arrow on the left (in landscape) pulls a mini drawer with all the available videos. It takes half of the screen, with the currently playing video still running in the other half. You can click on any of the small thumbs and the video will play in its tiny window, giving you a live preview of sorts with the main video also running. This is LG's reply to the live video thumbnails in the Samsung Galaxy S III's gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD handled everything we threw at it - DivX, XviD, MKV and MP4/MOV up to, and including, 1080p resolution. The AC3 audio codec (among lots of others) is supported, so you don't have to worry about the sound either. There are no limitations for the bitrate, file size, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles (both Latin and non-Latin) are supported with settings for font, color, font and size. You can toggle subtitles on and off, but there's no option to manually point to a subtitle file, so the subtitle filename has to match the video filename.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD comes with an 8 megapixel camera, capable of capturing 3264 x 2448 resolution images. There is a single LED flash, but it won't be of much help in most low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the user interface to be quite convenient, though many of the important settings are inside the extended settings menu, so they take a while to toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While there is no hardwired shutter key, pressing the volume rocker will snap a photo. It's not such a good idea though. First, the volume keys don't obviously have half press and second, it's hard to comfortably hold such a slim phone. Of course, there's the virtual on-screen shutter button as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can naturally change the resolution, ISO, white balance, focus mode (auto, face-tracking), shot mode (normal, continuous shot, panorama or HDR), geo-tagging on/off, preset scenes, color effects and brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Optimus 4X HD is doing well without being overly impressive. The produced photos have plenty of detail and accurate colors, but the noise levels are slightly high and there are some visible artifacts caused by the excessive sharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few shots we've taken with the LG Optimus 4X HD.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD joins the long list of tested devices in our photo comparison tool. The page of the tool has information on how to use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The synthetic resolution chart shows the Optimus 4X HD as a better performer than the HTC One X, but it's a tab behind the Galaxy S II.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 1080p video recording ruined by the auto-focus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 4X's camera is capable of shooting 1080p videos at 30fps. Their quality is quite good the phone can simultaneously take photos while shooting a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder has fewer settings than the still camera and the one that really matters here is absent. There is no way to change the focus mode - it's always set to continuous. Unfortunately, the phone is constantly trying to refocus, which looks pretty bad on the videos and means that large parts of the clips will be blurry. To make matters worse, there's quite notable focus breathing, which makes it look like you are constantly zooming in and out as the focus readjusts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end result is just awful, as you can see for yourselves in the samples below. LG need a fix for this immediately, as the camcorder is barely usable right now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The encouraging part is that the small parts of the video that actually come on focus have a reasonable amount of detail, nice colors and are pretty smooth. This means that once LG get round to fixing the focus algorithm, the Optimus 4X HD should turn into a pretty capable camcorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video sample we've uploaded on YouTube. Don't forget to switch to 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched 1080p@30fps and 720p@30fps video samples taken with the Optimus 4X HD.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In our video comparison tool, the Optimus 4X HD didn't quite manage to match the HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S III performance in either good or bad lighting. The differences aren't huge, though, and they might not even matter for some users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD comes with a wide range of connectivity options. It has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE for global roaming and three-band HSDPA with 21 Mbps of download and 5.76 Mbps of upload. Wi-Fi is dual-band with a/b/g/n support, DLNA, Wi-Fi Direct and Hotspot capabilities. There is NFC and Bluetooth 4.0 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SmartShare is an app that lets you control a DLNA network - you can play media from other devices (e.g. NAS) on your phone or play something from the phone onto another device (e.g. a DLNA-enabled TV).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi Direct is a technology which enables devices to connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty of it is in that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to an eventual Bluetooth demise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board in the form of a dedicated app called LG Tag+. From there you can create, read and send NFC tags. With NFC you can share contacts, URLs, memos, messages, calendar events or even a call request to another NFC-enabled device or a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also store information, a profile preset or some action in a blank tag and then use it to make the phone perform an action every time you touch it - for instance launch a SatNav app when you touch the in-car tag or change your ringing profile when you touch your designated tag at the office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last connectivity option worth noting is the 3.5mm audio jack on top of the Optimus 4X.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface is completely minimalist (it's the Google way). All you get on the screen is an address bar on top and a control bar at the bottom (with options hidden by default). The address bar is placed on top of the page, so scrolling down moves it out of view. The bottom control bar houses the back and forward keys, zoom shortcut, and the new window and bookmarks keys. We recommend turning off the auto-hide option, since the placement of the capacitive home key makes it almost impossible to hit the pop-up shortcut without accidentally tapping onto the home key area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser offers the ability to save a cached copy of any page you're currently browsing onto your phone. If you choose a website and go to 'save for offline reading', you can then open it from the Saved section of your bookmarks, even when you're no longer connected to the internet. This is great for long articles, as you can save them for those times when you don't have web access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 4X HD supports double tap zoom and pinch zoom. There's text reflow too - it adjusts the columns of text to fit the screen width. If you've pinched to zoom in, you need to double tap the screen to make the browser reflow the text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Find on page, always request desktop site and brightness options are available from the advanced menu. If you tap and hold on some text you get the usual markers and select/copy/find/web search/share options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a history section in addition to the Saved pages list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The powerful quad-core hardware enables the Optimus 4X HD browser to play 1080p Flash video without a hitch. That was truly impressive stuff considering a lot of netbooks would choke on something like that. You can play touch-optimized Flash without breaking a sweat too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 4X HD comes with the usual set of organizing apps and there's a preloaded document viewer and editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is Polaris Office and it's one of the most advanced mobile editors we've seen. You can of course view documents - Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents and PDF files too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit mode offers almost a full set of options - text style, justification, paragraph formatting, bullets, even creating tables. If you're editing an Excel file, you get a formula wizard, resize rows/columns, border style, merge cells and so on. Even creating a full PowerPoint presentation is possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also doubles as a file manager and integrates with Box.net.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar app has been completely renewed. The screen estate has been split into two parts - one for the calendar and one for the agenda/daily/weekly view. This way you will always have your monthly view visible. The border line between the two sections is not fixed and you can easily move it. You can hide the monthly view completely, but you can't do the same with the other section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to enjoy the calendar in full screen without any additional views, just turn the phone landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder. You can also view events from three different calendars: your phone, your email and Google groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. The Timer, World Clock and Stopwatch features are also part of this app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a useful voice recorder and a nicely touch-optimized calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app allows you to take notes and add media to them, such as images, audio, or location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called QuickMemo function is integrated in the phone's OS, allowing you to capture screen shots of anything (including the lockscreen!) and scribble notes over them like you would on the Galaxy Note - and of course the LG Optimus Vu. A simultaneous press of the up and down buttons of the volume rocker will take the screen shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also weather, news and finance apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Social integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are no dedicated Facebook, Twitter or MySpace apps preinstalled. Luckily, the Social+ widget is here, along with the Facebook and Twitter contact sync. Once properly configured, the Social+ widget will show your Facebook news feed and Twitter updates, the latest Twitter mentions and your social messages. The gallery has Social+ integration so you can easily share photos onto Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus 4X HD does come with the Google+ and Messenger apps. Google+ lets you view trending profiles, as well as feeds from all your circles, while the messenger app lets you quickly chat with any of your Google+ contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, while they do not come with the phone, you can always download the official Facebook and Twitter apps from the app marketplace.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play app market, previously known as the Android Market, lets you download various apps for your device. Upon launch of the Market app you're greeted with the tiled interface of the Featured window. A swipe to the right takes you to the Categories view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the left takes you through Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). New sections are available such as Staff Picks, Editor's Choice and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Downloads are easy and won't take more than a couple of seconds. Before you agree to download an app, the Market will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.). You can also see if updates are available for your currently installed apps by going to My Apps in the contextual menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG SmartWorld app store is also on board. It's similar to the SamsungApps market - there you can find lots of free content and promotions exclusive for LG users.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD managed to get a GPS lock in about two minutes without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app now lets you cache maps and will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD couldn't repeat the feat of its dual-core predecessor, which had the spotlight all to itself for a good few months last year. Yet, it may turn out more fortunate than the Optimus 2X. The first dual-core phone made a reasonably big splash but failed to capitalize on its head start. The Optimus 2X had its flaws, but its main problem was being unable to live up to expectations - which in hindsight weren't very realistic to be honest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus 4X HD on the other hand comes to a more mature market, which already knows what to expect from quad-core powerhouses. It doesn't feel as rushed as its predecessor either - this time it was clearly LG's goal to finesse the experience, rather than put another first on their resume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flip side of the coin is that when you come to the market last of the big players, you need to offer something extra to convince everyone that the wait was worth it. And that's where it gets really interesting, as LG didn't take the conventional approach. Normally, you'd expect late arrivals on the market to be more expensive, and to carry more value-adding features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Koreans chose to do instead is focus on the essentials, not the fine details. They have managed to deliver a really solid smartphone with no weak points at an attractive price point. Yes, the Optimus 4X has the latest in processing power and screen quality, but it still costs less than its direct competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And before we rush to any conclusions, a look at one potential competitor, which was announced at the same time as the Optimus 4X HD, will tell us enough about how "easy" it was for LG to take the easy option. By the looks of it, the release of the Huawei Ascend D quad will be pushed further back and we may not even see it before the end of the summer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Huawei Ascend D quad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, that narrows down an already short list of rivals. And we all know who's on top of that list. The Samsung Galaxy S III is currently the smartphone to beat. Powered by Samsung's own chipset and using the company's own R&amp;D in screen technology, the Galaxy S III also boasts a rich package of exclusive software extras. What the LG 4X HD has in its favor is an equally compelling overall experience at a lower price. Matching the Samsung flagship spec for spec is out of the question, but LG's customizations and extra equipment aren't bad either for the most part.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tegra 3-based HTC One X will inevitably be the ultimate point of reference and this one is too close to call in terms of processing power and screen quality. It will be other, seemingly less tangible aspects, that will tip the scales one way or another. The Sense UI is considered the standard-setter in customizing Android but LG have just shown us that they can do equally well. It may be surprising to some, but the Optimus UI actually does some things better. The HTC One X is visually more attractive while the expandable memory and user-replaceable battery are definite points in favor of the LG 4X HD. And once again, so is the current asking price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Android has its own three-horse-race. With the opposing forces so evenly matched, it will be up to the smallest details to break the deadlock. And yes, small things can make a big difference for the individual user - things like design and feel, advanced software features and even interface customizations. There's nothing major though that divides the Big Three. It seems the Optimus 4X HD has little in the way of bangs and whistles but the overall experience is uncompromised. At this point, the order of appearance is becoming irrelevant.</paragraph>
