			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a refreshed design and software, the candy-colored Nokia Asha 501 turns a new page for the Finnish feature-phone lineup. Low-end Android smartphones continue to be the main target but, for the first time the Ashas, which Nokia has always insisted on calling smart, are walking the walk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No more of the cheap gloss of the older generations, the hardware call keys are gone too - the styling is simple but finally looks relevant and up-to-date. Touchscreen is in charge and the single Back key under the display is a major feature of the new look and feel - even if it plays a very small part in the actual navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 501 is premiering the Asha platform 1.0 - the redesigned interface is heavily swipe-driven - a trend that goes back to the previous Asha generation, but with the right bit of polish and fluency.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 501 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The version of the Nokia Asha 501 we have for this quick hands-on is the one with dual-SIM support. There's no side-mounted SIM compartment this time around, but there's still a hot-swappable SIM and a dedicated SIM manager that can remember the settings for up to five cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Long battery life, Wi-Fi, a reasonably stocked app store and exchangeable covers make this a compelling package, and a very affordable one at that. It's a nice little phone that looks fresh both on the outside and inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the Nokia Asha 501 is getting ready to hit the shelves in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America, we're about to look at that Lumia-inspired shell and the MeeGo-like interface, and see what makes it tick. Join us after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 501 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 501 is a sweetly compact device at 99.2 x 58 x 12.1 mm that weighs just under 100 g. It's a pleasure to handle - it was almost a novel experience after those big (or just plain huge) phones we've been dealing with lately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's design and build of the Nokia Asha 501 has got little to do with older Asha generations. And we mean that in all the good ways possible. The phone manages to make an impression with its colorful outer shell. The back cover that folds around the inner body comes in a candy-box variety of colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Up front, the 3" screen has an ample bezel around it but that's nothing out of the ordinary in the price bracket. The bigger problem is that the black front is a bit at odds with the bright-colored rear. On a positive note, the capacitive touchscreen is quite responsive and comes with a scratch-resistant coating. The hardware Back button is the only control below the screen, the earpiece symmetrically placed across. The microphone is in the bottom right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no brightness sensor but Nokia has included a proximity sensor, which turns the screen off during a call. The back button is pleasingly firm and springy, slightly raised above the surrounding glass surface and therefore easy to locate by touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 essentially breaks down to two parts, which is obviously the second most solid construction after unibody. The colorful shell folds around the inner body, resulting in a slim colorful frame around the screen as an accent. At the back we find the 3.15 MP camera lens along with a Nokia logo and a nub at the bottom to push the phone out of the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic used is nice to the touch, with a soft matte finish that completely rules out fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, we quite like the Asha 501's design. The phone is extra pleasant to hold and work with. What we're most impressed with is how such a simple design makes a huge difference compared to the older Asha generation. The Lumia influence is easily spotted - a great way to update an old, stale look while providing consistency and continuity in the Nokia portfolio - from feature phones to smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eye-popping colors also add to the fresh feel of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has managed to perfectly balance materials and finish, battery life, Dual-SIM support and costs. The Asha 501 is a perfect mix of affordable and portable, but also good-looking and up-to-date.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display on the Nokia Asha 501 is a 3" TFT unit of QVGA (240 x 320) resolution, which boils down to around 133ppi. The screen is capacitive and has multi-touch support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are nice and punchy and the screen is reasonably bright. Size may be an issue, as well as resolution, but the responsiveness has been notably improved from what we remember with the older Asha phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the web and watching videos isn't the most compelling experience on a screen of that screen size and resolution of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the stats - contrast levels are pretty good but the brightness isn't all that impressive on paper. Blacks are good too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is standard RGB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find all about our display testing routines here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 501 features a power button on the right side, which will also lock and unlock the device, although you can do without it as the phone can be nudged out of standby with a double tap on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker sits comfortably in the upper right corner of the phone. All three buttons (power and volume) are solid to press and easy to locate by touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Nokia Asha 501 doesn't hold any controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's the microUSB port, along with an old-gen Nokia charging port and a 3.5 mm headphones jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom holds no controls whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoing the back cover is easy - a light push on the nub at the bottom will do and the phone's bottom part will pop out of the shell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can then go on and take the phone out. Doing so reveals the 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery, with the primary SIM card slot under it in the very battery compartment. The hot-swappable microSD and secondary SIM card slot are on the side. This actually means they could've been accessible on the outside too but Nokia went for exchangeable covers instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery on the Asha 501 is quoted at 624 hours of stand-by and 17 hours of calls for the dual-SIM version and almost double the standby time for the single-SIM variant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had the Nokia Asha 501 sitting around for a couple of days before we started actually testing it - making calls on both SIM cards, taking pictures, browsing the web, listening to music and checking out most of the available options and apps - and we managed to get the battery down to about 30%.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Updated Asha Touch takes after MeeGo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia's Asha Touch user interface has been known to heavily borrow from MeeGo, but the new Asha generation has really lost any decency - who can blame them really, it's a debt that will never have to be repaid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To Nokia's credit, it's done a pretty good job of porting stuff to the lesser hardware. We're as happy with the new interface as we are with the fresh styling of the handset. Scrolling and, rarely, swiping do feel a bit choppy but other than that it's a good-looking interface with a modern feel to it - a significant improvement over the Ashas of old.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the styling of the icons has barely changed but wallpapers are a welcome addition that gives some punch to the interface - along with much needed depth. When you scroll or swipe, the background responds too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting rid of the hardware call buttons is another step towards a decisively modern look. The single hardware control is actually a Back key, and it is only really needed when you need to go a level up from a submenu. For everything else, swipes and taps will do. A double tap will wake the phone up, swiping an app off the screen will close it. We told you, the whole thing is modeled after MeeGo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the usual video demo to get us started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen doesn't have any active shortcuts to directly launch apps but it will display notifications for missed calls, incoming messages or calendar events. These will take you right to the relevant app, be it the dialer, calendar or messaging. A tiny number icon on the Messaging icon in the app launcher shows the text messages you have received but not yet read. That works for email too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A double tap will nudge the phone out of standby and display the lockscreen - you need to enable the option in the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the preceding Asha Touch version, the interface was built around a three-homescreen setup: the app launcher, the phone app (or Radio, or Music Player) and a pane to fill with app shortcuts or favorite contacts. There're only two homescreens now - the app launcher and the so-called Fastlane. It's a similar setup to What Windows Phone does with the Tile screen and All Apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Fastlane keeps track of all your recent activity, opened apps go there, along with contacts you've called, calendar events (birthdays, to-dos) and social network posts and gonigs-on. Not all apps are available in the Fastlane - the Settings, Browser and Camera, among others, didn't appear in the recently opened list - Alarms, Facebook and Gallery do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player will appear in the Fastlane only if you've played a track - that makes sense really. What you get is a line with the track name, tap on which will take you to the Music Player app. Alternatively, a tiny play/pause button next to the track name, will simply resume or pause playback without going into the app itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the action happens on the touchscreen. There's a single hardware button that's directly involved in navigating the interface. The Back key's only job is to get you back a level up from a submenu - of course it can close apps too and bring you to the homescreen - but there's a better way of doing that - just swipe the app off screen to close it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is this time a bigger 4 x 4 grid, up from 3 x 4. All the apps you install reside here and you can rearrange them as you see fit but you cannot create folders. A tap and hold inside the app launcher triggers edit mode, where you can delete apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap to expand the status bar or pull it down to show notifications for missed events and quick toggles for sound profiles and mobile data. There are shortcuts too to the music player, the phone and messaging apps. The two SIM cards have their icons in the notification area with the network ID and the custom names you gave each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case of a missed call, which requires your attention, the notification area drops down a bit to briefly display the number and then pulls back up, leaving a small handle as a reminder, which you can pull to see who's been calling you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To close an app you just need to swipe it away from either end of the screen and you'll be back to the app launcher screen. You can also close apps by holding the Back button but for some apps you'll get a prompt to confirm you want to close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some apps give you a context menu, which is accessible via a swipe from the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu is a vertically scrollable list of settings, which is easy enough to navigate. The first options are connections, which lists Flight mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the SIM menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next menu handles Personalization - it lists the options for sounds and wallpapers. Glance screen is an option for the lockscreen, which displays a permanent clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the SIM menu you can enable Mobile data, check out the counters for call times and data packages. You can also choose a new name for either SIM, select Fixed dialing, change PIN and Network selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface runs reasonably fast and is easy enough to navigate but could've been smoother - scrolling animations could certainly use a higher framerate. Once you get a feel for the swipe navigation there's really no way to go wrong. Even if you open an app by mistake it's only a swipe from either edge of the screen to close it and get back to first base. The notification area comes in handy for toggling quick settings like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and spares you the need to open up the settings menu. Recently opened apps are just a swipe away in the Fastlane.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM telephony works fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phone app of the Asha 501 is pretty straightforward and works well. In the new Asha touch interface it integrates with the Call log and the Dialer and that's more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are displayed with a photo and number, and a swipe up from the bottom of the actual list you get the Advanced menu and Add new contact shortcut. Then comes the search field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual contact details are displayed on a completely redesigned screen. You get a faded contact's picture as a background, with a huge name across and a number below. A few big thumbable icons at the bottom of the screen let you call, text or email the person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add various details to your contacts, like numbers, mail address, ringtone or a URL. You can also choose where to save your contacts - SIM 1, SIM 2 or the phone memory. Only two sorting options are available - by first or last name. Contacts can be copied, moved or deleted either individually or in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is pretty standard, but sadly it doesn't offer smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you're about to place a call you're prompted to choose the SIM card to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both SIMs are active at the same time and you can receive calls on either line - the ongoing call is put on hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The in-call screen shows options for the keypad, muting a call, putting it on speaker, holding it and entering contacts. If you leave the in-call screen the status bar will notify you of an ongoing call and within a tap on it you'll be back to the Dialer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reception with the Asha 501 was consistently good and in-call sound was loud and surprisingly clear.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player and gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 501's music player has a neat interface and starts up with album art on top of the available sorting options: songs, artists, albums and playlists. There's no folder view and no additional settings for sound, such as an equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing screen shows the timeline, album art, track and artist name, along with four toggles - skip, FF, play/pause and a home icon which takes you back to the start screen. The now playing screen features a pull-up context menu from the bottom of the screen, which gives you options to fav a song, shuffle, repeat and share.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The song will keep playing even if you exit the player - you get a shortcut in the Fastlane and on the lockscreen with play-pause-skip controls readily available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Asha 501 has two tabs - the all captured tab, which holds all the images and videos you've captured with the Asha 501 and the folder view, which gives you the captured, favorites, modified and received.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are shown in a grid of three and are scrollable vertically. You can pinch to zoom on images but strangely double-tap doesn't work here. You can share photos via email or Bluetooth and edit them. Editing options include rotating, flipping, cropping, lighting and contrast adjustment and adding color effects. The edited images go into the Modified folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set images as wallpapers, add them to favorites, see details and start a slideshow from the pull-up context menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Files is a great file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia has a long tradition of great file managers on S40 and Symbian, which the Asha 501 continues. The app has a very clean interface and first lets you select between phone memory and the SD card. You can mass copy, delete and move items and folders, create new folders and sort by name, size, newest and oldest.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>3.15 fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 has a 3.15 MP camera which is capable of capturing images of up to 2048 x 1536 resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is simple - it offers a virtual on-screen shutter, a toggle for switching between camera and camcorder and a gallery shortcut. Upon a tap you get a zoom slider and the additional settings option. There you'll find adjustable white balance, self-timer, live effects and shutter sound, which can be disabled too. You can also preset the resolution of the images with a choice between 3MP, 2MP, 1MP and VGA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the specs suggest, images produced by the Asha 501 aren't anything worth writing home about but they will do for the occasional visual memo or contact picture. There isn't too much of fine detail, which should hardly surprise anyone, but the colors are nicely punchy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the samples.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QVGA video at 15 fps fails to impress<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to video capture, the Asha 501 was way out of its depth. The camera can produce QVGA (240 x 320) videos with a framerate of 14fps. Sound is recorded in mono at 31Kbps and a sampling rate of 16kHz, the video bitrate hovers around 400 Kbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can tell, those videos are hardly good for anything and we can't see anyone actually using their Asha 501 for video capture. Still if you are interested in the results you might check out this untouched QVGA@15fps sample video.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data-efficient browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 has Wi-Fi, but sadly no 3G data speeds. Still, the Nokia Xperss browser uses server compression so it offers a passable experience on EDGEnetworks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's tabbed browsing and you can save favorite websites as tiles in an Opera-like speed dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a neat start page with categories such as Featured, Mail, Sports, Social Networks, Entertainment, etc. The pull-up context menu gives you quick access to recent, favorites, downloads, web apps and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings of the browser let you choose the quality of the preloaded images, from lower to best quality. Images can be disabled altogether too. There's a password manager as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browsing experience isn't spectacular on the Asha 501. Pages load reasonably fast but don't look their best on the tiny 3-incher of QVGA resolution. Still, the Asha 501 will certainly let you check the score of your favorite team's last game or browse through the news websites.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 501 is a fun little device that 's quick to catch the eye with an assortment of vibrant paint jobs. This is a decisively refreshed and up-to-date look for the series and the interface has been remodeled accordingly. We liked the fact that the new Asha Touch UI is involves many more gestures than before. The phone is intuitive to use and extremely friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Asha generation does not only build on its predecessors but is trying to set itself apart aesthetically. The Asha 501 does so convincingly - the design is more akin to the Lumia 520 than to the cheap gloss of the older Ashas. The refreshed user interface is an important part of that too. Nokia's insistence on calling the Asha series smart bordered on embarrassing but it finally looks like the Finns may have a point after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Asha 501</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 is a notch below last year's top dog in the lineup, the Asha 311 but you wouldn't know by looking or using the two phones. The one we got for this preview is the Dual-SIM version of the handset, and the only thing to be held against is the lack of a side-mounted SIM slot, which is a Nokia staple. The good looks and quality build more than make up for that though. And by the way, you can still hot-swap SIM cards, so it's not all bad. The microSD card (4GB in the bundle) and Wi-Fi connectivity are nice things to have in this price range, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 501 might be one of the last representatives of a dying breed and is given the task to buy more time for the WP strategy to work out, rather than lay foundations for a lineup that is aiming to dominate the market one day. Nonetheless, it's a very credible package - good-looking, durable and well-behaved. We'd gladly take it for another spin and will be keeping an eye on the Ashas to come. There's definitely good value to be had there.</paragraph>
