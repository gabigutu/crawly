			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The flagship Android segment has always been a battlefield but you wouldn't want to be around when these two are in their most violent mood. The Samsung Galaxy S5 and Sony Xperia Z2 are two of the most advanced smartphones to ever sit on a store shelf. Both make big claims regarding screens and cameras (staples for both companies) and brag about practically each of their features. And to say that it's a long list would be a massive understatement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is in its prime, in large part due to the enormous commercial success of its phones. Sony is ailing and cutting off businesses to focus more tightly on its core competencies, especially smartphones. The outcome of this matchup will have a great impact on the fates of the two tech giants.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick blow by blow of where each phone bests its opponent. Keep in mind those differences are on paper only and the advantage might shift from one side to the other in the actual tests.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xperia Z2 over Galaxy S5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony and Samsung are competing in the camera market - from point-and-shoot through mirrorless to DSLR - so of course they put their own sensors in their flagship phones. Smartphones have been outselling traditional cameras for years now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two companies are also among the biggest TV makers and some of the biggest display makers for screens big and small. You can bet your bottom dollar their flagship phones are going to serve as a promotion of the two respective screen business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony made water resistance a trademark for the flagship Xperia devices, but this year Samsung jumped on it too after dabbling with Xcover and Active devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One way or another, flagship smartphones have become the calling cards, pocket-sized posters of the companies that make them. With good reason too, no other digital segment sells in the hundreds of millions units and keeps growing year after year. In fact, cameras, TVs even computers are in decline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So it should come as no surprise that the two tech giants are putting on their Sunday best for the two flagships - that means the best screen, camera, chipset and other goodies they could get their hands on, plus the best design they could dream up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Going by the sentiments at popular Internet forums (including our own comment sections), the outcome of this chapter might be predetermined - Sony's OmniBalance design gets many accolades, while Samsung mostly attracts criticism even after the switch to faux leather (which looks much better than the Galaxy S III / S4 generation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the rundown. Sony's design involves an aluminum frame that's left exposed on the sides, with two slabs of scratch-resistant glass covering the entirety of the front and back. It may be a fingerprint magnet, but the Xperia Z2 is one of the most attractive devices on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's design for the Galaxy S5 calls for a Gorilla Glass front, faux perforated leather on the back and a glossy plastic frame along the sides. The back is not everyone's cup of tea, but it hides fingerprints and scratches better and it's got more grip. Plus, it's a notable improvement over the last generation Galaxy S, for what it's worth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While looks are certainly a key feature of a smartphone (it's always in your hand or on ear), there are more considerations before declaring a winner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, the Galaxy S5 is more compact and lighter. The exact measurements are 142 x 72.5 x 8.1mm and 145g for the Samsung. The Xperia Z2 measures 146.8 x 73.3 x 8.2mm and weighs 163g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Arguably the most important measurement here is width where both phones are fairly close, but the Sony will still feel bigger if you hold the two one after the other. Do keep in mind the Xperia Z2 has a slightly bigger screen, 5.2", compared to Galaxy S5's 5.1". The displays will be compared in the next chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both devices are water resistant, but Sony's is IP58 certified while the Galaxy has IP67. In case you're not familiar with IP ratings, the first digit is ingress protection (think dust) and the second is water resistance. A 5 means dust can get in causing only cosmetic damage, while a 6 means no dust can get in at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the second digit, a 7 indicates the Galaxy S5 can be submerged up to a meter of water for half an hour. With an 8, the Xperia Z2 goes further on both measurements - beyond 1m for over 30 minutes - but the exact maximum isn't specified by the standard (or Sony for that matter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind a meter of water isn't much even in pools. Neither phone will suffer from small dips, but overall there's a smaller chance you'll drown your Xperia Z2 than you will your Galaxy S5 if you go swimming, phone in pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The side keys on both devices are positioned relatively low and are easily reachable. The Sony Xperia Z2 scores some brownie points for its shutter key, even if it's not the most comfortable around. Maybe some will prefer the larger on-screen key but to us, half press is always a perk, phase detect or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of buttons, Samsung is the only major manufacturer that still uses hardware keys (even on its 12.2" tablets!). Those have their advantages, they don't waste screen space for one, and Samsung corrected the main disadvantage - having the Menu key when there's no need for it (since Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware Home key is a necessity on the Galaxy S5 since it houses a fingerprint sensor, the functions of which we'll cover in the software section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony, in turn, has been using on-screen buttons for a while. Some prefer them over hardware keys, others quite the opposite, it comes down to personal choice. The on-screen keys get out of the way in the video player and web browser but still eat up screen real estate elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a microUSB 3.0 port (more on that later), but both it and the microUSB 2.0 port on the Xperia Z2 are covered by protective flaps for the sake of water resistance. Day to day they prove to be more of a nuisance though as you have to open and close them each time you charge the phone or connect it to a PC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has a solution to the charging problem - exposed pogo pins can charge the phone even if the USB port flap is closed, but you will need to buy the special dock. Both companies offer wireless charging kits though, although Samsung's implementation is miles better - you just need to replace the back cover. The Sony Xperia Z2 on the other hand needs to be put in a special case for that to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's design is daringly angular and involves a completely flat front and back. This means the Xperia Z2 lays flat on a table, completely wobble-free. The loudspeakers doesn't get muffled either, since the phone has stereo front-facing speakers, similar to HTC's One phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has only a single loudspeaker on the back with a small nub to keep the speaker from getting completely plugged by the surface it's resting on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16MP camera lens on the Samsung is the second element on the back that protrudes causing wobble. The 20.7MP shooter on the Sony is flush with the back, but just as exposed to scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the camera on the Galaxy S5 is another element we'll leave for later, the heart rate monitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can take the back cover off to reveal a 2,800mAh battery, which can easily be swapped out. The battery in the Xperia Z2 is sealed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z2. It's more attractive - and that's not just us swaying to the popular opinion. It has better water resistance, while the physical shutter key and stereo speakers are definite assets too. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is the more compact of the two and offers a user-accessible battery. The extra sensors try to tip the scales back but fall just short.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones represent each company's screen-making expertise. Samsung put a Super AMOLED on the Galaxy S5, while Sony packed the Triluminos and X-Reality trademark features on the Xperia Z2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has a 5.1" screen of 1080p resolution and 432ppi. The diamond-pattern PenTile matrix, however, means the actual sharpness is lower than that of Sony's LCD screen. Not that you can tell even looking at them side by side, other things like color rendering, contrast and viewing angles stand out more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung took several years to perfect Super AMOLED for it to finally offer the most accurate colors in the market. Using the display mode settings you can tweak that to a more saturated look if you prefer. It has excellent viewing angles and practically infinite contrast too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has fixed the viewing angle issues plaguing its screens and the Triluminos display on the Xperia Z2 looks great. The X-Reality engine (successor to the Bravia engine) lets you tweak contrast, saturation and sharpness of images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast is excellent though the maximum brightness is actually lower than that of the Super AMOLED (typically the roles are reversed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While both screens offer great image quality indoors, the Samsung Galaxy S5 screen does noticeably better outside. The LCD on the Sony Xperia Z2 is on the reflective side, which affects legibility in direct sunlight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two screens have special tricks they can do thanks to their sensitive digitizers. We've seen Samsung's Air View, which detects your finger at about an inch distance and trigger special previews of image folders, messages and calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony goes after the Galaxy Note with the ability to use a regular pencil as a stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The accurate color rendering is great in theory, but it only matters to the few that know what sRGB is. It's the great sunlight legibility that wins the day, thanks to the less reflective and even slightly brighter Super AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 screen is slightly bigger (but you lose space due to the on-screen buttons) and sharper on some occassions, but most people don't have the eyesight to spot the difference. The drop in maximum brightness and increase in reflectivity from the Xperia Z1 hurt Sony's latest flagship.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both phones are powered by Qualcomm chipsets and enjoy all the connectivity benefits that come with it. Starting with the basics like quad-band 2G and penta-band 3G, the two flagships also enjoy the fastest mobile data around with Cat. 4 LTE (up to 150Mbps down and 50Mbps up). Without an LTE network where you are, they'll still go quite fast at 42.2Mbps down and 5.76 up courtesy of HSPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connections are blazing fast as well thanks to dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac (a/b/g/n are supported too). Bluetooth 4.0 is available for connecting with accessories including low-power devices like wearables. Both phones also support the ANT+ standard, which is popular with sports accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wired connectivity is where the two flagships start to diverge. The Samsung Galaxy S5 has a microUSB 3.0 port, which will provide faster data transfers between the phone and a computer. It also integrates MHL 2.1, which means it can, with the right adapter, output 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 has a regular microUSB 2.0 port but it takes the MHL version up to 3.0. The key difference here is that the newer standard supports 2160p video @ 30fps, just the kind you can record with the Z2's camera (you'll need a new UHD TV too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones feature NFC for use with tags and easy pairing with some devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 also has an IR blaster on top to control electronic equipment at home, including TVs, disc players and even air conditioners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. The key features - 150Mbps LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC - are evenly split.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has USB 3.0, which offers faster transfer rates for those who still use cables, and the IR blaster is great for HTPC setups though not vital.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, if you have a UHD TV then the MHL 3.0 port on the Xperia Z2 becomes more valuable as it allows you to view 2160p videos you've shot straight from the phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 goes in this chapter with a small advantage - it houses a 3,200mAh battery, compared to 2,800mAh for the Samsung Galaxy S5. That 400mAh worth of an advantage accounts for just over 14% of the total capacity but the real difference will be made by how power efficient each phone is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 sits near the top of our battery life table with a massive 89 hours of endurance rating. That's nearly four full days on a single charge. In comparison, the Galaxy S5 "only" lasts three days, with a 72 hour rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z2 isn't just a marathon runner though, it bested the Galaxy S5 in each of our three tests. It was a relatively slim victory in the call test with just under an hour more.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The decisive victory in the individual tests comes in the web browser department, where the Sony Xperia Z2 enjoys a nearly two hour lead on its rival. It lasts nearly half a day of constant browsing so even after extended web sessions you'll have plenty of battery charge left. The Galaxy S5 tried to put up a fight, but just couldn't keep up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 takes its third victory in the video playback test. The advantage here is about an hour, but if you think about it in reverse, the Z2 will be left with more charge in the battery after watching the same movie on both phones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the end, the Sony Xperia Z2 will likely last you a day longer than the Samsung Galaxy S5 in an identical use pattern. Both phones will last you through the day, but if you forget to charge your phone you can get away with it easier with the Xperia than with the Galaxy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones have power-saving modes that disable some of the phone's features to extend the time to the next charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z2. The composite endurance rating gives the Sony a solid lead but, equally important, it also managed to beat its rival in all three of the individual tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery life of the Samsung Galaxy S5 is certainly not bad, but you will need to charge it more often.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 and Sony Xperia Z2 both launch with Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box with a number of software tweaks by each parent company. As usual, Sony's skin is lighter while Samsung is typically modding stock Android head to toe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is into biometric sensors this generation and the fingerprint sensor on the Home key is a highlight. This enables a secure lockscreen that isn't based on passwords or patterns, instead you swipe a finger down the key. In case it fails (it happens when your fingers are wet, for example), then it falls back to a passcode so there's no danger of getting locked out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony stayed closer to the vanilla lockscreen, the only real change is the camera shortcut at the bottom. The Xperia Z2 lockscreen supports widgets (one per pane), while the Samsung screen only shows notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony home screen is also very vanilla - you start with 5 panes and you can add or remove panes. One Sony addition is Themes, which pack a wallpaper and matching color highlights for UI elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's homescreen looks fairly standard except the My Magazine feature replaces one of the homescreen panes. It's a news reader that will pull news and content from multiple sources in several categories and your social networking accounts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has Socialife, which is an app instead. It merges Facebook and Twitter accounts with news sources, but doesn't take up an entire homescreen pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In contrast with the minimalist lockscreen, Samsung stuffed the notification area with features. Some of them we like - the quick toggles and brightness slider are used often enough to warrant a place here. The S Finder and Quick Connect buttons are debatable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another like that pops up here is Recommended apps. It's a response to certain events, e.g. plugging in a pair of headphones brings out shortcuts for multimedia apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's notification area looks more stock but Sony did put tabs on it to separate the notifications from the toggles. The toggles themselves include some Sony additions like the Stamina mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint sensor on the Samsung Galaxy S5 isn't limited to the lockscreen - in the co-called Private mode, it secures files (photos, videos, documents) in an encrypted part of the phone's storage. They are only visible when Private mode is on, which takes a swipe of a finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor can also secure payments with PayPal. You can set up to three fingers to be recognized, so you can share the phone with someone and let them access Private mode and PayPal payments or keep those to yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For multitasking, Samsung pushes its Multi Window feature that puts two apps side by side. You can copy and paste text between them or snap a screenshot in one and use it in the other. Apps that go well together can be grouped into a single shortcut for added convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has its own multitasking feature, Small Apps. Instead of splitting the screen, Small apps live in small windows that can be moved around or minimized to a tiny icon. Like Multi Window, you need an app that specifically supports the multitasking feature, but Sony's solution can turn widgets into Small apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two approaches are not really compatible. Samsung's approach assumes both apps are equal, while Sony's has one main app and one utility app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. We know TouchWiz has its vocal detractors, but no one can deny its wealth of features and a good deal of those are pretty helpful in your day-to-day operations. The Xperia Z2 is right up there with it, but the fingerprint scanner enables an extra lockscreen option and secure storage. Multi Window is more elaborate than Small apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With both phones powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 and using 1080p screens you might think a performance test is pointless. It's not, it's just that Qualcomm's naming scheme is unclear and hides the fact that the Galaxy S5 processor is clocked at 2.5GHz, while the Xperia Z2 CPU is at 2.3GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPU clockspeeds are equal in theory, but the Sony flagship has 3GB of RAM. Since the CPU and GPU share that, the Xperia Z2 might come out ahead despite the lower processor speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slower CPU is felt in Geekbench 3 where the Samsung Galaxy S5 posts the higher score. Still, Xperia beats the HTC One (M8), which uses the same chipset (but with 2GB of RAM).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using Basemark OS II we see that the Samsung has an advantage in single-core tasks, but the difference is thinning away for multi-core loads. The overall score from the benchmark puts both phones on even ground.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu 4 tests the entire system - CPU and GPU, but also RAM and storage - and the Galaxy S5 managed to inch ahead of the Xperia Z2. The HTC One (M8) beats both phones here, but it's no secret HTC is using benchmark detection to overclock its chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With identical GPUs and screen resolution, both phones are expected to perform identically and indeed the difference between them is quite small. The Galaxy S5 wins the offscreen tests, while the Xperia Z2 takes the onscreen tests. The difference is less than 1fps however, unlikely to be noticed.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We also tried Epic Citadel in Ultra quality to see if using a different engine will make any difference - but it was negligible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel (Ultra)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 comes with Chrome out of the box, while the Galaxy S5 uses the stock browser too. As usual, Samsung has modified the stock browser (something they can't do to Chrome) to boost its performance and it beats the Z2 in both raw JavaScript performance (Kraken) and overall HTML5 speed (BrowserMark).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Tie. Going solely by benchmark numbers the Samsung Galaxy S5 narrowly won in the CPU and web tests, but the differences are too slim to notice in daily use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3GB of RAM on the Sony Xperia Z2 allow it to handle multiple apps in the background better and while it didn't increase raw performance, heavy multitaskers should still feel a difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony and Samsung have respectable camera divisions and compete in image quality but also value-added features. We'll see camera performance in the next chapter, first we'll visit the multimedia apps each company has preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both gallery apps are custom jobs and feature extensive support for online albums. Sony pushes its PlayMemories service along with Facebook, Picasa and Flickr. It features Globe and Map views, great for finding photos you snapped abroad, and a SensMe slideshow that groups similar photos together automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Gallery also supports Facebook and Picasa, plus Dropbox. While the Xperia Gallery can group photos by the people in them, Samsung took this a step further and lets you filter photos by more categories: scenery, documents, pets, food, vehicles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has deep roots in the music industry and uses the music player on the Xperia Z2 to feature its Music Unlimited store, which can also be a great tool for discovering music with Charts, New Releases and Channel categories. It can also be completely disabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player features a neat trick - the infinity button allows you to do quick lookups related to the song you're listening to. This could be finding the video on YouTube, looking for lyrics, checking out info about the artist on Wikipedia and more (it can be extended by way of plugins from the Play Store).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for audio quality settings, the Xperia Z2 features a 5-band equalizer, a Clear Bass setting, Clear Stereo (it enhances the stereo effect), ClearAudio+ (adjusts the audio settings to fit the song) and dynamic normalizer (which levels out volume differences between tracks).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're listening music on the front-facing speakers on the Z2, Clear Phase and xLOUD promise to improve the audio quality and boost the volume respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony flagship also has an FM radio with RDS and TrackID integration. Once TrackID recognizes the song, you can post an "I'm listening to..." update on Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 does not have stereo speakers or a radio, but it does have Music square to match SenseMe Playlist on the Sony. The two features build playlists automatically after you select a mood (Passionate or Joyful) and tempo (Exciting or Calm).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 uses a similar square interface to simplify picking an equalizer setting or you could do it manually with a 7-band equalizer. Adapt sound can tune the settings automatically for your headphones by playing a series of beeps to assess which frequencies work and which don't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart volume is the name of the feature that equalizes the volume between tracks and you get a number of presets from SoundAlive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video players on both phones suffer from relatively poor codec support. Notably DivX is missing, though the XviD works. Both players support MP4 and MKV files, which have overshadowed AVI in recent years - and both work fine. Unless they have multi-channel audio that is, both players pretty much only work with MP3 and AAC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones support subtitles and carry over the sound options from their music players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 has Pop Up Play, which puts the video in a small, resizable window if you want to use another app while watching video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's video player has an extra trick up its sleeve - much like the song recognition engine in the video player, it can recognize a movie and pull additional info including cast and plot summary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. By just a hair but the image gallery has more sorting and editing options and the music player is friendlier to beginners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 has FM radio and the Infinite button offers some helpful search functions, but neither is enough to topple the feature-heavy Sense.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 and Samsung Galaxy S5 both deliver excellently clean audio output worthy of their flagship status. The Samsung handset has a slight edge, which will be impossible to detect by all but the most hardcore audiophiles armed with ultra expensive headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume level difference is far easier to spot though and it's clearly in favor of the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z2 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5 frequency response</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. While the majority of users will be perfectly happy with the output of either smartphone, the Galaxy S5 manages to edge its rival in terms of both cleanness and loudness of its audio. </paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2's camera has the wider field of view (FoV) when using the entire frame, but the Superior auto mode crops photos to 16:9 aspect ratio, which levels things out with the Samsung Galaxy S5. The Galaxy has a 16:9 sensor so it doesn't have the option to shoot taller photos but, as we're about to see, you'd be better off using Superior auto with the Sony, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Superior Auto takes the 20.7MP frame from the Sony sensor, crops it to 16:9 and downscales the result to 8MP. Conveniently, that's just the resolution of a UHD TV so the photos will fit perfectly. The mode does some special post-processing along the way, which improves what are otherwise disappointing results at full resolution in Normal mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The images produced by the Xperia Z2 are very soft, most of which can be attributed to intense noise reduction. High-contrast areas like the white letters on a blue background appear like a smudgy mess even though the sensor has resolution to spare. Lower-contrast areas like the white text on yellow background are even worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is on the verge of resolving the small type, it's nearly readable. You can spot some oversharpening artifacts in that area, but it's not something you'll notice unless you view the image at 100%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP Superior Auto shots from the Sony look noticeably sharper but the lower resolution does cause some loss in detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>This crop also has the three primary colors visible - Red, Blue and Green. Neither phone hits the mark with the rendering - the contrast are a bit too much in the Galaxy S5 photo and a bit too little in the Xperia Z2 Normal mode photo. The Superior auto mode seems to be closest to the truth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 has its headaches too, it struggles with foliage. The grey roof in the center of the image also shows a clear oversharpening halo. The Sony Xperia Z2 in Superior auto renders the tree better than Normal mode though not much better than the Samsung. The fire escape in the background also improves with Superior Auto though again not enough to beat the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the full res samples, if you feel like performing your own comparisons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We moved to a dark room to try the low-light performance of both phones. This is the Xperia Z2's time to shine - it has a wider f/2.0 aperture and a larger 1/2.3" sensor, compared to Galaxy S5's f/2.2 lens and 1/2.5" sensor. The super sampling performed by Superior auto will also be of great help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first test is with the flash off. The Samsung Galaxy S5 photo was taken at 1/20s shutter speed and it has clear traces of camera shake. The Sony Xperia Z2 shot at 1/32s and the Superior auto mode in particular looks very usable. There's some noise and softness, but it looks very good for a low-light shot.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Next, we enabled the LED flashes (which only work at relatively short distances) and took more photos. The Galaxy S5 dropped the shutter speed 1/33s and eliminated the handshake, capturing a good deal of detail. The white balance is noticeably skewed towards red.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 didn't drop the shutter speed, but the quality increased slightly. Again, an LED flash really isn't effective beyond 2m / 6ft.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones also feature the recently trendy shallow depth of field effect. Both have only one camera so they take two photos and achieve the effect through software trickery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary difference here seems to be the effect's intensity. Samsung opted for slight blur, while Sony smudges the background to a near uniform blob of color. This makes the effect look cooler at first but also serves to highlight the areas where the algorithm got it wrong. Samsung's algorithm messes up some areas too, but it's less noticeable since the difference between "in focus" and "blurred" isn't as big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, check out our Photo comparison tool that pits the two phones against each other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S5 ? Sony Xperia Z2 Normal mode ? Sony Xperia Z2 Superior auto</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones offer some playful effects. The Xperia Z2 can overlay an imaginary 3D world over the photo with the AR effect (at a meager 1080p resolution) or use the GPS and compass to overlay info about your surroundings whit Info-eye. It has a dedicated Vine mode too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 lets you create Virtual tours (though you might be better off just shooting video) and packs a bundle of effects in Shot &amp; more (removing moving objects, cloning them and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. The daylight shots were clearly superior and it does relatively okay in the dark with the flash on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 underdelivers on its 20MP large-sensor promise, but 8MP Superior Auto shots look okay. The one area it won over the Samsung is low-light with flash off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since videos are shot in 16:9 mode, both phones have virtually the same field of view. The Xperia Z2 frame gets a little narrower when you go from 2160p to 1080p but it's nothing major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that both phones are limited to just 5 minutes of 2160p videos, if you need longer you'll have to settle for good old 1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MP4 containers with the AVC codec are the choice, but the Sony Xperia Z2 uses a higher framerate, 55Mbps, than the Samsung Galaxy S5, 48Mbps. It also has a higher audio bitrate, 156Kbps over 128Kbps, but we actually prefer the sound of the Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In theory, the higher bitrate should give the Xperia Z2 an advantage in terms of fine detail, but the Galaxy S5 videos actually look sharper. The contrast isn't as good (the shadows are too bright), but the Samsung did get the colors closer to reality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 1080p resolution, the bitrates even out at about 17Mbps, but the Xperia Z2 keeps the higher audio bitrate. Here the Galaxy S5 image looks better, though the margin is noticeably slimmer. By the looks of it, Sony's downsampling isn't as smooth as there are some visible jaggies in diagonal lines. Fine detail like text doesn't looks as good as in the Samsung video either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two flagships have some extra shooting modes - 1080p @ 60fps and 720p @ 120fps. The 120fps mode on the Xperia Z2 is called Time shift since it plays back at normal speed and transitions to slo-mo at a user selected point in the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S5 and Xperia Z2 also have video HDR modes too, but neither works at the highest available 2160p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S5 vs. Sony Xperia Z2 at 2160p</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung Galaxy S5 vs. Sony Xperia Z2 at 1080p</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. It offered a sharper image in both 2160p and 1080p modes, plus the audio sounded better, even if the contrast wasn't quite what we would have liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 videos are pretty good in general but loses the head to head combat at both resolutions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We won't go into detail about the phone and messaging apps, but the flagships offers some features that deserve a mention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 has an unusual Slow Talk option that will slow down the speech of the other caller. We guess this could be useful for bilingual calls where you need more time to process what was said. The phone app even has an equalizer with Normal, Bright and Smooth presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is offering voice modes of its own - including support for the cool Adapt sound feature. The smartphone is also pretty concerned with who calls you. Blocking mode disables notifications for calls and messages (even alarms and timers) during select periods. Only priority contacts can get through.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone will also help you fight spam by blocking certain numbers from calling or sending messages. Other message features include delayed send, which waits 3 to 30 seconds before actually sending the message (you know how you spot a typo only after you hit send?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both companies worked on their own keyboards. They have the basics like predictive input and swipe typing, but Samsung has added a small floating keyboard option, which takes up less space and can be moved around (good for Multi View use). Sony's keyboard is skinnable - how it looks and what buttons are available can be customized with a quick setup wizard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones come with fully-fledged Office suites though they do differ in their choice of app. The Samsung Galaxy S5 lets you download Polaris Office 5 for free but you'll need to sign up for Samsung Apps. The Sony Xperia Z2 on the other hand comes with the Office Suite 7 preloaded.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is entering the health lifestyle business with multiple accessories, but the Galaxy S5 also has a heart rate monitor on board. Better yet, it comes with the S Health app, which is a complete solution - it tracks you calorie intake and exercises in detailed logs. The heart rate monitor allows it to get a more accurate reading on how many calories you've burned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The accelerometer-based step counter always works in the background, so you get credit for walking during the day too. S Health can connect wirelessly to accessories - both over Bluetooth 4.0 and ANT+, and both Samsung-made and third-party accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has a health accessory too, the Smart Band. It works as a step counter, but it will also monitor your sleep and pick the best time to wake you. It comes with a Lifelog app that is part exercise tracker, part life logger. This app doesn't work well without the band though and the exercise tracking isn't nearly as advanced as what S Health offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One Sony market Samsung hasn't entered yet is gaming. The PlayStation app connects to your PS4 console and lets you view news, your profile, chat with PSN friends and display game alerts. The Xperia Z2 is also compatible with DualShock 3 controllers so you can play games with proper joystick and buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The What's new app will help you discover new games and apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the IR blaster on the Galaxy S5 and the app that controls it. Smart Remote does more than just change channels though, it will ask which service provider you're using and display the TV schedule, as well as offer the synopsis of the upcoming episode or let you set a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony bundles the Smart Connect app on its phones with which you can automate certain tasks. It can mute the phone during the night or start the music player when you plug in the headphones. The company has yet to add NFC support though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy S5. Blocking mode, S Health and an IR app are all great to have out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 will probably appeal to the gaming crowd with its PlayStation integration - both the console and the controller.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If Sony and Samsung were schools, the Xperia Z2 and Galaxy S5 would be their top achievers. They will be the ones starring in a video telling you how much they've learned about design, photography and music. In short, they stand for the best of what both companies can do and implicitly promote their broader product lines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has always been a hardware company first and a software company by necessity. The Xperia Z2 design certainly makes it one of the most attractive handsets on the market, even if the bezels around its 5.2" screen could use some slimming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the screen, Sony finally found the right formula for a beautiful display, but the company - inexplicably - continues to struggle with the camera. This is the third phone with Sony's whopping 1/2.3" sensor yet there are still issues with image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The move to front-facing stereo speakers help steal some music cred from the HTC Ones, while the battery life is another vote in Sony's favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the software side, the Xperia Z2 keeps things relatively light. The UI is touched-up stock Android and the major app contributions come from Sony's staple businesses - camera, music and gaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In broader terms, Samsung has never had the premium image of the Japanese, positioning itself firmly in the mass market. This reflects in the Galaxy S5 - if you had to pick one word to describe it, it would be "utilitarian" rather than "trend-setter". Admittedly, the Koreans are learning good design too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, the giant screen manufacturing plants for screens and camera sensors came through in a big way this year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mass market soul of the Galaxy S5 shows through in TouchWiz, there's a feature for everyone. The Xperia Z2 has all the features you would expect of a 2014 flagship, but the Samsung Galaxy S5 expertly backs apps with hardware features - the fingerprint and heart rate scanners enable functionality outside the reach of even the Apple iPhone 5s (where fingerprint reader is exclusive to native services).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end there's no need for a sign pointing glass design fans one way and camera buffs the other. The Sony Xperia Z2 and Samsung Galaxy S5 have more in common than their predecessors ever did. We know how that battle went on a market level, but this year, on a personal level, the choice between the two comes down to the most subtle of personal preferences and taste.</paragraph>
