			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Close your eyes and picture the Samsung Galaxy S6, but the way you wanted it to be, not the way it came out. Now open them and look at the Galaxy S7. Better? Let's see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S6 was Samsung's response to growing criticism that the design of its high-end models just didn't live up to their price tag and market position. Okay then, a dual-glass sandwich with aluminum all around is premium enough, but you had to live without the storage expansion, replaceable battery and protection against the elements that were all available in the Galaxy S5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 marks the return of the microSD slot and water-proofing, and while the battery is still sealed (which doesn't seem likely to change going forward), Samsung has been a lot more generous with the capacity for this generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Galaxy flagships have always led the way when it comes to imaging, their cameras always being among the top performers in the market. This time around, Samsung went backwards to play a different game of numbers: fewer but larger pixels, all 12 million of them capable of phase detection. Lightning-fast autofocus is the promise, and we've already seen the S7 deliver on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AMOLED has long since shaken off the stigma of being all punch and no precision, to actually bring the best of both worlds. The Always On displays are all the rage this season, and being able to light up individual pixels has always made this specific technology inherently suited for the job. "Why so late?" is probably the question to be answered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio is perhaps gone for good, the assumption apparently being that the jury has ruled in favor of streaming over the internet. The IR blaster is another feature due for retirement - the S6 had it, then the Note5 didn't, and now with the S7 the trend is clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: A software update has enabled the FM radio at least on T-Mobile S7/S7 edge in the US. It turns out the FM receiver hardware has always been there and was just not enabled at launch. The T-Mobile units are powered by the Snapdragon 820 chipset, so technically the option is there for all variants running on Qualcomm's chip. Our international unit, however, runs on the Exynos 8890 and so far we haven't heard of FM radio enabling update (if there ever will be one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The design-conscious among potential buyers will likely be looking at the Galaxy S7 edge, but that in no way makes the vanilla S7 the ugly duckling. The S6's shapes have been refined, gentle curves have replaced whatever sharp edges the old model had, the camera module now only barely sticks out - in other words, the familiar design was improved and refined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, we're taking a closer look at exactly the build and finish. We kick off with the unboxing and exterior overview after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Galaxy S7 unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S7 comes in a newly-designed retail box, which slips out of a sleeve with the phone's name embossed on it in bright colors. The actual box is covered by a flap - no more waiting for gravity to help lift the tight fitting lid of the older packages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone sits on top and underneath there's a separately packed headset (same as the one bundled with the S6), a fast charger, a USB-to-microUSB cable, and a USB-to-microUSB adapter, with USB OTG support. Using that you can turn the S7 into a power bank for charging other devices - the most obvious use case would be to top up wearables on the go, but also to salvage a friend's phone should the circumstances call for it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S7 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Size has hardly changed - a mere millimeter in each dimension. The Galaxy S7 measures 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9mm, which is shorter and narrower than the Galaxy S6's 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8 mm, but also thicker. That 1.1mm of extra depth pays back handsomely in battery capacity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S7 is also heavier, at 152g compared to the Galaxy S6's 138g. The difference is subtle, perhaps the only way to appreciate it is if you deliberately compare the two side by side.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Five generations of Samsung Galaxy S models were made of plastic, and as the years passed that became an issue with industry pundits and users alike, insisting that the build quality and overall feel of the devices didn't quite live up to their price point and spec sheet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In came the Galaxy S6/S6 edge around this time last year, introducing a glass/aluminum body, a design later featured on the Galaxy S6 edge+ and further refined on Galaxy Note5. It is precisely the Note5 that the S7 takes after, with a few additional touches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the most notable changes is on the front, where the Gorilla Glass 4 panel has been shaped in such a way that it slopes differently towards the sides than it does top and bottom. It's the most minute of differences and you may need someone to point it out for you if you're not the type to examine your gadgets up-close, but once you're aware of it, you'll appreciate the attention to detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One point the more picky among us insist on making is that the S6's frame would stick out just a smidgen above the glass panels here and there, both front and back, and particularly in the corners. While it wasn't all that big of a deal, it would come at odds with the otherwise premium aspirations of the phone. Nothing of the sort with the S7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The return of IP68 certification is another welcome change compared to the S6. The Galaxy S7 can be immersed in up to 1.5m for up to 30 minutes, making water-related accidents one less thing to worry about. That's the 8 in IP68, but no one seems to be focusing on the 6, which means the S7 is also dust tight - great if you bake bread or make pizza for a living, for instance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the forehead, the Galaxy S7 has a nearly identical arrangement of the selfie camera, earpiece and proximity/ambient light sensors as the S6. And, like the S6, the S7 has an LED notification light to the left of the earpiece - a feature sorely missing on the A-series, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The physical Home button, a staple of Samsung smartphone design, has been slightly modified too. Where on the S6 it had half-circles left and right, on the S7 it can best be described as a rounded rectangle - there are slight straight sections on either side, for all three people who care.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It still houses a fingerprint sensor, of the tap variety - you don't need to swipe, and do so with a particular speed like earlier Samsung designs. Instead, you press the Home button to wake up the phone and keep your finger on the button while it reads your print and unlocks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not always on, so you can't skip the waking up part, which is something to get used to if you're coming from most any of the Chinese brands or one of the latest Nexuses. However, it's the way Samsung's chosen to implement the feature and it's also the norm in the iPhone world, so obviously half the population are already used to having it this way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around the back, the similarities with the Note5 are more apparent. The curved sides come straight from the latest high-end phablet and do wonders in masking the increased thickness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung likes to make a point in promo materials about how the camera module now only sticks out by 0.46mm from the back, but the thing is that's perhaps almost entirely because of the extra 1.1mm added to the waistline. To reiterate though, we're perfectly fine with the 7.9mm of overall thickness, and also enjoy the smaller camera bump, it's just that the latter is more of a consequence and not an achievement in itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The arrangement on the back is also nothing new - the camera is centrally placed, the flash, and sensor array on its right. For the detail freaks, the insert underneath the lens front element is now black, regardless of the phone body paint - same as on the Note5, and unlike the entire S6 family, where it would match the body color instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy S7 now holds the SIM card tray, which also doubles as a microSD card tray - hooray! Our single-SIM review unit can hold one nano SIM and a microSD, while dual-SIM models have a hybrid slot - it can either take two nano SIMs or a nano SIM and a microSD. There's also a secondary mic on top, but the IR emitter is gone, likely for good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom holds the microUSB 2.0 port (no Type-C port for better or for worse), the primary mic, a single speaker and a 3.5mm jack. None of these are aligned with any of the other, which may bother a particular demographic, but in such crammed spaces you take what you can get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phone is home to the power button, while on the left you get two discrete volume buttons. The placement is typical Samsung, the execution is in line with the company's premium lineup. The frame itself has the exact same vibe as on the Note5, only scaled down obviously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the hand, the Galaxy S7 feels reassuringly solid, and you probably won't mind the added heft, compared to the previous model. It's also not all that slippery you'd expect from a dual-glass body - but fingerprints are an issue you'll be dealing with daily.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Still 5.1 inches, even better now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Third generation in a row, the Samsung Galaxy S flagship comes with a 5.1-inch display and for the second time it has QHD (or 1,440 x 2,560 pixels) resolution. The subpixels are arranged in the familiar Diamond Pentile fashion, meaning the green subpixels are twice as many as any other single color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're happy to see that Samsung is offering higher maximum screen brightness on the S7 when compared to the S6. The overdrive mode, which kicks in under bright sunlight if you have Auto brightness ON, goes a bit lower than what we saw on the S6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimum display brightness is 2.1nits, which is perfectly suitable for late-night reading in a dark room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color accuracy of the screen is top notch as long as you opt for the Basic display mode. The other available modes make colors pop but they are nowhere near as color accurate as Basic (Average DeltaE 2000 of 1.7 and Max DeltaE of 2.3). For comparison, the Avg DeltaE in Adaptive mode is 7.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 posted a remarkable result in our sunlight legibility test, second only to Samsung's own Galaxy S6 edge+.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Exynos 8890 chipset is paired with an LTE Cat. 9 modem. Theoretical maximums are 450Mbps downlink and 50Mbps uplink. If you have access to an HSPA network only, you'll get a maximum of 42Mbps and 5.76Mbps respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S7 supports Wi-Fi ac networks for fast local connectivity. Wi-Fi, a/b/g/n at 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks are also supported, of course. Then there's Bluetooth 4.2 LE (for smartwatches, sport sensors and such) and apt-X codec (for high-quality audio streaming).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC support is present and is used for Samsung Pay (in conjunction with MST), which lets the S7 replace your credit cards. It's also useful for pairing with other devices and reading NFC tags.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port on the bottom of the phone supports fast charging and regular USB 2.0 transfer speeds. With the included adapter you can easily use the USB Host and OTG support - you can connect a mouse or a keyboard, USB flash sticks, or just use the Galaxy S7 as a power bank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed the Galaxy S7 lacks MHL support, which should render wired TV-out impossible. But since the wireless options are that rich, we suspect few people will miss it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S7 battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Battery capacity is one more key area where Samsung gives you more with the Galaxy S7. The smartphone packs a 3,000mAh power bank, a substantial increase over the S6's 2,550mAh. Okay, the battery is still sealed, but that's a lot easier to live with when there's simply more of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also quick to charge, even if the S7 only supports Qualcomm's QuickCharge 2.0 standard and not the latest version 3.0. Samsung promises 0 to 100% in 90min for the S7, but doesn't say just how rapidly those percentages climb from flat to, say, 70% where it starts to taper off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the company's last-year flagships, the Galaxy S7 is also capable of wireless charging with pads compliant with both Qi and PMA. Samsung will also sell you a fast wireless charging pad, which can fill up the battery nearly as fast as a cable will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's move on to our test results, where the S7 does indeed outlast its predecessor. 23 hours of voice calls on a 3G network is three more than the S6, and the nearly 15 hours of video playback are about 2 and a half on top of last year's model, and an impressive achievement in its own right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's web browsing that is a slight letdown, at nine and a half hours with the built-in TouchWiz browser. We did manage to squeeze close to an hour more using Chrome, but even 10:20h isn't spectacular. Still, in the scorecard we've used Samsung's own browser result, as that's our default course of action when more than one app is provided.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Always On display feature was always going to be a battery drainer, no two ways about it. Samsung's claim that it would cost you 1% per hour seems about right and it does leave a huge impact on the overall endurance rating. That's because our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which we carried out with the AOD off and then once again with AOD on. These results are not featured in our test scorecard but are calculated in the total rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since its launch, the AOD setting has been optimized and now allows you to schedule times to activate it. Of course, your mileage will vary depending on how long you keep the phone out of your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary rating denotes the number of hours the phone will be operational if you are to make an hour of 3G talks, web browsing and video playback per day. Such usage pattern is of course entirely artificial, but we've established it so our battery results are comparable across devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties. You can also check out our complete battery test table, where you can see how all of the smartphones we've tested will compare under your own typical use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz-ed Marshmallow, what'd you expect?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As any self-respecting flagship should, the Samsung Galaxy S7 ships with Google's latest available OS version, Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. On top there's the obligatory TouchWiz layer, in its latest iteration too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What that means is that the S7 has conceptually a lot more in common with older Samsung models than it does with stock Android, and that's been polarizing customers and reviewers alike for about as long as there have been Galaxies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen typically holds a clock and date with two shortcuts in the bottom corners for Camera and Dialer. You're likely going to be launching the camera with a double press on the home button if you need the absolute quickest access, so that makes one of the shortcuts redundant. Good thing then that each of them can be changed to any app you have installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fingerprint unlock is a must have-feature and Samsung has been sticking with the press-and-hold variety since the S6. Or wake-and-tap, should you decide to wake up the phone with the power button. Either way, you need to wake it up first, the sensor isn't always on, which wastes precious milliseconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It does work well and if for some reason it cant recognize a finger in 3 tries, it lets you input the backup password. Ignore it and unsuccessfully try with a finger twice more and you'd be locked out of your device for 30 seconds giving you time to come up with a different tactic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen features a new Always-On function, which, as we established on the previous page, draws about 1% battery charge per hour. You can set up a time period, during which the feature will be on - some will lean towards a night-clock type of schedule, while others may prefer to be able to get a quick glance at notifications with the phone lying on the desk at work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the time and date, the screen can be set to show a subtle wallpaper to make things a little fancier. You can download additional always-on themes from the store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Size aside, the homescreen is identical to the TouchWiz home of other Samsung phones. However, Samsung has chosen a four-in-a-row default setup on the S7, with large, easy to tap icons. The dock can fit five, and so can the homescreen - grid size can be 4x4, 4x5, or 5x5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 user interface has theming support. We only got one theme pre-installed, but the Theme store has a vast selection available to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on where you are in the world, your leftmost homescreen would be either the Flipboard-powered Briefing or a new service called Upday (this is the one we got on our international unit). The two do pretty much the same thing ? they aggregate news according to a pre-defined list of interests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer can be arranged alphabetically, or in a custom order, and a search function is provided. You can alternatively disable the app drawer altogether, making for a single-tiered interface. That last feature is part of Galaxy Labs and is still experimental, so we may or may not see it in as part of the standard TouchWiz in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notification area is pretty busy by default. It starts with a scrollable line of quick toggles on top, then a brightness slider, then the Quick connect button. You can hide the latter from the Edit option, which also lets you re-arrange the quick toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Split-screen multitasking is supported on the S7, even if the 5.1-inch display doesn't appear to offer all that much room to maneuver. As always, only supported apps can work in split-screen, but Samsung's implementation is the most widely supported. Floating app windows are available for some apps, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some cool gestures are available for the Galaxy S7 - you can flip the phone for mute, swipe your palm for screenshot, double-press the Home key for quick camera access, quick call, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S7 comes free of bloatware, but has a few Microsoft apps pre-installed (MS Office, OneDrive with 100GB for 2-years, Skype). The phone starts with 32GB, but a quarter of that (7.5GB) is already used up by the system. You can rid of the MS apps and some of the Google's apps (Drive, Photos, Hangouts), and you can free up additional 500MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, by the way, Samsung has followed other manufacturers and implemented a scrolling screenshot feature, which works well when having to capture long web pages or lists. Too bad that YouTube keeps giving you more results and that list can go on forever.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Game Launcher<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Game Launcher is a new app/service, which groups all of your games at one place. But that's just the beginning. The Game Launcher has a few powerful tricks, some of them a must have for avid gamers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, the Game Launcher has two Power Saving game modes - Save Power and Save Maximum Power. The Save Power options caps the frame rate at 30fps (instead of 60fps), and lowers the resolution. The Maximum mode furtherly lowers the resolution in addition to the 30fps cap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next, the Game Launcher has its own DND mode - you can disable all alerts during a game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Game Tools key. It's a small floating virtual key you can position pretty much anywhere on the screen. Once tapped, it reveals additional actions such as No Alerts, Lock Recent and Back keys, Minimize Game, Take Screenshot, and Record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Locking the capacitive keys is crucial for a seamless game experience, as we found ourselves closing accidentally a game two times in just under five minutes!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Record option is rather interesting. It captures a video of your game, but you can choose to either capture the in-game audio or record external sound using phone's microphone. The video recording also supports a watermark - you can set a static picture, or use the front camera to embed yourself in the video. YouTubers will find those very useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Game Launcher also offers Top Charts and Featured Videos tabs, where you can check some nice game stats, and find helpful videos about your games.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 comes in two different specs, one with the Snapdragon 820, the other with the Exynos 8890. Qualcomm's chipset has a quad-core CPU, two of the Kryo cores clocked at 2.15GHz, the other two - at 1.6GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have for review the Exynos flavor, and Samsung's own SoC relies on an octa-core CPU solution, in which you have four Mongoose cores, and four Cortex-A53's. The Mongoose cores behave differently depending on the task - two of them can go as high as 2.6GHz, while the other two are idling, or you can have all four of them ticking at 2.3GHz simultaneously. In theory that approach should provide heaps of power for all sorts of apps, regardless of the number of cores they can utilize, while keeping temperature in check.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different chips obviously come with matching GPUs, the Adreno 530 in the Snapdragon package, and the Mali-T880 MP12 in the Exynos variant. Regardless of chipset, the Galaxy S7 comes with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. A 64GB version is also supposedly going to be available, we haven't seen one yet though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 kicks off with the best single-core result we've seen, on Android that is, and by a long stretch. Remember, one Mongoose core ticks at 2.6GHz in this scenario, and it certainly makes a difference. The S7 edges ahead of the S7 edge (why, of course we're working on a review of that one concurrently), but the difference is well withing the statistical margin of error. And yes, the iPhone 6s still rules in the per-core performance, but it's only got two of them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-core results are even more impressive. The Galaxy S7 is hands down the fastest performer when all cores are utilized, Android or otherwise this time. The Meizu Pro 5, the highest scoring smartphone with last year's Exynos 7420 chip, sits closest followed by Samsung's own. The Nexus 6P is the highest ranking Snapdragon 810 offering, still not a match when it came out, not a match now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compound benchmarks should give a better understanding of overall performance, not just raw processing power. AnTuTu 6 comes first, alphabetically if for no other reason, and it won't be unfair to say that the Galaxy S7 smokes the competition. True, it's the first 2016 flagship we get to test, and results in the 130K ballpark are also to be expected by the myriad of Snapdragon 820 releases this year, it's just that the S7 beat them to it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II 2.0 comes next and we're starting to wonder if smartphones are approaching the ceiling of what the benchmark can measure. The Galaxy S7's score is only slightly higher than that of the Nexus 6P, and the distance to the ruling iPhone 6s is even smaller. Exynos 7420 devices from last year are further down though, so at least Samsung has managed to improve on its own chip.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On to graphics, to see how those 12 cores of the Mali-T880 GPU stack up. In Basemark X we witness a new record high, comfortably ahead of last-year's Samsung flagships, which in turn posted better numbers than competing Snapdragon 810 models.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark ES 3.1 provides a testing ground for OpenGL ES 3.1-compatible devices, and while results are not 100% immediately comparable, its iOS counterpart Basemark Metal gives a general idea where the two platforms stand relative to each other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And where they stand is closer than with last year's Android devices, that's for sure. Exynos 8890 scores more than twice as much as 7420 and the Snapdragon 810 is left behind as well. However, it is still the iPhone 6s that remains the true king in this benchmark, and early indications we have of the Snapdragon 820's performance, the status quo is looking to remain unchanged.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark ES 3.1 / Metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GFXBench 3.1 Manhattan is another OpenGL ES 3.1 test and the S7 is doing a very good job. In the offscreen part (run at 1080p on all tested devices regardless of actual display resolution) Samsung's flagship outperforms all of last year's flagships by a mile (hardly a surprise!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That translates into a solid number in the onscreen test - run at native resolution, where the QHD display of the S7 pulls it back. Still, the 15fps are a marked improvement over the Note5's 6.7fps, and also ahead of the 11fps of the QHD Nexuses.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.1 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the older GFXBench 3.0 test, the S7 matches the iPhone 6s in raw power, testified by the similar offscreen frame rates. These two are in a league of their own, no other phone making it past 65% of the S7's score.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't make a big deal out of the difference in onscreen frame rates between the iPhone 6s and the Galaxy S7 - the Samsung phone is dealing with 3.7 times as many pixels. On a level field against the Nexus 6P and Note5, the new GPU shows its strength posting a 60% and 80% higher frame rate, respectively.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In summary, another trend-setting performance by the Galaxy flagship. Heaps of raw CPU power in the S7 are coupled with graphics oomph, which no longer needs to make excuses for low frame rates with high display resolution.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S7 is available as a single-SIM phone, but there is a model with dual-SIM support, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the phonebook are pretty much the usual TouchWiz deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode can be put on an automated schedule. When it's on, only priority notifications can get through and you decide what counts as "priority" - it can be anything from calls from select contacts to reminders from key apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 delivered the same loudspeaker performance in our test as its predecessor, posting a Good score. The speaker sound quality is quite nice, too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 uses the good old Samsung keyboard, there's no sign of the A9 (2016)'s secondary symbols upon long press. That aside, it's quite feature-packed, with a dedicated numbers row, a row above that for word suggestions, as well as swipe input.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard can be resized, but the range is quite limited, and in this case you might as well stick with the default size. There's a high contrast keyboard mode, to help combat eyesight problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional typing tools include swipe input, My Hot Keys (predefined phrases that can be typed by long-pressing a number key) and voice dictation.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung continues to bundle the Microsoft app package that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and Skype.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Drive is pre-installed, however, the actual document editors are not (they are a free download, though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung-customized web browser features Web sign in - a feature that works as a password manager secured by your fingerprint. This makes log-ins as simple as unlocking the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>S Health is on board and it can fully utilize the hear-rate and blood oxygen sensors. It also tracks walking/running/cycling and you can manually input water and coffee intake and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Manager is a hub that controls several key areas - battery, RAM, Storage and Device security. This gives you tools to track down apps that drain the battery, use too much RAM and clean-up unnecessary files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Device Security tab lets you activate KNOX (protects the phone and OS from hacking but makes for longer boot times) and scan for malware. The My KNOX app lets you separate work and corporate apps and access by creating a secure, isolated space on the phone, which becomes inaccessible as soon as KNOX detects an unauthorized change in the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is the default file browser. It features Google Drive integration. You can ZIP folders to make them easier to share as a single file. It also allows batch file operations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's Galaxy Apps, Samsung's own app store. Galaxy Essentials is a good place to find great tools (like Kids Mode), but for general app shopping, you would probably be better off with Google Play.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz gallery orders photos by time, but you can switch to folder-based Album view. Thumbnail sizes can be resized with a pinch gensture and the album selection pane on the left can be hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing options include wireless printing, Android Beam and Wi-Fi Direct, but no DLNA (or other way to send an image to your TV). Several image editing tools are available - from basic cropping, to collage making, to a more capable editor (which supports image correction, effects and drawing).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music player with advanced EQ features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music is the default player for your tunes on the Galaxy S7. The app has been treated to the material design a while ago, and its functionality remains unchanged - it can play your local files, as well as stream music from the cloud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung sound enhancements are available, of course, you can access them from Play Music, too. They include the SoundAlive tool, which has an intuitive interface to tuning the equalizer (a manual 7-band equalizer is available for more knowledgeable users).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adapt Sound is even simpler. It tunes the EQ to your hearing and your particular pair of headphones by playing multiple frequencies and asking how well you hear them. Smart Volume automatically adjusts the volume of tracks from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>UHQ sound resolution enhancer is available, Surround sound emulation and Tube Amp Pro simulator are onboard, too.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no video player app pre-installed and the Gallery handles the videos by default. It has full subtitle support and pop-up player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an "Editor" option too though that may be overstating it - it just lets you trim the video. If you want a more capable video editor, there is such in the Galaxy Apps store for free, courtesy of Samsung.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output doesn't disappoint<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S7 almost perfectly matched the output of its predecessor with an active external amplifier. This is to say the smartphone delivered flawlessly clean output with just above average volume levels for an excellent showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stereo crosstalk did increase a bit more compared to what the Galaxy S6 had, but output remained very solid when headphones came into play. Volume didn't drop either, so it was all very good and worthy of a modern-day flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, here go the results so you can do your comparisons.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>New 12MP camera with dual-pixel tech for quick PDAF<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>More is usually better, and that's been Samsung's way of doing things for years, but with the Galaxy S7 that concept has been applied in different manner than you might think. The S6 had a 16MP camera, while the S7 has the total resolution lowered to 12MP. And that's about the only aspect where you could call the S7's camera a step back, though surely we've managed to convince you by now that pixel count is overrated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 has larger pixels (1.4 micron vs. 1.12 micron), brighter aperture (f/1.7 vs. f/1.9), more phase detection subpixels (well, all 12 million something of them), all the while keeping the optical image stabilization of the predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the phase detection agent at every pixel that qualifies the S7's camera for a dual-pixel moniker, and you've certainly grown accustomed to hearing that every time imaging on the S7 is concerned. And Samsung is rightfully proud of it - competing smartphone phase detection systems only use about 5% of the total pixels for focusing, and dual-pixel PDAF is only a thing in the DSLR world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's worth noting that our review unit is equipped with the Sony IMX260 sensor, and not Samsung's own ISOCELL variant, though performance should be comparable with both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The field of view is not as wide as on the S6 on the horizontal but the S7 captures more when it comes to the height of the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app is almost entirely the same as the one on the phone being replaced. It has a combined interface for stills and video, with virtual shutter release and record button on the one side and quick settings on the other. A few minor touches include an extra setting for resolution and a universally recognizable red dot symbol on the video record button instead of the more ambiguous video camera on older models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motion photo is available, too - it captures a three-second video before you've pressed the shutter and embeds it within the .jpg file. Upon the release of the phone, you could only view the videos on the device itself, or on other S7/S7 edge units.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Today, a few updates later, you can share the still image or the video separately with virtually anyone. Depending on the chosen aspect of the photo, you'd get either 960x720px or 1280x720px videos in an .mp4 format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pro mode gives you more photographic control and offers manual adjustments over shutter speed, exposure compensation, ISO sensitivity, and white balance. Manual focus is also available, and the S7 magnifies the center portion of the viewfinder, allowing you to better judge whats in focus and what not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality on the Galaxy S7 is excellent and the camera resolves plenty of detail. Noise, while present, contributes to adding texture instead of getting in the way. The level of resolved detail is mostly equivalent to the higher res images of the S6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Color rendition is very much similar to the S6. Colors are vibrant, but not over the top, consumer-friendly describes them well. White balance is consistently accurate. Dynamic range is good, and in high-contrast scenes the S7 tends to expose to preserve the highlights, thus rendering some of the shadows black - arguably the better approach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are a few shots taken with the Galaxy S6 for comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode is available on the S7 and it lets you toggle between Off, Auto and On. Samsung has struck a proper balance between salvaging details in both highlights and shadows, while also producing natural-looking images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A set of night-time samples show the S7's performance in the dark. While you shouldn't expect miracles, the smartphone does a great job with night scenes, light sources are sharp and well defined, and a lot of the detail has been preserved. The output is a lot better than the S6 - comparison samples below shot at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third sample was shot in a dimly-lit restaurant and could be taken as an indication of what to expect of the S7's camera in such social settings (not that lack of patrons looks awfully social).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 excels at panoramas too. When holding the phone in portrait the images can be as tall at the 4,032 pixels vertical resolution minus whatever cropping it needs to do to compensate for your tilting and moving the camera vertically. The Image below, for instance, measures 9,696x3,920 pixels or a total of 38MP, and it's not even a 180-degree rotation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from that, the stitching is flawless, with stationary objects, naturally. Exposure is consistent and the overall level of detail is nearly on par with still images. Now, Motion panorama is the new feature here and it records the action as it unfolds while you're sweeping, but that's not something we can show you here. The still panorama we can, find it below.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>5MP front camera shoots good selfies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the front the Galaxy S7 has the same 5MP camera as the S6, at least in terms of resolution. Apparently the target audience for the flagship doesn't take many selfies, Samsung thinks, and doesn't bother to install a higher-res sensor. Still, the aperture has gotten a bump to match the main shooter's f/1.7, and a screen fill flash is now available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are limited to 1440p, which is the most that can fit on the sensor in 16:9 ratio, and is also the resolution of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality from the front camera is more or less the same as the predecessor. It can't handle high-contrast scenes terribly well and blows out the highlights, but in all fairness, that scene would challenge a primary camera as well. More balanced lighting produces better results, and in any case skin tones are rendered in a very pleasing true-to-life way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 introduces a screen flash feature, which lights up the display to illuminate the subject (presumably yourself), helpful in the darkest of settings. It's not a new feature as smartphones go, it's just new to the Galaxy lineup. Below is a sample shot in our studio in complete darkness - quality is not overly inspiring but it's better than nothing which is what you'd get without the screen flash.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video camera has it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Befitting its flagship nature, the Galaxy S7's can capture video in 4K (2160p/30fps), 1080p/60fps, 1080p/30fps, as well as the less common 1440p/30fps and lesser resolutions. From the shooting modes you can select slow motion video (720p/240fps), and Hyperlapse. The latter has fixed speeds ranging from 4x to 32x, plus an Auto mode, where the S7 analyzes the footage and uses a variable speed depending on the action or lack thereof.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>4K videos are recorded with a bitrate of 48Mbps, 1080p/60fps are 28Mbps, while regular speed 1080p/30fps get 17Mbps. Either way audio is recorded in stereo at 256Kbps, so no complaints on the numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None when it comes to video quality either. 2160p videos are packed with detail, you can extract frames and have them pass as an 8MP photo, almost. Color reproduction is the same as still images, saturation neither drops, nor is additionally pumped up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>1080p/60fps is the one area we experienced some issues with focus hunting, apparently the S7 thinks that since we're using the higher framerate, we must be following some action closely. Other than that, videos are smooth and detailed, perhaps with a little noise in the darker areas. At 30fps the focusing is calmer and doesn't give us any reasons to protest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the untouched video samples: 4K at 30fps (15s, 84MB), 1080p at 60fps (15s, 49MB), 1080p at 30fps (13s, 26MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can use our Video Compare Tool to see how the Galaxy S7 stacks against the competition when it comes to video capturing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S7 key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Design follows the Galaxy Note5, but is further refined, especially on the front where the glass gently curves at the edges. Execution is simply superb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Water and dust protection should give you a peace of mind in adverse environmental conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AMOLED display looks pleasing in default mode, near-perfect color accuracy can be achieved with a relevant setting. Sunlight legibility is great, and maximum brightness has been further improved compared to the S6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Always On feature is useful and it's so inherent to AMOLED that we're wondering why it took so long. However, it does inevitably take a toll on battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no wired video out or FM radio, again, and the IR emitter is gone too, but at least the microSD slot is back, thankfully.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is good, but not exceptional - the 80-hour endurance rating is a little higher than the S6's 73 hours, but Always On display eats a big chunk of it. The S6 lasts longer in web browsing too, but the S7 trumps it with nearly 15 hours of video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S7 comes with little on top of the Google app suite - there are a few signature apps like S Planner and S Health and Samsung's custom multimedia software, but other than that, there's little in the way of bloatware. Microsoft's mobile app package is on board too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Standard-setting benchmark results, both the CPU and the GPU pack plenty of power and are chart-toppers, future-proofing is guaranteed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudspeaker scores "Good" on loudness, and its sound quality is among the better ones with deep sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clean audio output with external amp, only minor degradation with headphones, above average volume.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all-new 12MP still camera is capable of near-instant focus thanks to its dual-pixel technology. Images are detailed, dynamic range and colors are good, and in terms of image quality it's definitely an improvement over the S6's already excellent shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selfie camera is great at skin tone, but has a tendency of clipping highlights. It's also about time Samsung upped the resolution of its flagships front shooters, 5MP is a bit limiting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>4K videos are packed with detail, however camcorder struggles to hold on to focus at 1080p/60fps, which is the only bad thing we can say about it really.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Evolution. This is what the Galaxy S7 is all about. The S6 was the radically different Subject Zero, the S7 is Subject 0.1 if you will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual though, the numbers don't tell the whole story. The design of the S7 builds on the Note5, which was in turn a more polished (and obviously larger) Galaxy S6. The S7 adds more curves on the front, not as much as to undermine the S7 edge's claim to fame, but just enough to let your fingertips know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some will argue that removing features in one generation just to introduce them in the next for the sake of hype is questionable, to say the least. Others would say that Samsung has listened to its users and delivered on the requests. Does it really matter?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the thing, the Galaxy S7 carries some of the best traits of the lineup, with the tiny caveat that some of those might be lost for good. We have the microSD and IP certification return triumphantly, but then the IR blaster has disappeared and the battery will possibly stay sealed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Samsung did bring something entirely new with the S7, it's the 12MP camera. The dual-pixel sensor has as many phase-detection agents as there are pixels, and it really has no competition when it comes to focus speed. The lens is the brightest in business too, with an f/1.7 aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other headline feature is the Always On display, but the S7 shares the spotlight with the LG G5 on this one. Time/calendar and basic notifications at a glance sounds nice, but battery life takes a toll - a compromise solved with flick of a toggle in settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S7 leads the way of this season's flagships and if you're into impulse purchases it's the one to have, right here, right now. However, last year's Galaxy S6 is being massively discounted to make way for the successor, and is a real bargain. Sure, you won't be getting that lightning-fast autofocus, but camera resolution is higher and battery life is comparable. No storage expansion on the S6 and no protection against the elements, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If reason isn't a top priority and money is no object, the Galaxy S7 edge is the obvious choice. Same internals, but the larger 5.5-inch dual-curved display brings a lot more style points. The battery is larger, more so than the display, so battery life should be better on the edge, than on the vanilla S7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the LG G5. Announced hours apart, the Korean flasghips will be fighting for somewhat different crowds, it seems. The quirky G5 has a modular design and the plain chin of the smartphone can be replaced by a camera grip or a DAC chip for improved audio output, not to mention the battery is replaceable. And of course, the G5 has a unique dual-camera setup on the back, one of them with a superwide 135-degree lens. It takes a special kind of person to appreciate all these, though, and you'll know if you are one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG-made Nexus 5X is another option, for about half the price of the S7. Not exactly able to match the Samsung phone in raw performance, it's got a comparable camera but inferior battery life in all tests. It's also far from the S7 in terms of looks and feel, its plastic build being far from premium.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Certainly, the iPhone 6s has to be mentioned when shopping for a flagship. The Galaxy S7 outlasts it in the battery department and there's the matter of expandable storage, which we're unlikely to ever see on an iPhone. The iPhone is not waterproof either, at least not officially rated, so that's another checkbox ticked on the S7. The iPhone is the default choice for people invested in the Apple ecosystem however, and that's a mindset that doesn't change all that easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last year's top models are still more than good enough. The Sony Xperia Z5 for instance is the only one to match the S7's IP rating, and the two have other things in common like glass/metal bodies and microSD slot. Battery life is geared differently in the two - the Xperia lasts longer on the web, but only half of the S7's 15 hours of video playback, so these may tip the scales one way or the other. The Z5's camera has twice as many pixels though, which may be important to some, and Sony's phone has an FM radio receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's flagships have always been the trend-setters, and the Galaxy S7 proudly joins its predecessors. Fair enough, after the fundamental overhaul last year, the focus in 2016 is on fine-tuning, polish and refinement. The camera and the Always On display are the couple of attention grabbers but the big story is simple, as usual. The Galaxy S7 is such a complete package that taking a rest on the seventh was obviously never on Samsung's mind.</paragraph>
