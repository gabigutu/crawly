			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E72 is one of those handsets everybody is talking about long before their release. There may be nothing much to talk about - after all everyone knows what to expect of the Eseries and they have never let us down. But still, savoring the next batch of Eseries steel is always a pleasure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Finns keep feeding business ammo to the market and there's nothing out of the usual at first sight. We already tasted the new Eseries generation and the E52 and E55 were the usual good healthy meals. The E72 though needs to be nothing short of delicious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no need to tell you the Nokia E72 walks and talks business. The big one though has greater responsibility to carry. We guess the E72 will not fear being judged against the best messengers in its class. But it will certainly look back to a haunting shadow within its own family. The Nokia E72 can certainly go where the E71 would not venture. But it's not only the equipment (of which the E72 has aplenty) that makes a winner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eseries are always trying to get more skills on their resume. But the one that's supposed to be the next big thing in its class is really pushing it. Nokia didn't have to try and experiment with the E72. Build muscle on the E71 was their main objective. And by the looks of it they did more than well. The E72 promises richer experience and superior skill. But it will still be expected to deliver more than the sum of its parts if it wants to prove anything to the standard-setting E71.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Eseries spirit is all there - and we guess in-house competition is always in the picture. The E72 is bold and impressive, but manages to keep its cool too, as befits a conservative business handset. Armed and dangerous or polite and elaborate - the E72 will be whatever you want it to be. So, make up your mind, and take the jump. We're unboxing and feeling the cold Eseries steel in our hands.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A lot of goodies in the box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Nokia E72 has all the essential luggage for a business tool. It's hardly a surprise though, as the E71 already had nearly the same ingredients. The E72 comes with a standard charger (not the smaller variety that we expected) and a really short data cable (microUSB). We didn't quite expect Nokia to cut corners with an expensive phone like E72 but they obviously did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 4GB microSD card is prebundled (E71 had 2-gigs of complimentary storage) and so is a standard Nokia headset. It is one piece, which means you cannot use the remote with another set of headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The extra content in the box includes a leather lanyard, a leather carrying case and a branded cleaning cloth. The rest is the usual paperwork and leaflets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E72 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E72 stands at 114 x 58 x 10 mm and weighs 128g, which is - you guessed it right - almost exactly the same as the E71 (114 x 57 x 10 mm, 127g). It is obvious that Nokia had little choice but follow the E71 recipe as closely as possible. Yep, they've used the more recent Eseries styling (E52 and E55) but the form factor and general feel just couldn't have been much different. The actual upgrades the E72 brings over the E71 are not the point here. It's the styling and the first impression. Our initial feeling is the E72 is trying to show more sophistication but does it look a bit softer or is it just us? Let's see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E72 is still among the slimmest QWERTY handsets on the market and comes in three colors: Zodium Black, Metal Grey and Topaz Brown.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The sweeping success of the E71 seems to open a wide latitude for the E72 to explore. But the upgrade will also have to live up to some seriously high expectations. The E72 is a high-end business tool and it looks it. It somehow fails though to repeat the strong impression the E71 produced. Fair enough, we're either spoiled by the Eseries or the E71 was just that rare stroke of genius to make a QWERTY messenger one of the sexiest handsets lately. And at the same time it does look super sharp and unforgiving. By the way, this may as well have been the desired effect. A more refined and polished E72 selling alongside a lean and mean E71.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece of Nokia E72 is placed dead center at the top of the front panel. A little to the right is the ambient light sensor and the video-call camera. The ambient light sensor does well to optimize screen brightness and the excellent backlighting of the QWERTY keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below is the 2.36" QVGA display, followed by the main bank of control and navigation keys and the QWERTY keyboard. The screen, keyboard and controls will get their due coverage in a short while. At the left bottom corner is the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's three-button combo on the right hand side - the volume rocker with a dedicated voice command key between the up and down buttons. The layout works well - you're not likely to mispress the voice command key, which is sunk lower than the volume controls. The problem is the actual volume keys have a somewhat low stroke and poor feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you'll find the standard microUSB port and the microSD card slot. Both apertures are sealed with plastic caps to hold off dust, and keep the contour of the handset intact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top are the power button and the 3.5 mm audio jack. There is no sign of the unsightly red power knob of Nokia E71 and this time the key is even a bit concave, so accidental presses are almost completely ruled out. The power button lets you quickly toggle ringing profiles, lock the keypad or safely remove the memory card. There is an extra option too to get in and out of power-saving mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of Nokia's latest messenger features the charger plug and the lanyard eyelet, both squeezed in the left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of Nokia E72 is made of finely-grooved stainless steel and doesn't seem to have the same finger-print issues as the E71. It will get smudges too but cleaning is easy and a cloth is provided in the retail box. The E71 rear was almost impossible to clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside, the Nokia E72 features the 5 megapixel camera lens with LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens sticks out a mile and there is no lens protection, except that it is a tiny bit recessed. If you carry your handset in the pocket, it would most definitely get scratched. Still the whole camera module looks quite stylish and fits the overall design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice little latch at the base of the battery cover allows you to release it quickly and easily. You slide it gently and the all-metal plate simply pops out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's under the cover will hardly come as a surprise: the 1500 mAh BP-4L Li-Ion battery is the same unit we saw - and appreciated - in the Nokia E71. For the E72 it is even quoted at 576 hours of stand-by time and 12 and a half hours of talk time to just outperform its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering the excellent battery life of the E71, we are more than sure the E72 won't let you down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 will definitely turn heads. We personally will miss some of that intimidating charisma that made the E71 so hard to resist. The E72 is no less of a power tool but it's somehow not letting its horsepower ooze from every pore. And that by the way it has in excess. The E72 handles nicely and ergonomics are top notch. It still has every box ticked on our checklist for design: practical, slim, smart, steel-clad, fingerprint resistive.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Small display fits the style<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E72 features a 2.36" 16M-color QVGA display. It's the same size as the screens of E71 and E63. And size is hardly an issue here, even from an upgrader's point of view. The resolution though is a different matter. A slightly more pixel-dense screen would've certainly made as big a difference as any of the otherwise valuable additions (better CPU, optical trackpad, 3.5 mm jack just to name a few). We've seen Nokia do it for S40 (6260 slide) and it's high time perhaps they considered the competition of BlackBerry screens more seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen performance is still great, with excellent contrast and vivid image. Sunlight legibility is not an issue for Nokia E72 display ranking it among the best of its class.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keyboard is key<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 QWERTY keyboard is an almost complete replica of what we had with the E63, some changes notable compared to the E71. Despite the few minor tweaks, the overall usability is intact. The space bar on the E72 is smaller, leaving room for two extra keys. One of them is particularly useful: the Symbol button will toggle Bluetooth on and off upon a long press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, pressing and holding the space bar in standby powers up the LED so you can use your handset a flashlight. That's a nice little perk and it even overrides the keyboard lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maybe you shouldn't expect regular desktop typing speed and you'll certainly have to look at the keypad but you can achieve pretty decent results with the E72. If you are into typing lots of messages you are sure to get used to it quickly and start speeding your way through texts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls above the keypad have the more recent Eseries styling along the lines of the E52 and E55. The logic is the same though - two selection keys, Call and End buttons, the menu key and the three so-called one-touch keys. One-touch keys can be set as shortcuts to any application you like, never mind the icons on them might suggest otherwise. Furthermore, you can assign two applications per key, making use of the press and press-and-hold function on all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time instead of the solid one-touch keys on the E71 sunk amid slightly raised call buttons and soft keys, we have the opposite layout. The call/softkey deck is flat, using one shared plate, while the four program keys are raised and U-shaped, which makes them very thumb-friendly and minimizes wrong presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard backlighting is impressive to make the phone no problem to handle in the dark. You can set the LED around the D-pad to notify of missed events like incoming messages or missed calls. There is also a breathing light option - slow blinks in standby when the screen is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The big news is the trackpad functionality of the D-pad. In pure directional pad terms, the E72 is doing well - the D-pad is small but very tactile and allows very comfortable vertical and horizontal scrolling and selection. The optical trackpad in the middle is a bit let down by the size of the button. It works just fine, but the raised directional ridge does limit the available space for thumb sweeps. This seems to affect horizontal scrolling worse than vertical navigation. It's easy to feel the difference on the BlackBerry Bold 9700 trackpad: it's virtually the same size but does much better in terms of speed and response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The E72 trackpad, which Nokia call optical Navi key, has three sensitivity settings: low, medium and high. High is what nearly gave us the response we were looking for, though horizontal scrolling remained somewhat problematic. The lower sensitivity settings we found just about useless. The trackpad is haptic enabled too, gentle vibrations marking every thumb sweep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The trackpad however is amazingly useful in camera mode. Mind you, we're talking a phone without an actual shutter key. Placing your finger on the trackpad activates the autofocus and locks it, and then a full press down captures the image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works like a charm, and gives the user a lot more control over the shot than say, virtual shutter keys on touch phones. And this is incomparably better than the ridiculous two-key focus/capture routine on the E71.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: S60 3rd edition does not surprise<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E72 runs on Symbian 9.3 OS with the Series60 3rd Edition user interface. It has Feature Pack 2 like the E52, E55 and the E75 side-slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More importantly though, the Nokia E72 is powered by the same 600 MHz CPU as the E55. In Symbian terms, that's a lot, not even Nokia's current flagship - the N97 - can match it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's main menu has two view modes: a 4 x 3 grid of icons and a list. The E72 comes with the new S60 icons for a pinch of 5th edition (touch) styling. However, with the E72 you cannot opt for having animated icons like on some other Nokia phones. This is probably just another way of reiterating the business focus of the phone. At least the font size is widely configurable depending on your preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The optical trackpad is a nice addition and can make navigating the menus even smoother. Unfortunately, the imposing frame of the square D-pad doesn't favor thumb sweeping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active stand-by mode goes without saying on the Nokia E72. This is a convenient way to add shortcuts to all your favorite applications on the homescreen. You can even assign shortcuts to websites of your choice for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition you can bring up to fourteen different kinds of notifications on the homescreen: email boxes and voice mail, through calendar and to-dos, to the currently running track in the Music player and FM radio. Choosing how many of those fourteen items to use is completely up to you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of the one-touch keys (messaging and calendar) below the display can be customized to access any feature (actually two per key) of choice. The two soft keys functions are user-configurable too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another handy feature of recent Eseries handsets allows you to toggle between two different phone setups - the so-called Mode Switcher. Each of them can be customized with its own theme and homescreen applications for maximum usability. This way you can have both a leisure and a business profile and switch between them with a single click.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in memory is 250MB, which is a decent amount. The included 4GB microSD memory card comes in very handy for extending it, but higher capacity cards up to 16GB are supported as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we managed to confirm, Nokia E72 has no problem handling a 16GB microSD card. Accessing applications or any other files on the memory card is quick and you probably won't notice any difference compared to accessing data in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with any Symbian phone, there is a built-in voice recognition system. It is launched by the dedicated key on the right side of the E72 and does a good job. It's fully speaker-independent and recognizes a very high percentage of the user commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's a nice security feature known as Remote Lock. If your Nokia E72 gets stolen or lost, you simply send a coded SMS message to remotely lock the phone. After three unsuccessful attempts to unlock it, it wipes itself clean of all personal or sensitive info. You might not get your Nokia E72 back, but at least nobody will get your personal data either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great Symbian phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Nokia E72 does a tremendous job, offering storage space for a virtually unlimited number of contacts and fields with all the available memory potentially usable for that purpose. You are also treated to as many fields for each contact as you like and some other nice extras, so there's no reason to complain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name, and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any name. You can pick whether you want the SIM contacts, the service numbers or the phone memory contacts to be displayed or alternatively show them all at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Predictive search, contact list back-up, as well as grouping, are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers an enormous variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you are able to think of any.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Personal ringtones and video can also be assigned. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log application can hold up to 20 call records in each of the tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls. These are all accessed by pressing the Call key in standby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers. You can even filter the entries (by contact or by type), a useful feature if you're looking for a specific call.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: calls good, loudspeaker quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With Nokia E72 you are unlikely to experience any reception issues. Sound during calls is very clear and free of any interferences. It's not too loud at the loudest setting but it will do great unless you're in a very noise setting. Like quite a number of Nokia handsets, the E72 features advanced noise cancelling, which usually works quite nice to filter background noise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E72 also has a Smart dialing feature, which helps you quickly find a contact straight on the standby screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E72 didn't come with the Advanced Communication Manager application out of the box and the free version available in the Ovi Store is just a trial worth 20 calls. Shame this top-of-the-line business model lacks such a helpful app for filtering calls based on black and whitelists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 also has support for VoIP calls - you just contact your VoIP service provider and get the internet call connection settings, then you are all set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conducted our traditional speakerphone test with Nokia E72 and it performed rather poorly, scoring Below Average. Here is how it compares to same of the other handsets we have tested. You can find information on the actual testing process, along with the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The business of messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Eseries devices are mostly about messaging and connectivity and who would know that better than the supreme Nokia E72. The first time you start your phone you're prompted to set up your email account, leaving no doubt that the E72 is equal parts a phone and a messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text entry is a make-or-break feature of devices meant for heavy messaging. Besides the relatively comfy keyboard, you can also use prediction, auto-completion, set the level of spelling correction and a couple of more tweaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We suggest trying out the different settings - for example the High setting for spelling correction might be too intrusive and you can set how the suggested word is displayed, either in place or above the currently typed word. If you spend five minutes on this, you'll maximize your typing productivity, while minimizing the number of spelling errors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the whole, the E72 great email client and the ability to view and edit office documents will really help keep you up to date while you're away from the office. Just like E52 and E55, E72 also comes with the Nokia Messaging software preloaded along with a lifetime service subscription.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are three message editors aboard: SMS and MMS share the first one, audio and e-mail have their own. The SMS editor is the familiar application for all Symbian S60 smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client has great looks and messaging organization. Each of the folders of your mailbox can now be sorted by whatever filters you might like and can then be searched if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also define what the folders preview should look like, i.e. how many lines per entry, whether title dividers should be applied etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports a wide range of personal and corporate email standards such as Ovi Mail (obviously), IBM Lotus Notes Traveller, Microsoft Exchange, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Windows Live Hotmail etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Encryption is also enabled, as well as mobile VPN support for connecting to secure corporate Intranets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the Nokia E72 supports the ultra easy email setup of all recent Nokia handsets. The email setup has been slightly redesigned - you get a list of the six most popular email providers and an "Other" option for the rest. From then on it's the same as before - enter your email address and password and E72 will take care of the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That works only if you are using any public email service among the over 1000 supported providers, otherwise you'd have to enter the settings manually. Just make sure the phone is not in Offline mode, because ours wouldn't add new mailboxes unless we put in a SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one gripe we have with the email client on the Nokia E72 is the lack of threads. We know it's a Gmail thing, but it's a great feature. Maybe when other email service providers catch up, threads will get better support outside the Android world.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery: Eseries spelled with an N<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery is the same as the one found in Nseries phones and looks great. Thumbnails of images and videos are arranged in a horseshoe shape, with the currently selected image top center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll left or right and the speed of photo browsing increases if you press and hold the direction buttons on the D-pad. This makes a sort of circular scroller appear along with the month and year the picture was taken. This is great for quick skipping of tons of files if you're not in the habit of sorting out your memory card regularly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling in the gallery is also one of the places where the optical trackpad is put to good use. Getting to the next image with a sweep is effortless and makes for a true Nseries experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming is very speedy, thanks to the zippy 600MHz processor. It does slow down a bit when you get over 100% but it will go up to 400% zoom. Zooming is done in small increments (about 10%) and panning is quite fast too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery offers a nice slide show with customizable effects and delay between slides. You can also choose the direction of the slideshow - forward or backward from the currently selected photo and the track to go with it. Music can also be switched off if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery also has a very good picture tagging system. In addition to geotagging, which is automatically handled by the camera, you can add as many tags as you like to each photo and then use them as filters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the option to organize photos in Albums.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player: Symbian regular<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Full-featured music ability is not the main focus of a business device but the music player of the Nokia E72 is still pretty decent and we set our hopes for good audio quality high, knowing how recent Eseries devices performed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of dedicated music keys is easily overcome by the smooth D-pad control. There is a huge number of audio formats supported including MP3, AAC, eAAC+ and WMA. M3U playlists are also managed seamlessly and transferred files are added to the music library trouble-free by choosing the refresh option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Filtering tracks by artist, album, genre and composer is automatic and searching tracks by gradual typing is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with five equalizer presets, bass booster and stereo widening effect. You can also create new equalizer presets if the preloaded ones won't do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, being one of Nokia's best equipped phones, the Nokia E72 naturally also includes support for the A2DP Bluetooth profile, which allows listening to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is decent<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 features Real player for playing your video clips. The video player works in landscape mode only and that's hardly a surprise. Fullscreen mode is available of course. The softkey functions are hidden in full screen so they don't get in the way, and they only pop up when you touch the trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The relatively big landscape screen and the MP4 video clips support add up to a passable video watching experience but you will probably resort to another player anyway. The reason for this is quite simple - the E72 lacks DivX and XviD support out of the box. Luckily, finding applications for the S60 3.2 that support those codecs is a fairly easy task (though they can be paid).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 sports stereo FM radio with RDS, controlled by the well known radio app. Upon starting, the app asks about your location in order to set up the proper frequencies for your area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. Scanning for alternative frequencies when traveling can also be set to automatic. You can save up to 50 radio stations and the option to play music through the loudspeaker is available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here comes another musically-gifted member of the Eseries family. The Nokia E72 has great all-round perfomance that can make some dedicated music handsets jelous, let alone its business collegues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We told you that the E52 and E55 were the best performers in Nokia's business team as far as audio quality is concerned, but they didn't hold on to that title for long. Differences are not major as you can see from the table but the improvement in E72 is still visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Comparing the Nokia E72 to one of its market rivals - the BlackBerry Bold 9700 we notice striking resemblance between their results on most readings. If it wasn't for the BlackBerry's cut-off bass we would suspect that it is the same hardware inside those two. But in the end the better frequency response makes the E72 the winner in this contest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cutting to the point - here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera: very good 5 megapixel snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 means business even in the imaging department. While 5 megapixels are no longer high-end, it's more than enough for casual use, even for prints. The camera captures photos up to 2592 x 1944 pixels resolution and sports autofocus and an LED flash, which can be used as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera uses a nice tabbed interface and offers extensive settings: from manual white balance and ISO sensitivity to exposure compensation, sharpness and contrast settings, as well as various effects, which are labeled color tones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some changes to accommodate the optical trackpad and lack of a dedicated shutter key - touching the trackpad serves as a half-press, while pressing it all the way down actually takes the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs on the right can be displayed and hidden by pressing left or right on the D-pad. But while the tabs are visible you can't take a photo because pressing the center key activates the selected item in the tabbed menu. You get used to it, but it's annoying nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A gridline can also be applied to the viewfinder to assist you in framing you photos using the photographic rule of thirds. Using it to align your subjects and place points of interest on or near the lines and their intersecting points makes your photos more professional and aesthetic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sequence mode and self-timer are nothing new. The flash can be set to four positions: automatic, always on, red-eye reduction and always off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Small font tooltips are displayed to help you understand what the phone is doing at each specific moment (processing image, for example). You can also customize the toolbar deciding on shortcuts to display for which settings and in what order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, the option to activate geotagging is missing. It could be a Nokia 5800 type of deal, where geotagging was enabled through a firmware update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Nokia E72 is among the best 5MP snappers we've seen. The noise reduction is dialed back, which makes images a little noisy but the amount of captured detail is uncompromised. Contrast and color rendering are good, though images show a somewhat yellowish tint. This generally makes the colors warmer and more appealing though. The dynamic range is often not wide enough, which leads to loss of detail in the highlights and shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are some image samples so you can judge for yourself:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Nokia E72. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording on the E72 is not very impressive. The business-minded handset manages VGA videos at 15 fps, which is far from stellar but is certainly better than what E71 and E66 offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the recorded video is not very good and even if 15 fps is acceptable to you, the E72 is not a camcorder. The image quality is inadequate, mainly due to the heavy compression. Other than that, it renders some nice colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: A-list stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The E72 is truly on fire where data transfer is in question - it just has it all: from Bluetooth v2.0 and USB v2.0 to Wi-Fi and 3G. Furthermore, the 3G comes with HSPA support for the fastest network data transfers - up to 10.2Mbps downlink and 2Mbps uplink. That's the most recent Nokia radio module, which allows the E72 to as much as triple the data speeds of the E71.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>VoIP is a great addition to the call functionality of the E72, it even lets you make emergency calls if there's a Wi-Fi connection available and the cell network is down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microSD card slot is also on board, and easily accessible at the side of the phone. Because it's hot swappable, it might just be the quickest and most convenient way of transferring data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard 3.5mm audio jack is also there and the only thing missing that we can think of is TV-out functionality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser agrees with YouTube<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Browsing the internet on a Nokia smartphone is definitely a positive experience. The E72 is no exception with its excellent page rendering - most web pages look like they do on a desktop computer. The landscape orientation of the screen makes it much better at viewing pages not specifically designed for mobile devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual mouse cursor is easy to control and generally works well. The D-pad control here is enhanced by the optical trackpad, though it's not as good as we would have liked. Using the optical trackpad, the cursor jumps just as it does if you were using the D-pad, instead of moving smoothly. The jumps are equal in length too, so it's not very useful for scrolling either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A mini-map can be activated and it even appears automatically when you scroll longer, which helps you navigate complex websites without excessive scrolling. The zoom level is also easily adjustable at the expense of only a few key presses. The web browser also offers fullscreen view mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the usual key shortcuts, the browser in E72 offers a toolbar, which can be launched by pressing 1 or pressing and holding the center key on an empty area of the page. You can customize which shortcuts are on the toolbar - up to seven shortcuts like "Subscribe to feeds" or "Bookmark manager".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 browser features full Flash support. It handled many of the Flash sites we threw at it, but chocked on others (games most often).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash video is mostly not a problem for the E72 web browser - you can watch video on the full-featured version of YouTube, which worked without a hitch. With other video hosting sites though it's a hit or miss affair - for example, some of the videos on DailyMotion worked, but not all. Of the ones that worked, some lagged. Anyway, YouTube is guaranteed to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser is very zippy - panning is very fast, it easily loads pages over 1MB. One thing though - only the numeric keys are used as hardware shortcuts, but they are only a third of the whole keyboard. An option for assigning shortcuts to some of the letter keys would have sped things up a bit.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch PIM and Office 2007 support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As they say time is money, so time-management is another business phone virtue. There's no wonder then that the Nokia E72 has one of the most elaborate organizer packages we've seen. There are a lot of nice applications, all very user-friendly and functional.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - to-do, weekly, daily and agenda as well as five types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Meeting request, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. The only change from previous handsets is that things were rearranged slightly to work better with the landscape orientation of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The agenda view mode is really nice - it allows the dates of the month and the events for the selected day to appear simultaneously on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also duly covered, with seamless handling of Word, Excel and Powerpoint files. Furthermore, unlike most other Nokia handsets out there, editing documents is supported right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Nokia E72 you won't need to pay extra for editing your office documents. And there's another thing you get for free - support for Office 2007 documents (.docx, etc.)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A PDF reader is also part of the Nokia E72 preinstalled content and a ZIP manager allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other pre-bundled organizing and time-management applications are: a great unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. We are not going to get into detail with them, as their functionality and performance are familiar enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ActiveNotes application is also on board allowing multimedia content to be added to your notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 alarm clock application allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own name and start time. You can also customize the snooze time from the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The useful "Search" application is also at hand on the Nokia E72. Its reserved space in the active standby menu no longer comes as a surprise. After all, an application this useful really deserves to be conveniently placed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The application itself finds almost every item in your Nokia based on a given keyword. From messages to settings, every bit of data is checked and results are then listed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Nokia E72 features a dictionary. English comes preinstalled but you can also download dozens of other languages for free from the Nokia website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Traveler app helps you when visiting a new city - it'll offer weather forecast, a world clock, info on foreign currency, flights and even a 3D globe that marks your home and current location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the wireless presenter you can handle presentations straight from your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Multiscanner is a helpful looking app, which allows you to scan either business cards or text. It can't scan much text in one go though and the accuracy of the OCR is disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But wait, there?s more ? all the free stuff you can get from the Ovi Store. One of the more interesting apps is the Facebook app made specifically for Nokia E71 and E72. It?s great overall though it has a few kinks ? it doesn?t show any newly shared photos or videos in the News Feed or in fact posts with shared photos or videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, you can view all the shared media from your friends? profile pages and aside from that hitch the application works very well indeed. It?s a clever move from Nokia not to underestimate the importance of social networking in the business world ? Nokia, Microsoft, even the US president all have a Facebook page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS will lead the way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 comes complete with a built-in GPS receiver, A-GPS and Ovi Maps preinstalled. Voice-guided navigation comes at a price, however, you get 10 1-day drive licenses that come with the phone (must be used within 3 months after purchasing the handset) and walk navigation is completely free for the owners of E72.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The preinstalled version of the Ovi Maps is 3.0 and as usual it's pretty nice to work with. It has really detailed map coverage of a huge number of countries and a lot of extras such as traffic information, city guides and so on. Sadly, the extra features need to be purchased separately, as must the voice-guidance after the trial period has expired.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also has very decent looks and easily customizable route planning algorithms. Our favorite feature is the 3D view mode, which unfortunately has to be turned on every time you restart Maps - that's an odd one, no doubt about that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and simply use the phone as an electronic map. The nice thing about it is that you can actually preload the map content, so you don't need to access the wireless network to download that on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E72 also features a digital compass. In order for it to work, you need the map zoomed on your current GPS position. The compass (a magnetometer sensor) is turned on by default, but it doesn't work while turn-by-turn navigation is engaged. It's quite useful while making your way around on foot though, as it rotates the map to match even your slightest change of direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't fancy using Nokia Maps, you can opt for any of the numerous third-party applications available on the market, there's no shortage of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall impression of the Nokia E72 GPS functionality is very positive, with the chip sensitivity being very good. It takes about a minute to get a lock form cold start and about 10 seconds on AGPS. The whole experience out of the box is good enough for most users' needs and won't make too many people look for alternatives.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two classic timewasters<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E72 comes with two games preinstalled, both pastime classics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first one, called Block Cascade Fusion is a variety of Tetris, in which color also comes into play - instead of just making lines, you have to line up 5 or more blocks of the same color horizontally or vertically. The changes in the rules take some time getting used to - the lines of 5 or more same-color blocks disappear only during the fusion? blocks are dropping frantically, while you're trying to figure out what the point is. It is part of the fun, so we won't spoil it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other option is Top Hit Solitaires bringing 15 types of solitaire, with classics such as Klondike and Freecell (if you ever owned a PC you've played them).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There was a time when phones had cords and mail was delivered by hand. In comparison, the Nokia E72 seems like a space craft communicator. It handles just about every means of communication available today - from voice calls, through video calls, VoIP to texting, email and IM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So do a lot of other phones but there's a key difference. Most phones can handle email, but it's not necessarily an enjoyable experience. For the E72 email is second nature, as easy to use as making calls. It's not just the software or just the hardware, it's how they work together that makes for the excellent experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of hardware, the "cheap plastic syndrome" is the curse of some of the most capable smartphones. Blazing fast wireless connectivity won't make up for the cheapish looking plastic. But the Nokia E72 has the cure - metal - and it looks as good as it performs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Nokia E72 is king of the Eseries but whether it's the best choice for you is another matter. The Nokia E71 is still something to be reckoned with, though E72 brings a few important improvements, the chief of which is the upgraded camera (and probably the 600MHz CPU).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E55 offers just about the same software and the half-QWERTY doesn't lag too far behind the full keyboard of the E72 once you get used to it. But while the two phones are a match at build quality and centimeter-thin bodies, the E55 is compact and - more importantly - cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia E71 ? Nokia E55</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those who don't like Symbian will perhaps want to check out the WinMo alternatives by Samsung B7320 OmniaPRO and B7330 OmniaPRO duo. The B7330 especially is trying to come across as a Nokia E72 equal, so it will probably boil down to whether your current phone is running Symbian or Windows Mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're talking QWERTY messengers and there's always a BlackBerry Bold to try and spoil the day for Nokia. The BlackBerry Bold 9700 is sure hoping to be the E72 nemesis, just like the Bold 9000 was dogging the E71. Despite their recent dabbling in the popular phone market, BlackBerry phones are still the epitome of a business phone. And that sets them on a collision course with the Eseries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung B7320 OmniaPRO ? Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO ? BlackBerry Bold 9700</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Eseries have done it again. You can help yourself to another messenger of steel. The Nokia E72 won't be just the next in line though; it's keen to take the lead. It will be a while perhaps before Nokia decide to retire the E71, but they are making sure there won't be an empty space after it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the time being the E71 takes one step down the rank and continues to do its job. The E72 sees to it that the lineup is up to date. Nokia is betting on two horses in the QWERTY messenger race and everyone is happy. That includes us - users. Business as usual in the Eseries.</paragraph>
