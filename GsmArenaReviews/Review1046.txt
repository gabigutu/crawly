			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo is perhaps better known for its Blu-Ray players, but if the Find 5 fails to place it on the map as a phone maker, we don't know what will. The 5" 1080p screen will sure have plenty of eyeballs on it and its 441ppi density will certainly impress most, but the Find 5 has flagship specs almost all the way through - and we mean 2013 flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 is one of a series of Android phones we'll see this year to pack a 5" screen of 1080p resolution. Just like them, it has a powerful quad-core processor and a robust GPU - and neither is this a whim but a necessity (every frame on the screen has more than double the number of pixels of a 720p screen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo has taken a page from the Sony playbook and equipped the Find 5 with a 13MP camera capable of HDR video. The camera also jumps on the HFR bandwagon with a 120fps mode (though only at VGA resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find 5 is certainly an ambitious project and on paper it's pretty well executed - there's skill and character aplenty, though not without a few issues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The missing LTE is not quite the deal-breaker just yet, but it's a part of the future-proofing of a 2013 flagship. Non-expandable storage is another issue for a phone boasting a massive Full-HD screen and Dolby Mobile. If you get the 16GB version, you risk running short and quite quickly at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the up side, Oppo has done a very good job of the design - the Find 5 looks like it belongs to the Xperia NXT line (we mean that in a good way) and the steel frame gives the phone a sturdy feel. It is fairly thin at 8.9mm and the curved back makes it feel thinner still. It's got proper battery backup too - 2,500mAh is more than what many direct rivals typically have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may have come out of left field, but the Oppo Find 5 looks quite the player. Head over to the next page where the new signing is in for a physical.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Oppo Find 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 comes in cool black box with a highly stylized 5 on top. The box has two flaps on top that are firmly locked in place by a strong magnet. You swing those open to get to the Find 5 and its accessories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What you get in the box is a very compact charger, a microUSB cable to go with it and a single-piece headset. There's also a credit card sized piece of plastic with two NFC stickers on it and a bundle of manuals. The SIM eject pin is styled after the Oppo logo rather than having a generic design like we've seen elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First impressions are important and the well-designed, well-stuffed box gives the Oppo Find 5 the right sort of premium feel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 measures 141.8 x 68.8 x 8.9 mm, which is about the same height and width as the HTC Butterfly or the Sony Xperia Z, while the thickness is in between. At 165g, the Find 5 has quite some heft to it, but it's not unpleasant - it's evenly spread and gives the phone a solid feel. With that kind of weight the Find 5 is not the easiest smartphone to carry around, but we believe its powerful internals and juicy battery more than make up for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the Find 5 doing a pirouette:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 has bold angular styling with a few well-placed curves. These make the phone look even slimmer (not that 8.9mm is particularly thick to begin wtih) and improve the in-hand feel. We also like the contrast between the black glass and the matte white body. The handset is designed so that the screen is set within an L-shaped case, and the resulting white chin is a very nice accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen bezels are quite thin at the sides, helping minimize the size of the smartphone. The top bezel is wider to accommodate the earpiece, front-facing camera and sensors, as well as a status indicator that blinks upon missed events, low battery or charging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's somewhat more bezel at the bottom and that's good because it gives the capacitive keys enough room and the white chin improves things both visually and in terms of getting a secure hold (there's a place for your thumb to rest on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There'll be more on the screen coming up - a display like this deserves a chapter of its own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The straight cut sides of the phone are reinforced by a steel frame that Oppo is quite proud of. Taking 4 hours and 12 different processes to manufacture, it makes the phone extra sturdy, though obviously adding to the weight. The left side features the Power/Lock key and the microSIM card tray.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right is the volume rocker. The keys are narrow and not very comfortable to press; their sharp edges don't help either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the phone is a microUSB port and the mic pinhole. On top is the 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Oppo Find 5 is made of a white plastic with soft brushed finish. The 13MP camera and dual-LED flash are within a steel-like plate, with the secondary mic just off to the side. The camera placement isn't ideal: the phone rests right on it and it's very near the top edge, making it easy to cover with a finger while shooting or leave a fingerprint.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the opposite side of the back is the loudspeaker grille and a tiny nub that raises the phone ever so slightly, to give the speaker some room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel cannot be removed, but under it is the 2,500mAh battery. We're running our traditional battery tests and should have the results soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: The results are in - the Oppo Find 5 scored an endurance rating of 43 hours. It did pretty well when it comes to talking, but once that big screen comes on, the battery is put under a noticeably bigger strain. The HTC DROID DNA - another phone with 5" 1080p screen and Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset - scored 49h endurance and lasted longer when browsing the web or watching videos. You can learn more about how we do battery tests here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the Oppo Find 5 is a positive experience - our hands have gotten used to big phones with the unrelenting growth of the Androids and the subtly curved back fits well into the palm. The rounded corners are appreciated too, if they were pointier they would have been uncomfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone feels solidly built too, that steel frame certainly gives it stability. We do have one complaint though - pressing the screen glass at the bottom (where the capacitive keys are) causes it to push against the screen, producing a ripple effect. It's not a big problem, but it does raise some concerns.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo is using a 5" IPS LCD screen for the Find 5, protected by Gorilla Glass 2. The defining feature is the 441ppi pixel density, which is the highest we've seen on a mobile device yet (by some distance too). To achieve this density, the screen has 1080p resolution - 1920 x 1080. Yes that's the same number of pixels most HDTVs have, except this time they fit on a surface about 100 times smaller in size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image on the screen appears very close to the glass, which always looks good and combined with the very high pixel density it gives the impression of high-quality print rather than a screen. Individual pixels meld together and even very tiny text remains smooth. Here's what the screen looks like under a microscope (just about the only way to see pixels).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The difference between the 441ppi screen and a 300+ ppi screens can be seen, though it's not nearly as big as when phones broke the 300ppi barrier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IPS tech does its intended job well and gives the screen excellent viewing angles - there's color shift only at extreme angles and contrast loss is only observed when looking from the side and from a 45 degree angle - the IPS screens' typical Achilles heel. Since no one is going to look at their screen from that angle though, the viewing angles are perfect for all purposes practical. The screen has vibrant colors too and very good contrast, with pretty good levels of black.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has fairly low reflectivity, which helps the sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One last thing - we got a unit from the first batch of Find 5's to be shipped and the screen had a dead pixel. It's almost too small to see, but if you know where to look you'll see a tiny black speck. There are reports of other Find 5's with dead pixels, so we thought a warning is due.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface with ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean with plenty of custom touches to it. Everything is rendered at 1080p resolution but thanks to Project Butter and the powerful Adreno 320 GPU, the running is extra smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the Find 5 flaunting its UI on video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo has included high-resolution images to take full advantage of the pixel density and they look great. In terms of detail, that is, the candy-colored icons may not be to everyone's taste. Not all apps however, have icons optimized for such high resolution yet (even most tablets don't have that many pixels), so some get upscaled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That makes them look softer, but the pixel density is so high that they still look good, although clearly lacking the level of detail of the bespoke icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, Oppo has swapped out the lockscreen with its own. Actually there are two lockscreens out of box (each with an alternative view). The default one is the simple swipe-to-unlock kind and dedicates most of the screen real estate to the wallpaper. An optional charging status widget is all there is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second option is a reskinned Gingerbread lockscreen with two slides for unlock and mute. A battery charging widget can be enabled for this one too. There're no shortcuts on either lockscreen - just notifications such as missed calls or incoming messages. There're music controls available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a hidden flashlight shortcut - a press and hold of the Home button turns on the dual-LED flash. It goes out when you let go of the Home button. Note that you have to wake the screen for this to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen too is a custom job. Oddly, Oppo has opted to use huge icons - the screen fits a 4x5 grid, only 20 icons total, which is less than some phones with smaller screens offer. Keep in mind that we're talking about a 5" screen here, so 5% of that going to a single icon is huge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We installed the Nova launcher with its custom settings for the homescreen grid and we found that six icons on a row was a reasonably comfortable layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the up side, you can add up to 9 homescreen panes, when most custom launchers top out at 7 (the stock Android one is fixed at 5). You can re-arrange them and delete the ones you don't need, through the popular overview mode you enter with a pinch out gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has received a line of quick toggles. A tap on the edit button lets you hide/show toggles and rearrange them. If you have more than the screen can hold, the rest go offscreen and you need to scroll to reach them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a brightness control that toggles low, half, full brightness and auto mode. There's also a Kill all apps button. A long press on a toggle will bring up its respective settings entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the screen is a dock. You can have any shortcuts or folders you like here - you can even move the app drawer shortcut (but not remove it from the dock). The dock has four shortcuts (Dialer, Messaging, App drawer and Camera) by default, but you can actually fit a fifth one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is pretty simple - it has horizontally scrollable pages of 16 shortcuts or folders. The dock at the bottom of the screen is visible in the drawer too. A small "NEW" tag marks newly installed apps that haven't been launched yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dragging a shortcut to the homescreen doesn't work the way you're used to - the default action is to rearrange shortcuts, you have to drag it over the "Drag app to homescreen" area that appears at the bottom instead. This just slows down the most commonly used function - dragging shortcuts onto the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no widgets in the drawer, those are pulled out of a separate drawer on the homescreen. This looks a lot like early versions of TouchWiz. Oppo has included a set of custom widgets, which look like deformed bubbles, and are not very attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switcher is yet another element of Android that Oppo has customized. As with the other customizations, this one isn't very space efficient. It shows thumbnails of the running apps, three at a time, and you can dismiss apps by swiping them away. The switcher uses only half the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the cards is an indicator of how much RAM is used and there's another button to kill running apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even the Settings have been tweaked. They got a new paint job to match the rest of the UI and the various settings have been organized into tabs. Tabs have been used in several other places in the UI and once we got used to it, we found it to be a pretty nice solution for avoiding too long cluttered lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the interface on the Oppo Find 5 is fast and smooth. It's fairly functional too - the customizable toggles in the notification area are nice and the homescreen can be tweaked to your liking too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing could have made better use of the available space though - it can fit very few icons on the huge screen and things like dragging a shortcut out of the app drawer are needlessly complicated. Oppo has included a launcher switcher in the settings, so you can easily try out third party launchers if this one isn't to your liking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There were a few crashes, however. They didn't happen too often, but still more often than we are used to and Oppo should work on those. The Chinese assured us that these issues are due to the not completely finalized software and they will be resolved before the smartphone hits retail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, so it offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One problem Google Now has on the Oppo Find 5 is that there's no shortcut to launch it - you can't long press a button for it, just about the only way is to use the Google search widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 uses a Snapdragon APQ8064 S4 Pro chipset, which is the fastest to currently power an Android phone. It packs four Krait CPU cores clocked at 1.5GHz, 2GB of RAM and Adreno 320 GPU. That same chipset ticks inside the Google Nexus 4, the LG Optimus G, HTC DROID DNA / Butterfly and the Sony Xperia Z / ZL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Krait cores are fast, no doubt about that - two of them were coming only slightly short of a quad-core Cortex-A9 CPU and four make up a real beast. And the Oppo Find 5 doesn't disappoint. It comes up on top in Benchmark Pi (which is all about single-threaded performance) and it's very near the top in Linpack (which focuses on multithreading, though we do have some reservations about the accuracy of this benchmark).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It scores higher than the rest in the compound benchmark AnTuTu and is in the Quadrant Top 3 (also a compound benchmark).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We run GLBenchmark off-screen, which means we're testing at a fixed resolution, regardless of the screen resolution (it's 720p for v2.1 and 1080p for v2.5). This gives us the raw GPU power (games can choose to render at a lower resolution, with higher quality effects and then upscale to the screen resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the GLBenchmark 2.1 the Oppo Find 5 failed to impress - it posted the same score as the Nexus 4. Things get a lot better at the Oppo Find 5's native resolution of 1080, where it topped out the chart, beating both the LG Optimus G and the iPhone 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.1 Egypt (720p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But most games will probably want to run at native resolution, so we're including Epic Citadel, which uses Unreal Engine 3. Unreal Engine is popular with mobile game makers, so we'll be seeing this very engine in actual games. The benchmarks were run at native resolution and High Quality setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here, the Find 5 didn't do too well, but it's at a massive resolution disadvantage - it has to render more than twice as many pixels as phones with 720p screens. The big surprise here was the Galaxy S III, which is barely ahead despite the lower resolution. Mali-400 is getting old now, debuting on the Galaxy S II and even its overclocked Galaxy S III version is unable to match the newer architecture.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things were going very well for the Oppo Find, but the browser benchmarks clipped its wings. SunSpider was a dog slow 2045ms - more than twice as slow as the best of the bunch. The Nexus 4 doesn't do too well here either - unlike its desktop counterpart, Chrome for Android just isn't very good at this test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In BrowserMark 2 things started to look up again - the scores are still behind the LG Optimus G, which has the same chipset but less screen resolution (so, each time the phone redraws a web page, there's less than half the number of pixels to deal with). Vellamo shows similar results.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>To sum things up, the four Krait cores offer top notch performance, there's nothing that can beat them in the Android phone world (Cortex-A15 might, but we are yet to see if big.LITTLE will help it get into a power envelope suitable for phones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 320 GPU does equally well - it manages playable framerates using a real-world 3D engine at FullHD resolution. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 can only wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's Chrome that drops the ball - the stock Android Browser is consistently faster, especially with some tweaks from phone makers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook and dialer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook uses a tabbed interface, not unlike the stock phonebook. The first tab is the dialer, then there's the contact list, groups and favorites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer does smart dial (looking up both names and phone numbers). The button at the bottom left lets you quickly save the number you've typed in to a new or existing contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the call settings you can tweak a number of things. One is Notify on connect - the phone can vibrate or ring (or both) when a call connects. You can also build a list of texts to send when you decline a call. Flip to mute calls is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker of the Oppo Find 5 scored a good mark - combined with a strong vibration, you shouldn't miss any calls. You can read more about the loudspeaker test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook itself is pretty standard, save for the custom paintjob. It shows an alphabetized list of visible contacts with an alphabet index on the right if you want to jump to a specific letter (regular search is available too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on a contact's photo brings out Quick contacts - shortcuts for calling, texting, emailing a contact and a bit more (e.g. a Chrome shortcut to visit their web site).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact info is displayed as a list of all available details. A star next to the contact's photo and name can be used to mark them as favorite and there are call and text shortcuts at the bottom. Custom ringtones can be selected for each contact and duplicate contacts can be merged into a single entry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Earlier, we said visible contacts because you can hide contacts with no phone numbers or contacts from specific groups (e.g. ones that were synced from a specific email service).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact syncing tools are very powerful - contacts can be moved or copied between phone storage and a Google account, they can be synced with an Exchange server or Facebook, and you can send / import contacts over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department is pretty standard - there's a list of all conversations organized into threads, with two buttons at the bottom (Search and Compose).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each conversation consists of messages displayed in speech bubbles, similar to a chat program. It's a bit annoying that the compose box starts off as a single line, but it will grow to up to twelve as you type in more text. A character/message counter shows up when you're 10 letters away from the 140 limit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Attaching multimedia to a message will turn it into an MMS. You can add everything from photos, videos, audio to general files. There's even a full blown slide editor if you want to make full use of the MMS standard. The Attach location option is pretty nice too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Individual messages can be locked to prevent accidental deletion. Delivery reports can be activated and you can backup and import messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numbers can be added to a black list. Scheduled messages are also an option - you enter the recipient, message text and pick a date in the future. Messages can even be sent daily or only on select days (good if you need to message an automated service every day, e.g. for parking).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app has handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen and supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. Unfortunately, that part kept crashing on us, so we couldn't test it properly. There's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here, but there are two arrow buttons for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The big 5" screen offers a big on-screen keyboard and there's still plenty left over for the app. Keys on the keyboard get even bigger when you switch to landscape mode - the wide screen is remarkably comfortable for two-thumb typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use offline voice typing as an alternative too, one of the perks of using 4.1 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a "handle" attached to the text cursor - it's easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A double tap will bring up the select options - select word and select all - with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case of a typo, it will be underlined in red and when you tap it, the phone will offer a number of suggested corrections along with options to add the word to the phone's dictionary or just delete the word. The auto-suggest system will offer up the names of your contacts too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery on the Oppo Find 5 is a custom job, with less features than the vanilla app. The default view is a grid of folders, with a name and number of images for each folder labeled underneath. You can hide folders you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't filter apps by location, time, people or tags like you would in the stock app. There's no web album integration either (so, no "Make available offline" option).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images inside folders are arranged on a rectangular grid and you have two options - launch camera and start a slideshow. You can select multiple images (folders too) and then Share and Delete options become available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing an individual image, you can swipe left and right to navigate between images. You can zoom out to a strip of images (3 at a time), which makes browsing faster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The available features here are pretty standard - set image as wallpaper/contact image, share it delete it or get a menu with more functions. Those include rotation, cropping, renaming and viewing details. The details offer more info than most other galleries, including EXIF info (things like focal length, aperture, ISO, shutter speed, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a more advanced editor too. Light adjustments let you bring out the shadows or the highlights, you can apply effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the intensity of the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with a capable file manager out of the box. Its interface is laid out over two tabs, the first one organizes files by category, while the second is a traditional folder browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Files and folders can be copied, moved, deleted, renamed and compressed to ZIP (and ZIP files can be extracted). Batch operations are supported. The folder browser has list and grid views and you can change the sorting method. The system can be encrypted and password protected too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser also has built in DLNA and FTP servers, which makes it easy to access multimedia and general files on another device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Dolby Mobile and Dirac<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Find 5 comes with a bespoke music player that Oppo loaded with some impressive sound tech. There's both Dolby Mobile and Dirac HD sound enhancements available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI is pretty straightforward - your music library is organized into a list of all music, a list of artists, folders and playlists. A cool feature is the small file filter, which will keep out non-music audio files (e.g. some SatNav apps have pre-recorded words for voice-guided navigation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface is split into two - the current playlist and the album art/music controls screen. You can swipe between the two. By default the player will look for lyrics and display them over the album art. You can add album art if it's not available (but the player won't look for it automatically).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a playback mode button (normal, shuffle, repeat track) and a toggle for audio enhancement. That cycles through Off, Dolby and Dirac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dolby Mobile effects include Surround sound (headphones only), Natural bass and Treble, along with an equalizer with multiple presets including a custom one. Dirac has no options, it's either on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, the music player successfully played a 16-bit FLAC file (24-bit didn't work).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is on, the lockscreen features the album art and track info for the current song along with the basic playback controls. The notification area also lets you control the playback via an expandable notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music is preloaded on the Oppo Find 5 if you prefer that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player with basic codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is pretty basic - it supports MP4 files (along with a few old containers like ASF), but no AVI or MKV. It has no problems playing 1080p videos in the supported formats, which is good, but you are always likely to need a 3rd party alternative to avoid the converting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface for video selection is pretty basic too - a list of all available files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player has the exact same audio enhancing capabilities as the music player - Dolby and Dirac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player supports subtitles too, but there's only an on/off toggle here, you can't manually pick the subtitle file (so it would have to have the same name as the video file to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A feature that seems lifted right off the Samsung Galaxy flagships is the pop-up player. It's a small floating window that lets you have other apps working underneath. You can move it around to get it out of the way, but there's no resize option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to play the video on your TV, you can activate the Wi-Fi Display function, but you'll need a compatible HDMI dongle. There's no MHL TV-Out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is reasonably loud and decently clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 did pretty well in our audio quality test, showing good volume levels in both parts and nicely clean output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you use the smartphone with an active external amplifier you get good scores just about every where. The frequency response was spot-on for the most part of the audible range, but the extreme treble frequencies, where it deviates a bit. The volume levels were well above average, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The increase in stereo crosstalk when you plug in a pair of headphones, but the good news is none of the other readings are affected. Volume levels remain very good too, so it's a solid overall performance that should easily please everyone but the most demanding audiophiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>13MP camera sounds better than it actually is<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo equipped the Find 5 with a 13MP camera that captures stills at up to 4308 x 3120 resolution. It uses a 1/3.06" CMOS sensor and pretty bright F/2.2 aperture. There's dual-LED flash to help out with low-light shots and a 1.9MP front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface has been polished up a bit though nothing too fancy - two control sidebars in the viewfinder, the right one holding the still/video toggle, virtual shutter and gallery shortcut, while the left one is for settings. The 4.1 JB way to access recently snapped photos - a left swipe - is available, but you can't swipe up to delete photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls on the left include a back/front cam switch, flash, HDR mode and extended settings. The extra settings don't offer much - resolution, self-timer, sound, face detection, geotagging and gridline is all you get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's touch focus available and an always-on burst shot mode, so you can't long press the virtual shutter key to focus, but Oppo is promising 20fps burst shot mode. The volume buttons can act as a shutter key each, digital zoom is handled by a pinch gesture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the Oppo Find 5 does decently, though we wouldn't pick it over the best 8MP shooters. Resolution is good, if unspectacular, but images are peppered with color noise, which brings down the captured detail. Colors are accurate, but the dynamic range is not very wide (resulting in blown out highlights). Purple fringing can be seen near high-contrast edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode is available, but it's not the best implementation we have seen. It doesn't capture more detail in the shadows and the advantage in the highlights is not great. However Oppo chose to use a very flat tonal curve, which results in low contrast, despite the modest gain in dynamic range. Also, the noise transforms into oversharpened monochromatic noise, making it all the more visible. Colors get the over-done HDR look and a yellowish tint. Overall, we'd recommend against using HDR as it feels like a software tweak, rather than the result of actually combining two images.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 is one of the few 13MP shooters in our Photo Compare Tool, but the LG Optimus G and Sony Xperia T are there to meet it. Also, try it out against some 8MP shooters by using the downscale feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo did pretty well on the ISO chart, but it really prefers that there's a lot of light. Also, there is a slight tint near the center of the image.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is virtually identical to the still camera UI. The only difference is that the HDR mode shortcut is replaced by a resolution and mode shortcut, while the HDR mode shortcut goes in the extra settings menu. There's no touch focus or face detection, though continuous autofocus works. There's 4x digital zoom for all resolutions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot at up to 1080p and 30fps and stored in MP4 files with 12Mbps bitrate. Sound is recorded in stereo at 96Kbps and 48kHz. Both bitrates are on the low side of quality video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results aren't very impressive - videos look soft after the compression takes out most of the fine detail and there's still the problem of blown out highlights. There's some purple fringing noticeable near high-contrast edges. On the up side, videos are smooth, colors are accurate and the continuous autofocus isn't too aggressive (it actually comes across as a bit too sluggish).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are two 1080p video samples - one with HDR off and one with HDR on:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download an untouched video here - 1080p@30fps (0:08s, 12MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode is also available for videos (Anything to say, Sony Xperia Z?) and it still messes up the colors, but is actually a lot better than the still image HDR. It keeps the contrast and actually manages to bring in detail in both the highlights and the shadows. There's no resulting extra noise either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we would consider using HDR in video mode, we just wish there was a way to tone down the color saturation in the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 has more video-related tricks up its sleeve - VGA recording @ 120fps comes in two flavors. The first plays back videos at 30fps, a 4x slow-mo mode, while the other leaves the video at the full 120fps, a High Framerate mode (HFR), think The Hobbit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, The Hobbit was played at only 48fps and even Avatar 2 will be shot at just 60fps, so 120fps is a bit over the top. Especially when you consider that the HDMI standard tops out at 60fps and so do most monitors and mobile screens (DVI does support 120fps). YouTube wouldn't even work with 60fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You wouldn't need HDMI anyway, the practical resolution of the videos is well below even VGA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a slow-mo video sample. You can also download this 120fps HFR video (0:06s, 7.9MB).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike the 13MP resolution of the still camera, the 1080p of the video camera is a pretty popular format. Here's how the Oppo Find 5 does against the competition.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity with NFC and Wi-Fi display, but no LTE<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 has quad-band 2G and tri or four-band 3G connectivity (depending on the market) with HSPA+. The big omission here is LTE - that might be a deal breaker for some, but a lot of places still don't have LTE coverage and for them it wouldn't matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is handled by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no dedicated app to handle NFC tasks, you do that from the Settings instead. NFC can be used for standard Android Beam (data transfer happens over Bluetooth) or Oppo Lightning transmission, which is faster but works only between two Oppo devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC can be used to automate actions with NFC tags too - here's where the two NFC stickers in the box come into play. The OppoTag software has five presets that can be used - Home, Bedroom, Office, WLAN display and Application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each one can be set to perform a predefined list of functions. Each preset controls different settings (e.g. Office can enable silent and launch Notes, while Bedroom can switch off wireless connectivity options). Settings can usually be turned on or off if you want to modify the behavior of a preset, but not all setting and you can't add new settings to the preset or create custom presets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can write to the NFC tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 also has a Wi-Fi display option, which can output the screen image to a compatible device over HDMI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wired connectivity includes a microUSB port for data transfers and charging (but there's no MHL functionality here) and a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. The minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop button next to tabs and settings. You can switch between tabs with a wide horizontal swipe in either direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi range, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's deeper settings, you'll also have the option to turn the auto-fill of forms and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo has thoughtfully preloaded Flash player on the Find 5, but the problem is that Chrome doesn't support external plug-ins (the stock Browser does). So, it's useless as-is, but you can always install a third party browser or even find the APK for the stock Browser.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer with Office doc editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 comes with QuickOffice out of the box and it's the full version that can create and edit files too. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint files (97, 2007 and 2010 docs are supported) and can view PDFs too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editors are quite capable - the Word editor can do complex text formatting, create tables, while the Excel editor has full support for editing formulas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has iOS looks with a leather accent on top, and is pretty functional at that. There are four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar and you can selectively hide calendars to keep things tidy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own repeat time, ring tone, volume, snooze interval and note. The app also offers a world clock, a stop watch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator is a just a skinned version of the stock app - it has big, easily thumbable keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The NearMe Notes app comes pre-installed. The app lets you create complex notes with text, images and hand drawn notes. The gimmick here is that each note has a location associated with it and only notes that are "close by" will be displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tools folder is preloaded with a few apps that you usually get from the market. There's a Flashlight app (that's virtually identical to the HTC app), a sound recorder and a 3D compass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another useful app here is the System update app, which can be used to update the phone's software over the air or from a local file (a ZIP saved in the internal memory).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 5 comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start (it supports GLONASS for faster, more accurate locks too). You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Luckily for the Oppo Find 5, Android is very flexible about resolution and you get full access to the Play Store. With the Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset you'll be able to run even heavy games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Oppo doesn't have a history in phones, but you'd never tell just by looking at the Find 5. It's a beautiful device with killer specs and, better still, it's priced lower than the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really liked the screen of the Find 5 - the phone carries the 5-incher well and the 1080p resolution (plus things like great viewing angles and that coveted laminated look) make for an amazing picture. However, we worry about the screen glass (it doesn't seem particularly tough) and the dead pixel is another issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the jump from 300+ ppi to 400+ ppi pixel density isn't as spectacular as the first "Retina" displays were, but that's a problem shared by all 5" 1080p flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, beyond that the Oppo Find 5 seems to get most things right - the Snapdragon S4 Pro chipset offers plenty of processing power (enough to handle the resolution), the 13MP camera is good if not great (plus movie HDR is a very rare feature), there's good battery backup (2,500mAh), NFC, Dolby Mobile and a recent enough version of Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it gets things wrong too - the Android skin won't be to everyone's liking, there's no LTE, the battery, big as it is, is not removable and there's no way to expand the external storage. This is pushing you towards the $70 more expensive 32GB version if you want to store movies, games and a decent audio collection (and you will want that with a gorgeous screen like that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Oppo Find 5 will retail for $500 (16GB) / $570 (32GB), which is less than many 16GB smartphones go for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that there are many - the HTC DROID DNA is $600 (without a Verizon contract), but the international version, the Butterfly is hard to find and costs even more. The battery is smaller (by a good 500 mAh), the camera is "just" 8MP and there's only a 16GB version (though the Butterfly does have a microSD card slot). Both versions have LTE, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC DROID DNA ? HTC Butterfly</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there is Sony's flagship - the Xperia Z / ZL. The two differ more than the DROID DNA / Butterfly. Both have 13MP cameras, LTE, expandable storage and 2,330mAh batteries. But the Xperia Z is thin and waterproof, while the Xperia ZL is thicker but with a smaller footprint. But they're not cheap - and most countries won't get a choice between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Xperia Z ? Sony Xperia ZL</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 720p resolution, 4.7-4.8 inch screens aren't that far behind in image sharpness (blame your flesh and blood eyes for not having enough resolution) and they're not much smaller either. This means you can look at the Google Nexus 4 (if you can get it from the Play Store), the HTC One X+ and the Samsung Galax S III. And if it's a big screen you want, there's always the Galaxy Note II, but its screen's pixel density doesn't even come close to that of the Oppo Find 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG Nexus 4 E960 ? HTC One X+ ? Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III ? Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It seems inevitable that sooner or later we'll all be buying a phone from a previously little known company from China - be it ZTE, Huawei or Oppo. They're getting just too good and come at very competitive price points. The Oppo Find 5 is a great place to start - it has everything you can expect to get in a flagship Android phone. Flaws included, but generously outweighed by good stuff.</paragraph>
