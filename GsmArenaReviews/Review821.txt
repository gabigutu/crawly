			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We intentionally delayed this edition of our phone shopping guide, waiting for all flagships to come out. With the last one out and reviewed, time to see how the market evolved since our last edition in March.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flagships define the upper bound and push everything below them down in price, especially last year's flagships. They certainly improve on last year's offerings but it's open for debate if they offer enough to justify their fresh flagship price tags or if their predecessors offer the better value after the price cut they took.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Curiously, the ?100-?200 segment proved the most hotly disputed. This is because the Motorola Moto G redefined what you can get for ?200 and plenty of lesser-spec'd devices suddenly look overpriced. The Moto G has come down in price and got a new sibling, the Moto E, which stirred things up even further when it comes to affordable quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We sort phones by price segment but inadvertently ended up with most devices falling into use-case categories. Here are the price categories, followed by brief explanations of what to expect there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sub-?100 gets your foot in the door of smartphone functionality (feature phones over ?30 are not worth it anymore). These phones won't offer you much comfort or quality, but they get the job done. Depending on timing, some higher-up phones fall into this category with temporary promotions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?100-?200 segment proved very fruitful with phones moving beyond basic functionality. They have good screens (some 720p), good cameras (several 8MP / 1080p shooters can now be found under ?200) and even good chipsets with quad-core processors running an up-to-date OS. Even LTE is no longer out of reach in this category.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?200-?300 category is where things start to specialize. There are phablets, a mini and even a handful of high-end phones barely a year old. This is what we meant - with sub-?200 phones being this good, a ?200+ device must offer something special to make it worth your hard-earned cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?300-?400 segment is like the last one but in overdrive. Virtually all 2013 flagships are here as well as a number of powerful phablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ?400-?500 price range has only a few phones worth your bucks, mostly the flagship phablets that came out late last year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, ?500 gets you a brand new flagship phone that was announced just months ago with all the cutting edge technology under its hood. It's how the release cycle has shaped the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flagship phones come out early in the year and drop noticeably in price by the same time next year (when their replacements come out). Phablets meanwhile typically launch in the second half of the year as a sort of flagship plus after the buzz of the phones have died off. Thus phablets are fairly new and have dropped to halfway between 2013 and 2014 flagship phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that this smartphone shopping guide is intended for an international audience and we've omitted phones that are highly regional. We have included a couple of offers of a fairly limited availability, but those were just too good to pass up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can read the guide page by page or just to a price category within your budget. Also check the conclusion for more info on why we chose what we chose and why we skipped some phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Under ?100<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Soon after we started writing our shopping guides we gave up on feature phones - it's hard to recommend one when there's a old, cheap smartphone at the same price. A smartphone OS means you get more functionality and can actually save money - something like Viber or Skype can handle free messages and calls, while a navigation app can replace a dedicated SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that all phones listed here have 3G connectivity and they typically have microSD card slots too (unless otherwise noted). We'll only be listing the standout features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our penny-pincher offer is the Samsung Galaxy Pocket Neo. It has just enough hardware to get you in the game - a 3" QVGA (240 x 320) screen, 850MHz processor and 512MB RAM. It runs a relatively recent version OS, Android 4.1 Jelly Bean and has 4GB of built-in storage so you can actually install multiple apps. Some cheap offerings of the past came with only 512MB storage, which ran out very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 2MP camera with QVGA video capture is barely there, but a similarly priced Nokia Asha won't have much better. But with a feature phone you won't get Google Maps for offline navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thrifty shoppers know that some relatively small local brands can be real gems. Europe-based Wiko offers phones like the Ozzy, which has a sharper 3.5" HVGA screen (320 x 480) and a much faster dual-core Corex-A7 processor at 1GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wiko Ozzy runs a slightly newer version of Android (4.2 Jelly Bean) and is a dual-SIM phone (that's an option on the Pocket Neo). The camera department is better too, the 2MP camera shoots 864 x 480 video and there's a VGA front-facing camera to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG L40 bears a more recognizable brand name for a slightly higher price tag. It deserves every penny though, the 3.5" HVGA screen is an IPS LCD for better viewing angles and is protected by Gorilla Glass 2. The dual-core A7 processor is clocked at 1.2GHz and it runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, the main camera is a 3MP shooter. There's an LG L40 Dual for those who need dual-SIM connectivity, but we had troubles finding that version in stores so availability may be limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 520 has become a fixture of the "Under ?100" category. With good reason too, a 4" WVGA screen and dual-core Krait processor, which can't be matched for power in this price range. It's an IPS screen with scratch-resistant glass too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's also only one of two phones listed here that shoot 720p video, the 5MP camera is fairly good too. Some also enjoy the novelty of Windows Phone and don't forget about the free SatNav by HERE Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that the US the Nokia Lumia 520 can be found dirt cheap, while European promotions are more restrained but there are still great deals to be had.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto G is an alternative to the Nokia Lumia 520 if you find the right promotion. In the US it gets as low as $50, but don't expect anything close to that in other countries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it's one of the cheapest phones you can get with a 720p screen, a 4.5" IPS LCD with Gorilla Glass 3 no less. It also has a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor and a 5MP / 720p camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While it sounds like a proper dream phone, the promos are usually for the 8GB version, which we find way too limiting. At $50 we wouldn't even blink but for non-US residents we'll revisit the Moto G at a different price point with better storage.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?100-?200<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is officially the era of the "good enough" smartphone - a sub-?200 phone can handle all your daily needs, leaving more expensive gadgets for the more tech inclined. Bang for the buck is valued more than any individual feature (individual disadvantages too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony recently released the Xperia E1, but we still like the older Xperia M better. Both phones come in single and dual-SIM versions and have 4" WVGA screens, but the Xperia M wins in two important segments - camera and chipset - while costing virtually the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a dual-core Krait chipset with 1GB RAM and Adreno 305 versus a dual-core Cortex-A7 with 512MB RAM and Adreno 302. The camera is a 5MP / 720p shooter compared to the entry-level 3MP / WVGA camera of the Xperia E1, there's a front-facing camera to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one advantage the Xperia E1 holds over the M is that it's newer by half a year, meaning it's likely to get one more software update. However, at this point phones are running Android 4.3 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now under Lenovo management, Motorola is trying to replicate Moto G's success at the ?200 price point closer to ?100 with the Moto E. It has a slightly bigger, slightly sharper screen than the Xperia E1 - 4.3" qHD unit (so it's 256ppi over 233ppi for the Xperia). It's guarded by Gorilla Glass to boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is powered by the same chipset, but Motorola's close association (until recently) with Google means the Moto E runs Android 4.4 KitKat, plus you get 1GB of RAM. The camera is also better - a 5MP snapper that records FWVGA (a small difference in resolution but fits 16:9 screens better). The Motorola Moto E has a dual-SIM version as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 630 is not a direct successor to the Lumia 520, but the two aim for the same price segment. This is the first Windows Phone handset with a dual-SIM option, so if you felt locked in Android because you needed dual-SIM now is your time to jump ship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a relatively big screen, 4.5" IPS LCD, with relatively low resolution, FWVGA (that's 480 x 854). Still, Nokia's ClearBlack tech improves sunlight legibility and Gorilla Glass 3 will ward off scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 630 runs Windows Phone 8.1 on a quad-core processor (1.2GHz) but with only 512MB RAM. Still, like the 520 before it, the Lumia 630 will generally run faster than similarly priced Androids. It also has a better camera - a 5MP shooter with 720p video. And don't forget about the free offline navigation, this one for all countries Drive+ has maps for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up, a relatively unknown phone in the face of ZTE Grand S Flex. It has a 5" 720p IPS screen with near Retina sharpness. It also packs an 8MP camera with 1080p video, the cheapest FullHD shooter. It's also the cheapest LTE-enabled device in this guide and has a good 2,300mAh battery. The Grand S Flex is no speed freak with a dual-core Krait at 1.2GHz and it runs an aging Android 4.1 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Grand S Flex can give you a taste of an old flagship for little more than the Moto E costs. It might be hard to find though, as we said it's a relatively unknown device. And if you do find a unit, you only get 16GB storage and there's no microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid E2 Duo has been around for over a year and we've recommended it in past installments. Now it's perhaps even more relevant as it is a direct competitor to the Lumia 630.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a dual-SIM version and bests the Nokia entry-level device on several counts - the 4.5" IPS screen is sharper (qHD resolution), it has an 8MP / 1080p camera, stereo speakers and 1GB of RAM. It's powered by a similar chipset too, except made by MediaTek and running a relatively old OS version, Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, Acer may not get around to releasing further software updates for this one but the camera upgrade is fairly significant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If dual-SIM isn't a priority and the ZTE doesn't do it for you, the LG Optimus L9 II is a solid alternative. It has a slightly smaller 4.7" IPS screen with 720p resolution and a similar 8MP / 1080p camera. The runs a current Android 4.4.2 KitKat on a slightly faster chipset with a dual-core Krait CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus L9 II lacks LTE, which might or might not matter, but the connectivity feature set boasts NFC and an IR blaster to control tech at home. Plus, it has a microSD card slot so storage shouldn't be an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if dual-SIM is a priority as is a big screen, then the Sony Xperia C offers a 5" qHD screen (with an average 220ppi pixel density) and two microSIM slots. It's powered by a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor running the relatively old Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C has well-liked Sony looks and an 8MP / 1080p camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We promised to revisit the Moto G and here it is - Motorola recently released the Moto G 4G, an LTE-enabled version of its highly intereting mid-ranger. Better still, it has a microSD card slot, which was one of the more common complaints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You still get the goods - a sharp 4.5" 720p IPS screen with Gorilla Glass 2, a zippy quad-core Cortex-A7 processor, current Android version (4.4.2) and a 5MP / 20p camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've recommended the Sony Xperia SP in the past as an alternative to the Moto X, but it has come down in price noticeably. It has a 4.6" 720p screen with Gorilla Glass and is powered by a dual-core Krait processor, but it's paired with a powerful Adreno 320 GPU - the phones above typically use Adreno 305, an old PowerVR SGX or worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Xperia SP runs Android 4.3 Jelly Bean an update to 4.4 KitKat is in the works. It has an 8MP 1080p camera and LTE connectivity.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?200-?300<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For those who need more than "good enough" there's an intermediate steps, the ?200-?300 segment. Here you'll find some two year old flagships and the first phablets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that all recommended phones in this category have LTE so it no longer counts as a selling point and you won't see it in the Pros section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the lower price segments a large screen is usually considered a plus, but as we approach premium levels a compact device becomes hard to find. Enter the minis - the LG G2 mini is not quite the tiniest phone, but is still very compact for its 4.7" screen. It's an IPS LCD with qHD resolution (for an average 234ppi pixel density) with Gorilla Glass 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the G2 mini has a whopping four versions though you're likely to encounter just three as the third one is for Brazil only. Anyway, we've selected the LTE model but the non-LTE version has a dual-SIM option (the two are otherwise the same).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's powered by a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor and runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat. The camera is an 8MP / 1080p shooter and you get NFC and IR blaster in the connectivity section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, big screens aren't necessarily bad. The Nokia Lumia 1320 has a 6" IPS screen with 720p resolution - not the sharpest, but again ClearBlack is here to improve legibility in bright light. It's one of the two original Windows Phone tablets and is powered by a dual-core Krait processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera department features relatively low-res stills (5MP), but offers 1080p video recording. You get LTE, a long-lasting 3,400mAh battery and Nokia's free offline navigation with Drive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's two generations removed from current but the LG Optimus G is a cheap way to get decent specs - a 4.7" IPS LCD with WXGA resolution (768 x 1,280 pixels), quad-core Krait processor, 13MP / 1080p camera and LTE. It launched on Android 4.1 Jelly Bean but LG is working on an update to 4.4 KitKat - that one has started seeding in Korea, while other markets should follow soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 925 is in a way an alternative to the Optimus G. It has a 4.5" WXGA screen but it's an AMOLED with ClearBlack for excellent image quality. The 8MP / 1080p camera features Optical Image Stabilization, this is the lowest price at which you can get OIS. The camera also boasts Carl Zeiss optics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It runs Windows Phone upgradeable to 8.1 though the chipset is a relatively old Snapdragon with dual-core Krait and Adreno 225. Nokia's free SatNav app is a given. Windows Phone works well enough on the older chipset, so at the same price the exposed aluminum frame of the Lumia 925 might prove more alluring than the Optimus G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Acer Liquid S2 holds the title of first device with 2160p video capture and while others quickly joined in on the 2160p fun, it's still a solid phablet. Priced between the Lumia 1320 and 1520, it has a 6" IPS screen with 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still camera is a 13MP shooter with a unique LED ring flash. The Liquid S2 is powered by a beefy Snapdragon 800 chipset, one of the cheapest devices with it, but the Android version is lagging behind. It also has stereo speakers on board like the Liquid E2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oppo has a new exciting flagship, but the old Find 5 is still a solid choice. It has a quad-core Krait processor, though an older generation than the Acer above, but on the upside it's more compact with a 5" 1080p screen. Its 13MP camera shoots 1080p videos, which is all the same if you don' have a UHD display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?300-?400<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This price segment is above mass market smartphones and proved to be the home of practically all of last year's flagships. There are also a number of quality phablets to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z Ultra is a practically a tablet with its 6.4" 1080p screen. The screen can use a regular pencil as a stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device is a stunning 6.5mm thick and features Sony's attractive design, including the IP58 certification, which is now standard for flagship Xperias. This means you can dunk it in the pool to shoot photos and videos with its 8MP / 1080p camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z Ultra is powered by a beefy Snapdragon 800 chipset and runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat either with Sony's customizations or pure Google Play Edition software. The battery life could have been better though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A more manageable phablet is the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo with its 5.5" screen. It's a Super AMOLED unit of 720p resolution, so not as sharp as its premium namesake (267ppi). It does have an S Pen stylus though and the added productivity that comes with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It runs an older version of Android (4.3 Jelly Bean) on Samsung's Exynos 5260 Hexa chipset - it pairs two fast Cortex-A15 cores with four energy-efficient Cortex-A7s. The Galaxy Note 3 Neo has an 8MP / 1080p camera (with flash) on its faux leather back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another 5.5" phablet is the LG Optimus G Pro. It's older, but it has a 1080p IPS screen with Gorilla Glass 2 and a more traditional quad-core Krait 300 processor. It also has a 13MP camera with 1080p video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many have abandoned their point and shoot cameras since smartphones got so good at photography. Some are better than other and few - if any - are better than the Nokia Lumia 1020. It's not a particularly impressive handset for this price, but it has a monster camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The massive 1/1.5" sensor has 41MP resolution sits behind Carl Zeiss optics and is optically stabilized. The custom camera software allows for manual focus and you get powerful xenon flash. The camera normally shoots 5MP photos, which are more practical but also enable lossless digital zoom (it's available for video too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that you're essentially getting a Lumia 925, but the gap in cameras is well worth the ?100 price difference between the two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another phone with big camera credentials is a mini - the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is the only flagship mini that's both small and didn't get a massive reduction in specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its camera has a 1/2.3" 20.7MP sensor, but like the Lumia it only shoots 1080p video, it's not part of the elite 2160p club.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 Compact has a 4.3" IPS screen of 720p resolution, a powerful Snapdragon 800 chipset running Android 4.4 KitKat. The Sony doesn't have optical stabilization, but isn't afraid to wade water thanks to its IP58 certification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has a new darling, but truth be told the HTC One from last year is nearly as good at it. It certainly has the aluminum unibody appeal and front-facing stereo speakers, plus the same camera sensor but with image stabilization. It doesn't have the second camera on the back, but that's mostly for gimmicky effects anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is smaller than the 2013 norm, a 4.7" Super LCD3 with 1080p resolution. The chipset is a Snapdragon 600, slower than Snapdragon 800's but certainly no slouch. The HTC One runs Android 4.4 KitKat with either Sense 6 or pure Android in the Google Play Edition implementation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're okay with large phones, the full-sized Sony Xperia Z1 costs virtually the same as the Xperia Z1 Compact. It enhances the recipe with a bigger, sharper screen - 5" 1080p - and a bigger battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the same 1/2.3" 20.7MP sensor, Snapdragon 800 chipset and Android 4.4.2 KitKat software. The IP58 water resistance certification is in place too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 is a fine flagship, but Samsung quietly unveiled a small update, the I9506. It's essentially the same phone except it swaps the Snapdragon 600 chipset with a Snapdragon 800, offering better CPU and GPU performance and faster LTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a 5" 1080p screen and 13MP / 1080p camera, it serves as a budget version of the Galaxy S5. There are I9506 Galaxy S4 Black Editions out there with faux leather on the back similar to the Galaxy Note 3 (but different from the Galaxy S5 faux leather), which costs just a little more and those are the ones you should be looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've listed a few of Google Play Edition devices so far and there are more to come. Still, some users want Google to have more say in the design of a phone, not just the software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 5 by LG has 2013 flagship specs, including a 5" 1080p IPS screen, Snapdragon 800 chipset and an 8MP / 1080p camera with optical image stabilization. The phone packs other goodies like wireless charging and will be among the first to get new Android versions, at least for a little while longer (Google doesn't guarantee updates beyond 18 months after launch).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for another case of "you met the mini, now here's the big one." Unlike the Xperia Z1 pair though, the LG G2 has little in common with its mini - it was one of the most impressive phones to come out last year with razor thin bezels around its 5.2" 1080p IPS screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Consider this - the LG G2 is practically the same size as the HTC One, whose screen is half an inch smaller. The G2 is powered by a Snapdragon 800 chipset and runs Android 4.4 KitKat. It also has an impressive camera - an optically stabilized 13MP shooter with 1080p @ 60fps video capture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unusual design of putting the Power key and volume rocker on the central line of the back, just below the camera, has both its proponents and opponents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OnePlus One is made by the same people behind Oppo and the phablet is indeed quite similar to the Find 7a. It has the same 5.5" 1080p IPS screen, but is powered by a better chipset - both have Snapdragon 801 chipsets but the OnePlus One uses the AC version (with 2.5GHz CPU clockspeed) and 3GB RAM vs. 2GB. Also, the One runs a special version of CyanogenMod, which is close to stock Android 4.4 KitKat, while the Find 7a runs Color OS based on Android 4.3 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OnePlus One has the same 13MP camera with 2160p video capture. You do lose the microSD card slot and the base storage is just 16GB, so we recommend you shell out ?50 extra for the 64GB version. This puts it at the same price as a 16GB Find 7a.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Oppo Find 7a is the replacement of the Find 5. Its 1080p screen grew to 5.5" and the Snapdragon chipset was updated to Snapdragon 801. Another noticeable updated is that the 13MP camera can now capture 2160p video, plus you get a microSD card slot to handle the increased storage demands. The camera also has a special mode that combines several shots into a 50MP image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It runs a heavily customized version of Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, which won't be everyone's cup of tea. By the way, there's another version on the way called just Find 7, which offers a QHD screen - that's 1,440 x 2,560 - if 1080p isn't enough.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>&#x20ac;400-&#x20ac;500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't intend it this way but the &#x20ac;400-&#x20ac;500 category is the domain of flagship phablets. Flagship smartphones are still over &#x20ac;500, while non-flagships have dropped below &#x20ac;400, so here come three large phablets with 1080p screens and Snapdragon 800 chipsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 1320 is nice, but for a proper flagship experience you'll need the Nokia Lumia 1520. Its 6" screen has more than double the number of pixels (1080p resolution) and the chipset inside is the much more potent Snapdragon 800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It uses Nokia's latest PureView camera - a fairly big 1/2.5" sensor with 20MP. It's optically stabilized and uses Carl Zeiss optics and while there's no xenon flash like on the Lumia 1020, at least it has a dual-LED flash. You get the same camera app with manual controls too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 1520 is currently the Windows Phone device that comes closest to Android flagships, but is fairly large. The Lumia 930 (due to launch later this month) will offer the same features in a 5" package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the Lumia 1320/1520 pair, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 shares similarities with the Galaxy Note 3 Neo but improves on it on just about every level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a bigger, sharper 5.7" 1080p Super AMOLED screen with an S Pen stylus and is powered by Snapdragon 800 running Android 4.4 KitKat with the extensive TouchWiz customizations. The 13MP camera can record 2160p video and can high-quality zoom during recording, almost as good as the one the Nokia 1020 manages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy's perennial rival is the LG G Pro 2. It has a larger screen - 5.9" IPS LCD with 1080p resolution but LG's trademark slim bezels keep the phablet fairly compact. It too is using a Snapdragon 800 chipset to run Android 4.4 KitKat modified with Optimus UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The G Pro 2 adds optical stabilization to the 13MP / 2160p camera to one-up its nemesis, but other than that the two are closely matched.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Over ?500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All new Android flagships are already out, offering a range of cool new features. The iPhone and Windows Phone updates are a few months away, while the Androids came out recently, at almost the same time so they cost the same too. This makes the competition even more fierce.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC was the first to put its flagship on sale this year and it carries forward the highlights of the much-loved flagship from last year. The HTC One (M8) has a premium aluminum unibody and a beautiful 5" 1080p screen, flanked by front-facing stereo speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Where the One (M8) disappoints is the camera - the dual-camera is certainly unique, but its depth of field effects can be replicated by several apps on just about any Android. The 4MP still resolution is clearly insufficient, keep in mind that a single frame of 2160p video is an 8MP image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, since this is last year's sensor, image quality hasn't progressed as much as the competitors while the optical stabilization has been lost. The new HTC flagship is a fairly large device too and it might not offer enough of an upgrade for owners of last year's HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has a version called One (E8), which swaps the dual-camera for a traditional 13MP shooter. That version, however, has a plastic body and isn't available in stores just yet (soon though!).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung took steps to improve the camera from last year and the Galaxy S5 uses a fairly big 1/2.6" 16MP ISOCELL sensor that also records 2160p video. The screen grew only slightly but under-the-hood improvements reduced power usage and improves color accuracy to the best on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S5 also uses the faster Snapdragon 801 version, which runs the quad-core Krait 400 processor at 2.5GHz instead of 2.3GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new flagship steps on Xperia's with an IP67 certification (dust tight, water resistant up to 1m) and on iPhone's toes with a fingerprint scanner (PayPal-certified, usable by third-party apps to secure purchases). It's also the only phone with a built-in heart rate monitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z2 has a lot of common ground with the Galaxy S5 but tops it in several key areas. Its screen is a hair bigger, a 5.2" IPS Triluminos display with 1080p resolution, and the camera features a 1/2.3" 20.7MP sensor. That's better on paper but our head-to-head comparison revealed image quality doesn't quite live up to that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z2 can also dive deeper - the IP58 certification lets it go below 1m of water - and features front-facing stereo speakers like the HTC One (M8). And like it, its bezels are a bit too large.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it uses the 2.3GHz version of Snapdragon 801 but it packs 3GB RAM, while the Samsung has 2GB. Sony's software modifications are also lighter and better liked than TouchWiz, which has some very vocal opponents (same goes for the metal/glass design over faux leather).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 is practically the same size as the HTC One (M8) and the Xperia Z2, but fits a massive 5.5" screen (if there's one thing LG does well, it's stunning bezels). The company also upped the stakes by going to QHD resolution, that's 1,440 x 2,560.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP / 2160p camera doesn't have a large sensor like the Samsung or Sony (it's a regular 1/3" sensor) but it's optically stabilized, making it the only one of the current roster of flagship phones. The metal-like plastic on the back is attractive and resistive to scratches. It lacks stereo speakers, but has one beefy 1W (1.5W in boost mode) speaker on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G3 is powered by the same version of Snapdragon 801 chipset with 2.5GHz CPU as the Galaxy S5 but with 3GB RAM. It runs Android 4.4 KitKat with a new generation of LG Optimus UI - while clearly not stock, it flat and much more attractive than LG's previous attempts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the phone some people will buy whether we recommend it or not. Don't get us wrong, the Apple iPhone 5s is an exquisite device but it has an official price of ?800 for the 32GB version. We did manage to find a cheaper offer from a different store, but is still the most expensive device here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 4" not-even-720p screen just isn't enough anymore. Yes, the design is beautiful and iOS is still king in terms of fluidity (but not features), but at that price range you buy the iPhone 5s because you want to not because of bang for the buck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Be aware that the iPhone 6 is just months away and now would be a bad time to buy an iPhone 5s. If nothing else, it's price is bound to drop ?100 the moment its successor goes official.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are in the market for handset now and you only have &#x20ac;40 to spend, it is good enough to open the gates to instant messaging, social networks on the go, free voice-guided navigation and even document viewing - all things that are becoming more and more important in our daily lives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, &#x20ac;40 doesn't buy you a good screen, camera or chipset (not without scoring a rarely good promotion), but us old timers still can't quite believe you get an actual smartphone for so little cash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 520 continues to be king in this segment - a strong push by Microsoft to build market share keeps the US price at $60 or so, but even in Europe is under &#x20ac;100. The Lumia 630 is now out and is a fine phone, but unless you really need dual-SIM we'd still go for the 520 and give the newcomer time to drop in price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of Android, the Motorola Moto E gets you on the road to good screen, camera and chipset. The Sony Xperia M costs the same and gives it a run for its money so don't get trapped into thinking Motorola is the only maker out there with good, affordable handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For some extra cash (but still not past the &#x20ac;200 line) you actually get there - there are a number of phones from Motorola, LG, Sony and ZTE that get you 720p screens and 1080p video capture with fast enough chipsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Motorola Moto G 4G addresses some key issues of the regular Moto G and is a great deal, but so are yesteryear's midrangers like the Sony Xperia SP or LG Optimus L9 II. The BlackBerry Z10 fire sale on the other hand lets you get some capable hardware at a very low price, but we aren't recommending this one as we believe it's held down by a dying ecosystem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few high profile minies in the &#x20ac;200-&#x20ac;300 segment but the LG G2 mini and Sony Xperia Z1 Compact are the only ones that actually seem to be worth it. Samsung and HTC's minies are good too, but not worth their current asking price. It really pains us not to recommend the gorgeous smartphone that the HTC One mini 2 is, but it costs as much as a Galaxy Note 3 and the hardware inside is nowhere near as good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the same segment we also have the 2013 flagships from all major makers sans Apple. Those are great value for money and stand up well to their replacements save for some changes that might prove insignificant, like 2160p video capture (few people have UHD TVs) and additional sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick tip: the HTC One (E8) is a plastic version of the One (M8) with better camera and will be out soon. It will be significantly cheaper than its metal-clad sibling. We omitted the popular Moto X from this segment as its international price is way too high.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also snatch up a great phablet too if you sit on the opposite side of the mini movement and just want a screen as large as possible (and you should probably read our tablet shopping guide too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the line phablets, however, are typically about &#x20ac;100 more. It will be several months before those are replaced by better models and drop in price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we get to fresh flagship territory. It's outside the scope of this article to tell you which of the flagships is best but we have an ongoing series of head-to-head articles to help you decide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 5s remains the leader in terms of price, the official price of the 32GB model is &#x20ac;800, &#x20ac;200-300 more than the other flagships! Sure, it can be found for less in non-Apple stores, but with the new iPhone so close we'd advise against getting one now. If you wait you can at least save &#x20ac;100 or spend your money on Apple's newest envy machine.</paragraph>
