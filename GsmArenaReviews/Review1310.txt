			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It comes in a small package but has power to spare. Lovely little phone, assuming you can keep up with it. The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini is a full-fledged smartphone and you?ll need to be at ease with its multiple identities. But it?s not moping around wondering ?Who will I be today?? With a friendly face like this, all the horsepower seems so much easier to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many contemporary phones choose not to get obsessed with size. The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini is ? but it works the other way around. Let?s just say it doesn?t want to get into the Freudian end of things. Big phones don?t seem to have the ambiguous symbolism of big cars. Maybe they never will. But the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini likes to be on the safe side obviously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever. The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini doesn?t need a shrink. Not beyond this point anyway. And we?d better stop analyzing and get busy reviewing it. Let's take a look at the specs first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basically, the Xperia mini is a miniature version of the Neo or the Arc, and all the high-end ingredients that make up the new Xperia lineup are there. The mini has the same, albeit smaller, Reality display, the same processing power and even the same Android version as its elders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s something about the Xperia mini though that makes it even more inviting. Small is simple and beautiful. But small is affordable too. The mini Xperia costs around 200 euro at launch. And mind you, it?s not just a cheaper, smaller clone of the Xperia Arc. It?s a cool little gadget with loads of attitude.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Follow us on the next page to see what the Xperia mini is really made of.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Out of the big box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini resides in a bigger box than you?d think. There?s some extra stuff in the package, which won?t be a surprise if you?ve seen the original Xperia X10 mini. To get the standard accessories out of the way, there?re a microUSB cable, a charger and a single-piece handset inside. The usual papers go without saying, and the 2GB microSD card is already installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the older generation, the new mini comes features exchangeable battery covers. Two of them are in the bundle: in our case, Glossy Red and Glossy Blue. We cannot confirm that all retail units will ship with spare battery covers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Xperia mini 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A tad taller than the original X10 mini, the Xperia mini stands at 88 x 52 x 16 mm. Basically, it's the same chubby little handset. Minor touches to the exterior surprisingly make a lot of difference, all in the sequel's favor. The upgrades have added a bit of heft here too: the Xperia mini tips the scales at 99g. We wouldn't call it heavier, rather more solid. We don?t mind at all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To begin with the visual upgrades, the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini has a bigger screen and a different layout of controls to the original. Refinement and elegance is what describes it best, although the 3" Bravia screen probably makes all the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had the white version of the Xperia mini to test. Entirely made of plastic, the phone looks fresh and trendy. There's nothing to worry about in terms of durability either. The battery cover has fingerprint-proof matt finish, as opposed to the glossy back of the Xperia mini pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two silver lines on the sides are the only ornaments to note, the white case needs little decoration anyway. It's a small phone with plenty of character. Sony Ericsson did well to refresh the looks without overdoing it. Emphasis is obviously on the performance upgrades.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini has the same 3? HVGA touchscreen as the mini pro. It's a reduced version of the Reality display used in the Arc and the Neo, a LED-backlit LCD unit enhanced by Sony?s proprietary Bravia Mobile Engine. The display produces really nice colors. Contrast is good but the viewing angles are limited ? colors get quickly washed out. The excellent outdoor performance is a major point in favor though. We were impressed with the level of sunlight legibility. Good job, Sony Ericsson!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is pleasingly responsive too - no wonder in a capacitive unit. The gentlest of taps and swipes will do, and the speedy, lag-free interface will instantly respond.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display is the usual set-up of controls. The updated design has capacitive Menu and Back buttons, with a single hardware Home key. The Home button is soft but clicky, while the capacitive controls are well-defined, nicely backlit and haptic enabled. All are very comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, the centrally-placed earpiece is followed by proximity and ambient light sensors. There is no front-facing camera, unlike the Xperia mini pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's both manual and auto display brightness setting and the ambient light sensor is doing a good job of adjusting to the available lighting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini is completely bare. The only thing to notice here is a small slit to use and pull the battery cover open.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side, we have the volume rocker on top and a shutter key at the bottom. The volume rocker is reasonably comfortable, the up and down keys are prominent and solid to press. The shutter key is super soft, with very deep half press. We liked it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top, we find the power/lock key, with a tiny status LED right next to it. It will glow red while the battery is charging (green when fully charged), or blink in blue upon an incoming call. The secondary microphone used for noise cancelation is also around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Xperia mini features the lanyard eyelet and the mouthpiece. The connectivity ports are also there: a centrally-placed 3.5mm audio jack and a microUSB port with a small plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Xperia mini features the 5 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash. The loudspeaker also goes in here, slightly to the right. We like the matt finish, being more resistant to dirt perhaps. Makes sense in a white phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the hot-swappable microSD card slot and the SIM compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1200mAh battery is quoted at 320 hours of standby and 4 and a half hours of talk time in a 3G network. In reality, we had the Xperia mini on stand-by for about three days, connected to a Wi-Fi network most of the time. When we really pushed it hard though, it barely managed a whole day. It was always connected to both the 3G and Wi-Fi networks, we did heavy browsing, music and video playback, and the usual benchmarks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini is a well-built phone with fresh, modern looks and it is a pleasure to handle. It's an easy phone to like, neat and simple, though not feeling cheap. On the contrary, the good build and quality finish will be much appreciated. The screen is a massive improvement over the original. Size is what you should be careful about: it's absolutely fine for navigating the interface. It?s just the on-screen keyboard that's not the most comfortable. Overall though, you should be able to live with it. After all, it's size that makes the phone unique, bordering on premium.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Light-speed Gingerbread<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread and Sony Ericsson have that covered with the Timescape UI. The mini inherits the corner-based homescreen from the previous generation of minis, but Sony Ericsson have done some extra work on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the user experience isn?t too much different from that on the other Xperia phones released this year, we?ll reuse some portions of the text of our previous reviews. You can rest assured that we?ve reflected all the Xperia mini specifics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The corner UI aside, the rest of the interface is pretty much similar to what we saw in the Arc, the Neo and the Play - though resized to fit the HVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We guess there should hardly be a person left unfamiliar with the Android 2.3 Gingerbread and the latest Sony Ericsson skin, but we're still going to cover the basics just in case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We quite like Sony Ericsson's Overview mode on the homescreen. You pinch to zoom out on any of the 5 homescreen panes and a new pane sets in with a cool transition effect to display all of your active widgets. If there is not enough space for all the widgets, they start floating on the screen overlapping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Overview mode is similar to HTC?s Leap view or what Samsung have on the Galaxy S. However, widgets are not ordered in mini screens, so small that you cannot actually see what?s on each of them. Widgets are shuffled together instead so they can better use the space. They are as big as possible and thus easier to tap on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's see about the four corner tabs on the homescreen. They can host up to four shortcuts each, as easy to assign as a simple drag-and-drop. If a corner has a single shortcut (just the dialer for example), the respective app launches automatically upon a tap. If there is more than one shortcut - the tab expands so you can make your choice properly. You can't put folders there though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating folders on the homescreen is nice and simple, the way it?s done on the iPhone. You drag an icon over another and a pop-up appears, prompting you to select a name and layout for the new folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini supports both static and live wallpapers. There are 15 static wallpapers and a single live one (Maps), but you can always get more at the Market or use a picture from your personal gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia mini has themes enabled too but the implementation is pretty basic: a theme only changes the wallpaper and the system menus. On a positive note, if you like Sony Ericsson's wave theme but you are tired of watching it in blue, now you can have it in a lot more colors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the main menu, you will see shortcuts in the bottom corners. They let you sort your icons within the grid ? you can either go for the automatic options (alphabetical, most used or recently installed) or you can manually move the icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Sony Ericsson app called LiveWare is preinstalled on the Xperia mini pro. It lets you set the behavior of your handset when paired with an accessory. You can have an app launch automatically when headset, headphones or a charger is connected. You can, for example make the mini start the music player each time you plug-in your headphones or go to picture frame mode each time you connect a charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection is a major change in the user interface since Gingerbread - it's done by placing two large pointers either side of the marked text. You can then drag each of those easily to make the selection you need. It really doesn?t get much simpler than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as general performance is concerned, the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini does splendidly - no lags, no freezes, no problems whatsoever. It uses a Qualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon chipset featuring a 1 GHz Scorpion CPU and the Adreno 205 GPU - the same as the Xperia Neo, Arc, Pro and PLAY. But it's even faster because of the lower screen resolution (HVGA). You can see for yourself in the benchmarks below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it?s not synthetic benchmarks that we should focus on ? the real life performance matters here and the Xperia mini is smooth as silk. Not that we expected less - Sony Ericsson is getting everything right in this respect lately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A better Timescape UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Timescape brings all your communications together: an aggregate view of your SMS, MMS, email, call log, Facebook and Twitter updates. Timescape has a tabbed structure, allowing you to filter the contents by type and get all relevant information in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Timescape you not only see the latest activities and updates of your contacts but also share your own status, reply to received messages or return a missed call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part of the new Timescape is that you can set it as a homescreen widget. It will show all of your updates as tiles. You no longer need to sacrifice all your homescreen real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If all these functions are not enough, there are free Timescape plugins on the Android Market for Sony Ericsson users. Currently, you can update your Timescape with mixi, Foursquare, Orkut, Gmail, Music and Photo extensions.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia mini's visually customized phonebook can store extensive information about all your contacts. The list can be sorted by either first or last name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts, or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If someone is added in more than one account, you can ?join? their contact info. This can be really handy as you can have Facebook, Twitter or other service details all in the same place with the regular contact?s details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts are enabled ? a tap on the contact?s photo brings up shortcuts for calling, texting or emailing the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each contact can have a variety of fields (and repeat fields of the same type), the plus and X buttons let you add and remove fields as needed. The fields cover anything from names (including a field to write down the name phonetically) to addresses, nicknames and notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an option to redirect calls directly to voicemail. Personalized ringtones are enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can "star" a contact, which puts it in the Favorites tab. Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two contact search options ? a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll (available only when you start scrolling) to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony still lacks smart dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just as all the latest Xperia phones, the mini held on to signal well and we didn?t experience dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reception levels are good on both ends of calls, the earpiece is loud enough and there were no interferences whatsoever. The built-in secondary microphone is used for active noise-cancellation so calls are loud and clear even in noisy environments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Xperia mini does not support smart dialing. There?s voice dialing though (the quickest way to activate it is the dedicated homescreen widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor, the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini automatically switches off its touchscreen when you hold it next to your ear during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini. Sony Ericsson has implemented the xLOUD technology within both mini and mini pro. It enhances the loudspeaker volume without distortion of the sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality the xLOUD works great for the Xperia mini making it ring much louder, while on mini pro it decreases the loudness. We have no idea why. Anyway, the mini scored a Below Average result with xLOUD turned off and an Average mark with xLOUD turned on. So we suggest keeping this setting on. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department of Android values simplicity in design and is very easy to use. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is laid out as an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (against deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quick Contacts feature only works in separate messages, not in the whole thread. You can also activate delivery reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a text is a little frustrating as the text box starts off as a single line and grows only to three lines, which makes working with longer texts harder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there?s no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has added a Preview Pane to the generic email client. The preview pane can be expanded and collapsed, as well as thumb scrolled. The nice thing here is the pane stays exactly where you left it and can save you a few taps. We didn't expect the Pane to work on the 3-inch display, but it turned out as useful as on a bigger and high-res one. You can check out our video demo to see how it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input - three virtual keyboards<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia mini offers just the default (Gingerbread) on-screen full QWERTY keyboard (portrait and landscape) and a virtual numeric pad in portrait mode only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a ?handle? attached to the text cursor ? it?s easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A tap and hold will bring up the select options ? select word and select all ? with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection. Another tap and hold brings up the copy/cut options.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The usual gallery, still downsizing the photos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia mini uses the traditional droid Gallery, which hasn?t really seen much change in Gingerbread. It has good functionality, cool 3D looks and nice transition effects, but unfortunately only shows a downsized version of your images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The different albums and folders appear as piles of photos, which fall in neat grids once selected. If you have online albums over at Picasa those show up as separate stacks as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, your photos can be sorted by date with the help of a button in the top right corner, which switches between grid and timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In grid view, there?s a date slider, which can also be used to find photos taken on a certain date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports finger scrolling or panning so you can skip images without having to return to the default view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just swipe to the left or right when viewing a photo in fullscreen mode and the previous/next image will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Xperia mini's multi-touch support pinch zooming is also available here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android gallery still shows only downsized version of you images, though if you send one from here the full-res shot is received on the other end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS also comes in handy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Limited codec support for the video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player app on the Xperia mini as in most of the droids out there. Fair enough, maybe a fancy UI for picking a video is not that important, playing videos is what really counts. Well, that?s another disappointment ? the video player supports only 3GP and MP4 videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To its credit, the Xperia mini did play a 720p MP4 video though (it records 720p videos, so it's expected to). And the 3 ? HVGA Reality screen is a pure joy to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are welcomed to download a capable video player off the Android Market and make your life easier though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the Xperia mini is quite a looker. The interface is laid out in four tabs for the available sorting options: all artists, all tracks, playlists and albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you hit the menu key you?ll get send and delete options. There is also a dedicated search bar at the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers nothing but the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, the current album and the Infinite key, which allows you to quickly look up a song or album on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only available visualization is the album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music fans will appreciate the equalizer: it?s a rich selection of presets. There is also an xLOUD setting to enhance the device speaker volume.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a really neat and simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and places ?notches? on the frequency dial for easier scrolling to the next station. Or you can mark some of them as favorite for easier scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TrackID service for song recognition is also available and works within the radio app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality good as expected<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having reviewed its QWERTY-packing brother, we knew pretty well what to expect from the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini. It would make little sense for Sony Ericsson to produce the two devices with different hardware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The output is especially convincing when you use the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini with an active external amplifier. As you can see from the table below the mini got great scores across the board in that scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, there's some degradation when headphones are connected, most notably in terms of stereo crosstalk and intermodulation distortion. Still, the mini remains quite a lot better than average and, in general, performs better than you could probably expect given its price tag and focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Uninspiring 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia mini boasts a 5 megapixel snapper with a single LED flash. There is a handy dedicated shutter key too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of the Xperia mini?s camera is quite intuitive. You have a bar with five shortcuts to popular features on the right, a bar with the latest captured images on the left and still camera/camcorder switch at the bottom. You can hide or expand both bars with swiping gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The five most used shortcuts allow you to change the capturing mode, resolution, to pick a scene, turn on flash and switch to the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon pressing the menu key (or dragging the left bar to the right side) you get some extra customizable options like focus mode, touch capture, white balance, geo tagging and image stabilization. The Xperia mini also boasts face detection and smile shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is identical to what we saw on the mini pro - good, but it could have been much better. There?s enough of fine detail in the Xperia mini shots and the color rendering is good, but the noise levels are too high.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. The Tool?s page has a quick how to guide and also what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can clearly see from the comparison tool that the shots are pretty much identical with mini pro and the mini's samples and fall behind other 5 megapixel snappers.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Questionable HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HD video recording is turning as a hot feature recently and the Xperia Neo is doing relatively well with the framerate. It?s 30fps and quite steady too. As some previous Xperia devices, the mini also captures few duplicated frames, but not that much to ruin the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia mini camcorder supports continuous autofocus. Its approach is the same as on the Xperia X10, Arc, Neo, etc: it may take a few seconds to refocus after you reframe instead of fast and constant re-focusing. It?s certainly the approach we prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite expectedly, the video quality is on par with the mini pro. The videos run smooth, but the captured detail is low and there's a pinkish spot in the center. On the positive side, the color rendering is spot on. The HD samples look good on the small display, but they are not that great on a bigger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 720p sample that we captured with the Xperia mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is another one that we uploaded on YouTube for your convenience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We added the Xperia mini samples to our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with the other 720p mobile camcorders we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of fine detail is evident when compared to competing products plus there's a pinkish spot in the center of the frame, although it's not that intrusive as it was on the mini pro.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini has the full set of connectivity options: quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and tri-band HSPA with download rates of up to 7.2 Mbps and upload at 5.76 Mbps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers Wi-Fi (b/g/n) with DLNA support, USB v2.0 and Bluetooth 2.1. If you want to use the phone for DLNA, you should use the dedicated Connected Devices application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inbuilt storage is 400MB only, though additional storage can be added with a microSD card. The phone ships with a 2GB memory card, which has only 750MB of free space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard 3.5mm audio jack completes the connectivity tally.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A droid browser with good Flash support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Android 2.3 Gingerbread and the Adobe Flash 10.3 support, the Xperia mini?s web browser does a great job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is pretty light at first sight. Once the page loads, all you see is the URL bar and the bookmark button on a line at the top of the screen. Once you zoom in or pan around though even that line disappears (scroll to the top or press menu to bring it back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3-inch HVGA screen may sounds not enough, but we can assure you it is and you have all that 3 inches for web browsing. The Xperia mini's browser supports double tap and pinch zooming, along with the dedicated virtual zoom buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports text reflow, but it works only with double tap ? a moment after setting the zoom level just double tap on the display and the columns of text will align to fit the screen width. Without text reflow you will either have to zoom out until the text fits (but then it?s too small to read comfortably) or scroll sideways to read each line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The minimalist UI is quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up. You can open a new tab, switch tabs, refresh the page, go forward, and open bookmarks. The final button reveals even more options (text copying, find on page, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bookmark list shows a thumbnail of the bookmarked page and you also get a ?most visited? list in addition to the history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The web browser has full Flash support with the Adobe Flash 10.3 player (downloadable for free from the Market). YouTube videos played quite smoothly (360p), and so did the games from Kongregate, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high-quality videos on YouTube and other Flash video services had some (or lots of) dropped frames, but the overall Flash performance turned out pretty decent. The YouTube app is still there though, just in case.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini comes with a solid set of organizing options, including a document viewer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app in question is OfficeSuite and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app ($10).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Reading documents is quite comfortable despite the compact screen and panning is blazing fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching all kinds of files is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda view. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized - the buttons are really big and easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock app allows a huge number of alarms to be set, each with its own start and repeat time. Unfortunately, you don?t have the Stopwatch, Timer or World Clock options. You don?t get a Voice Recorder either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But all of the applications missing on the Xperia mini can be downloaded for free off the Android Market in a matter of minutes, so it?s not a big deal really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are lots of icons in the in the main menu to mimic apps, but most of them are actually shortcuts to the web browser. The ones that do something are the Update Center - to check for updates from Sony Ericsson, NeoReader - a barcode scanner and Touchnote to create virtual postcards. That's pretty much all.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS with Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini comes with a GPS receiver, which locked onto satellites in about 3 minutes with A-GPS turned off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the main application and its Street View mode is probably the best part of the deal in places where turn-by-turn voice navigation isn?t yet offered. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the area. Zoom is supported through pinch and double tap gestures. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the surroundings!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turn-by-turn voice guidance using Google Maps Navigation is only available in select countries and unless you live in one of them the best you can do is plan a route in advance and keep an eye on your current location during travel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the Xperia mini with Maps 5 out of the box, which gives you access to some great features. Offline rerouting is one ? if you stray off course, Maps will recalculate the route without the need for an Internet connection. You can?t change the destination without connection though. There are also 3D buildings (where available), two finger rotation, tilting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depending on your region you may get the Xperia mini with Wisepilot navigation pre-installed, but you'll have to pay for it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market and PlayNow Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and three buttons (Applications, Games and My apps). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson's own store called PlayNow is also on board. There you can get a lot of free things for your phone - wallpapers, some games and apps or even music tracks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have done it again - and not because they were running out of room.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What was it again? About good things and small packages? Sorry, Xperia Arc. Nothing personal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia mini is back with a bang, and in its best shape. The compact body was the unique selling point of the original mini. Sony Ericsson have apparently been busy ticking the rest of the boxes. The sequel is nearly the same size but has more to show for it. The Xperia mini is a textbook example of an upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It inherits everything important from the superior members of the Xperia lineup. With a Reality display, Snapdragon core and the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread, the Xperia mini offers the complete Android experience. A feature-rich phone that looks good and doesn't charge a fortune: the price at launch is less than ?200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not an exaggeration to say the Xperia mini is the best smartphone for its size. It may as well be one of the best performers for its price too. It looks ready to build on the success of its predecessor but its appeal will certainly extend beyond the brand's loyal base. The Sony Ericsson Xperia mini will not shrink in the face of competition. It will stand tall and say "Bring it on".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Wildfire S costs about the same but cannot quite match the 1GHz, Gingerbread-powered and HD video enabled Xperia mini. What the Wildfire S has in its favor is HTC Sense, feature-rich and full of eye-candy. Custom skins for Android don't get any better than that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Wildfire S</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia C6-01 is a Symbian alternative with a beautiful 3.2" ClearBlack display and as of recently running Symbian Anna. The AMOLED screen has higher resolution and the metal body wins extra points too. Add HD video recording, USB On-the-go, DivX and XviD and TV Out to the free of charge SatNav solution and you have a pretty good mix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia C6-01</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Froyo-running LG Optimus Me and the Samsung Galaxy Mini (updated to Gingerbread) are a lot cheaper but come with poor low-res screens, less capable hardware and low-end features. They wouldn't make much sense as alternatives of even the original Xperia X10 mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Optimus Me P350 ? Samsung Galaxy Mini S5570</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to the original Xperia X10 mini, we guess it can safely call it a day. The ultra-compact class is in safe hands and stays in the family. Things are looking good for Sony Ericsson in the midrange - and the Xperia mini is a small phone that can make a big difference. It doesn't want to be a flagship when it grows up. Good. It can be anything it wants.</paragraph>
