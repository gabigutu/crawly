			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 has a license to chill. Unburdened with high expectations, this phone is getting ready to surprise you. Not in it for the win, it has too much class to lose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scorching hot body and super crisp ClearBlack AMOLED screen, the Nokia 700 is stepping on its 1GHz processor to the delight of those who like their Symbian shaken (Belle) not stirred.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Small phone ready for big things. That's how we summed the Nokia 700 up in our preview. Time we guess for it to take its first big test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the typical thin smartphone keeps fit by spreading the innards out under a huge slab of a 4+ inch screen, the Nokia 700 is compact in every dimension. That includes weight too - the nice metal touches that give the 700 its solid hand feel haven't pushed the weight over 100g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.2" nHD screen is a perfect fit in this petite smartphone. The AMOLED unit uses Nokia's ClearBlack technology, which has repeatedly demonstrated its great image quality and near-perfect sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 has a lot going for it, but it?s not without downsides either. Here go our traditional lists:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's under the hood should come as no surprise. Nokia's current crop of Symbian phones have more or less the same hardware. The camera is down a notch to 5MP from the 8MP unit in the 701. However, with both using fixed-focus optics and both shooting 720p video, we don?t think there's that much of a difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside is Symbian Belle, which we quite liked, running on the 1GHz CPU and 512MB combo that's enough to keep Android happy, let alone an OS that emerged around 2001.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flip over to the next page to find out what the Finns packaged the Nokia 700 with and find out if it enjoys the typical Nokia build quality (spoiler: it does).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 700 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In automotive terms, the Nokia 700 would be a supermini. It's less than a centimeter thin and below the 100g threshold, but still packs a punch. The exact dimensions are 110 x 50.7 x 9.7 mm and 96g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Nokia 700 brings no surprises<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 700 comes in a standard Nokia box. You get a presumably very power-efficient charger that ends on a 2mm plug. The phone does charge off USB too so you can still use a microUSB charger to juice up your Nokia 700 and other assorted gadgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, there's a long microUSB cable and a typical one-piece headset. There's no microSD card included in the retail package, you'll have to rely on the 2GB of built-in memory for storage out of the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 is touted as the company?s most environmentally-friendly handset to date. Internals are made of recycled materials and bio-based paints are used for the finish. Nokia claim 60% use of sustainable eco-friendly materials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make it even better, Nokia managed to mix them all together into one very solid shell - the thin body is a well-balanced mix of plastic and metal. It's neither too heavy nor too plasticky. You see mostly metal on the back and mostly tough Gorilla Glass on the front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our test unit is the Cool Grey color option but a selection of paintjobs will be available: Silver/White (which we used for the preview), Coral Red, Peacock Blue and Purple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 has a 3.2" nHD (360x640) ClearBlack AMOLED display. AMOLEDs offer unrivaled viewing angles and deep blacks and, at 229ppi, the screen is pretty sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ClearBlack technology does a good job of reducing reflections, which improves outdoor visibility. Early AMOLEDs had trouble with sunlight, but that's not the case with the Nokia 700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display posted impressive 504 nits of brightness - not the brightest AMOLED (that honor still belongs to the X7), but it beats Samsung's SuperAMOLED Plus and it beats a lot of LCDs (which are typically brighter than AMOLED since they use a backlight), including the screen of the iPhone 4 (but not the 4S).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the comparison table that shows the values we measured for the Nokia 700 and several other phones. Keep in mind that all AMOLEDs have theoretically infinite contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display, you'll find a proximity sensor to disable the screen during calls and an ambient light sensor. There's a slim earpiece at the very top, but no video call camera in sight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display there are three hardware buttons: the Call keys and a centrally-placed Menu button. The keys don't protrude much, but they're still easy enough to press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very bottom of the front there's the loudspeaker grill, a strong design accent at that. Projecting slightly from under the rest of the front, the loudspeaker forms a subtle chin. This is the perfect position for the loudspeaker to blast sound around the room. The thin metallic grill is a prominent color accent and it is also where the primary microphone is placed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Nokia 700 features a total of 4 buttons - all of which are very thin, barely protruding and not the easiest to press. The volume rocker is at the top, followed by a lock button and the shutter key. The lock key can be particularly hard to find and press just by feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like other recent Symbians, if you press and hold the lock key, the LED flash will turn on even if the phone is locked. Do the same to switch it back off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Nokia 700 offers no controls whatsoever but emphasizes the design of the handset - the three sheets of plastic and metal form an asymmetrical pattern that looks good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top, there are three wired plugs. The 2mm charger plug and the microUSB port can both be used for charging and there's also a 3.5mm headphone jack so you could connect any set of earphones to the Nokia 700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the phone features the lanyard eyelet only. It's where the "chin" formed by the loudspeaker is most obvious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Nokia 700 is a mix of plastic with a metal back panel ? a replica of the X3-02 Touch and Type. The panel has brushed-metal finish and it's surrounded by matte plastic. Both are pretty good at hiding fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top you'll find the 5 MP fixed-focus camera lens with a small LED flash. There's a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a latch to open the back panel. Doing so reveals the SIM slot, the 1080mAh Li-Ion battery and the microSD card slot. Unfortunately, both slots are blocked by the battery, which has to be removed if you want to access either of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery of the Nokia 700 is quoted at 465h/450h standby and 7:10h/4:30h talk time (2G and 3G). Music playback is said to go as long as 47h.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Years of expertise in phone design are one of Nokia's key assets and the Nokia 700 is a shining example of that. The premium feel in the hand and the look of that ClearBlack screen easily rival some high-end phones that cots a lot more than the Nokia 700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If only the software leaves such a positive impression, the Nokia 700 can be a winner. That's precisely what we'll attempt to find out, starting on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian Belle makes a difference<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia have Windows Phone in the driving seat and Symbian will have to settle for a backup role. But an OS that was once too big to fail, is finally moving too good to throw away. A good looking phone like the Nokia 700 is the perfect vessel for the new Symbian Belle. The new fast, fluid and beautiful Symbian Belle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's Belle on video because static screenshots don't tell the whole story:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key elements in the Belle makeover are the new homescreen and menu, the updated native apps and overall polish of the interface. Here?s an extensive video demo starring Nokia 700, so you can get a good feel of Belle before we start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get up to six homescreens (up from three) and you can delete unneeded ones. Each homescreen has its own individual wallpaper, rather than one for all to share. A notable contrast with Android, the scrolling of homescreen panes is looped so you never need to go back from the last one. Auto-rotation of the homescreen is enabled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets have dropped the one-size-fits-all philosophy and now come in up to five sizes. In addition to widgets, you can also put shortcuts on the homescreen ? the end of the silly shortcut widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a widget or shortcut activates edit mode, but only for that widget/shortcut. You can?t touch the others ? there?s no mode where you can edit everything at once (which seems a bit inconvenient). You can move, delete or (where available) access the settings of the selected one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides widgets and app shortcuts, you can also add contact shortcuts to the homescreen. To do that you need to go into the Options menu of the contact?s details, but the extra taps are worth it. You end up with one-touch access to the contacts you call most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the homescreen has three virtual buttons ? menu, dialer and homescreen settings. The other big addition to the homescreen is the pull-down status bar at the top of the screen ? think Android?s notification area or the Notification Center in iOS 5. This area is where notifications and status info wait for your attention, but you also get toggles for mobile data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This pull-down status bar is available on any screen so you can also quickly change a setting and look up new events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, the main menu has changed as well ? it?s now completely flat, no level upon level of subfolders nonsense any more. Or at least not by default ? you could still manually create folders, if you like. You can?t put folders in folders though (not that you?d want to do that anyway).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You sort icons alphabetically or manually, by choosing the Arrange option and Nokia menu items around. You can?t drop a shortcut in a folder while arranging them though. To do that, you have to press and hold on a shortcut, choose Move to folder and then select the desired folder. There are also Add to homescreen and delete options here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This arrangement isn?t as convenient as in other OSes and it contrasts with how the homescreen works. On the homescreen you press and hold to move an item, while a tap and hold on a menu item pulls out a menu. To move items around you have to hit the Options key and choose Arrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a bit odd the way folders on the homescreen work ? you can only add a folder to the homescreen by first creating it in the menu. After you've added it to the homescreen, it remains visible in the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because the main menu is busier than usual - and will only get more crowded as you install extra apps - the search option is a handy addition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager in Symbian Belle is virtually unchanged ? press and hold the Menu key and it pops up. It fits a bunch of side-scrollable thumbnails, one for each of the currently open apps. It?s worth noting that hitting the End key will terminate an app, while pressing the Menu key just goes to the homescreen with the app active in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian Belle on Nokia 700 is fast, responsive, beautiful. It?s an experience that everybody will like. This is how Symbian should've looked and behaved all along.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Efficient phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 comes with a very capable phonebook, which can easily be synced with your Exchange account. Symbian has been offering users virtually unlimited phonebook capacity and excellent contact management for quite some time and now the Belle update continues the tradition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be ordered by first or last name. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting some of your contacts as favorites moves them to the top of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can assign personal ringtones and videos to individual contacts. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really nice touch when editing a contact is the option to enter their address by locating it on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The social network integration includes Facebook and Twitter, which should be fine for the vast majority of users. You can see the latest status update right from the contact info - or at least the first three lines of it. A tap on it brings you to a new screen where you can read the whole message and you get options to view the sender's profile and more updates . That takes a few seconds though as the Social app needs to load first.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Reception on the Nokia 700 is good and we didn?t experience dropped calls. There?s an extra microphone for active noise-cancellation. Voice dialing is available on the Nokia 700 and gets activated by pressing and holding the call key. It is fully speaker-independent and as far as we can tell performs greatly, recognizing all the names we threw at it. In noisier environments though, its effectiveness might suffer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is also enabled - you just punch in a few letters from the desired contact?s name and select it from the list that comes up to initiate a call. There's speed dial too on the virtual dial pad. The final option for starting a call is via the shortcuts you can place on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 has the neat accelerometer-based feature that lets you mute the ringer by turning the phone face down. That same turn-to-mute trick also works for snoozing your alarm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the screen is automatically disabled during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 took our traditional loudspeaker test scored a Below Average mark - worse than the C7 - and it might result in some missed calls. More info on the test, as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging complete<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All your incoming messages arrive in a shared inbox and by default are displayed in threads. You can use the old inbox too if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 relies on a shared editor for all the types of messages. Stuff like a character counter in SMS goes without saying. Insert some multimedia content and the message is automatically transformed into an MMS. In that case, the character counter turns into a data counter showing kilobytes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 automatically set up our Gmail account in no time, complete with Exchange Active Sync configuration. Usually, all you need is to enter a username and a password and you will be good to go. A few settings had to be entered manually for the Active Sync setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia 700.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can be sorted by various filters such as date, sender, subject, priority or even by attachments, search is enabled as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. For that you get two separate settings: syncing frequency and peak and off-peak sync times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments, signatures and basically everything you would normally need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>QWERTY keyboards and split screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since Anna, the Symbian portrait QWERTY keyboard has split screen support, meaning the top half of the screen is left for the app, while the bottom part is for the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys on the portrait QWERTY are a small and it doesn't get that much better in landscape on the narrow 3.2" screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, you can activate word prediction, which will guess the word you're trying to type and show a small popup with the word you actually typed, in case you're trying to enter something like a user name or an URL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This eliminates the annoying situation of taking you out of the app and into a text edit screen and then back to the app (entering URLs in the browser and using the URL autocomplete was the most painful example). Also, you no longer have to change orientation just to use the QWERTY keyboard, which was a major nuisance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it's not perfect - several apps continue to use the old text edit screen, obscuring the app even though we were using the portrait QWERTY. The Nokia store app is an example of where that happens, which was a little disappointing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike some competing platforms, Symbian handsets have always enjoyed a proper file manager. The File manager aboard the Nokia 700 is a capable app that can basically do anything you want with your files - moving, copying renaming, sorting or sending - you name it. You can also password-protect your memory card if you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for a specific file or directory. Type in a part of the desired file name and specify location (phone memory or memory card), the File Manager will find it in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZIP manager also comes in handy when you get an archive in the mail or need to send several files easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With USB OTG enabled on the Nokia 700, you can also use the file manger to access USB flash drives, card readers and even other phones connected over a USB OTG cable (sold separately).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian phones would connect easily in mass storage mode, but other OSes weren't as forthcoming. Still, if you need to grab some files off a thumb drive and you have the cable at hand, USB OTG can be quite useful.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery looks fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery app in Nokia 700 is quite the looker. It's been around since Symbian^3, so it's not exactly new but we're glad to be rid of the old one. Photos are displayed in a grid (3 columns) and you can scroll up and down (with kinetic scrolling no less).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in by double-tapping or the now standard pinch zoom. Once zoomed in, kinetic scrolling is available and animates smoothly. Switching between portrait and landscape mode is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selection of multiple photos for deleting or sharing is available right inside the gallery. You can send an image via MMS, email or over Bluetooth and you can share it on your social network (Twitter or Facebook).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features of the gallery include the image tagging system for easier image sorting, the slide show and the albums system (again helping you sort your image database).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture browsing is fast, there's only the occasional lag. The rest of the time it runs buttery smooth. Noticeably better than the 680MHz Nokias.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian never had trouble with the music player features but looks were far from impressive. With Symbian^3 however Nokia introduced a new Cover Flow-like interface, which adds the much needed eye-candy. For better or worse, Nokia hasn't changed anything since.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s automatic sorting by artist, album, genre and the option to create custom playlists straight on the phone. Selecting an artist lists all of their tracks with the album cover art on top along with the covers of other albums in your library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Left and right swipes on the album art let you skip to the next/previous song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. In this case you can control it via the music player widget on the homescreen, which also displays the currently running track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have equalizer presets but no manual settings, along with a Loudness setting and Stereo widening.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 700 is hardly the most impressive performer in terms of audio quality, but it's not too bad either. As with most modern day smartphones, the Belle-running 700 does pretty well with an active external amplifier, but doesn't handle headphones too great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line-out (i.e. when you use the Nokia 700 with your car stereo or your home audio system) the Nokia 700 does marvelously with no weak points whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we plugged in a pair of headphones, however, stereo crosstalk surged to below average levels and a significant amount of intermodulation distortion crept in. It's not a disastrous performance, but it's not great either, so it brings down the overall score quite a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is some audio codecs short of impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 comes with a capable video player. It managed all formats we threw at it (MP4, AVI, WMV, even MKV) and videos were silky smooth up to and including 720p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The media player works in fullscreen landscape mode. The exceptionally bright screen with native 16:9 aspect is also more than welcome for truly enjoying your videos - even in broad daylight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fullscreen mode, a tap on the screen shows the controls, which are otherwise hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 played large files almost trouble free. There's subtitle support too, but the file has to have the same name as the video file (you can't manually load subtitles) and we ran into problems with subtitle encoding, getting gibberish most of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet that's not the biggest problem we had with the video player - while it had no problem with 720p h.264-encoded videos, it chocked on the sound. A quick investigation revealed that the AC3 and DTS codecs aren't supported - a problem since they are the most common codecs save for stereo MP3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Video section also includes a few auxiliary apps. One is an editor that lets you create videos and video slideshows. The other apps here include YouTube, CNN Video, E!, National Geographic, and Paramount Pictures Movie Teasers. Of course, each of them requires Internet connection (over 3G/3.5G or Wi-Fi) and note that not all content is free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio comes with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia 700 comes with a neat and simple interface. You can skip preset and new stations alike with sweep gestures or you can use the virtual buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 has RDS support and automatic scanning for an alternative frequency.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The 5MP fixed-focus camera is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 has a 5MP fixed-focus camera for a maximum image resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. There is a single-LED flash too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface has changed since Anna, but the changes are mostly cosmetic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen - it's a landscape viewfinder - you get a row of shortcuts: Back, Flash mode, Scenes, Extended options and Menu. The latter doesn't make much sense - it only launches the user guide or lets you exit the camera app. In other handsets with a front-mounted camera it's where you toggle front and rear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right, there's a virtual shutter key (often preferable over the physical one, which is too small and stiff) and a toggle for the still/video modes. On the left, there's a digital zoom lever that auto-hides.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the extended options you get more goodies like face detection, a self-timer, image settings (ISO, white balance, sharpness, etc.) and a shortcut to one last group of settings where you have geotagging and capture tone options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout of the ISO setting was a massive disappointment. It's a list (Auto, Low, Med, High) and you tap once to select and once again to activate. Maybe they did it so you can read the tooltips that pop up as you select each option. On the other hand, the Sharpness setting works the same way and all you get there is a simple Hard, Normal, Soft. Anyway, it's hard to believe it's the only spot in the interface that escaped the attention of the designers and got away with the double-tap nuisance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the image quality though that's the biggest issue. Maybe a faulty unit is to blame, or it's just the best Nokia 700 can do. Most, if not all, of the pictures seem out of focus. Only the closest objects in the scene look OK. Everything else is soft and blurry, lacking almost any detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even without the problematic focusing, close-ups are the Nokia 700's weak spot. It just can't get close to a subject and take a photo. Even from some distance, text comes out pretty badly.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've added the Nokia 700 to our Photo Compare Tool, where it joins the other fixed-focus 5MP Nokias. Here you will clearly see the softer images.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera captures 720p videos @ 30fps and with stereo sound courtesy of the dedicated second microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is virtually identical to the still camera interface. Among the options are scenes, video light, video stabilization. You can enable or disable audio recording and geotagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an advanced option, which not only shows the rule of thirds grid, but also splits the viewfinder in a cinema-like 21:9 frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the video capture suffers from the same problems we witnessed in the still shots - soft, out of focus videos and little to no detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the quality for yourselves, here's a sample we uploaded to YouTube:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-round connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 has an impressive list of connectivity options. First off, the basics. You get a true worldwide-ready phone: quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and five-band 3G with HSDPA (14.4Mbps) and HSUPA (5.76Mbps). Wherever there's a GSM network you'd get voice calls and data, blazing fast data actually if the networks supports it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then for local connectivity, you get Wi-Fi b/g/n and Bluetooth 3.0 (no HS profile though). There's USB with On-The-Go support for wired connectivity. The 3.5mm audio jack doubles as a composite TV-out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The star of the show however is the NFC support - it makes pairing as simple as you could possibly imagine, just put two NFC-enabled gadgets (e.g. the 700 and a headset) together and the two will connect. Hooray, no more PIN codes!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sending stuff works the same way - select the files you want to send (one or many) and tap the two phones together. They'll handle the rest, including switching on the Bluetooth receiver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It would have been nice to have Wi-Fi Direct or Bluetooth 3.0+HS to speed up file transfers, but unless you're sending large HD videos, things go fast enough.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A better web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The browser interface has been shuffled a bit, resulting in improved usability but nothing major.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top you have the URL bar, which auto-hides ones the page loads. Once you start typing a "Search for..." pop-up lets you choose one of several search engines (Google and Bing are offered in most locations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom you have a fixed row with five shortcuts - Back, Forward, Bookmarks, Tabs and Menu. The addition of the Tabs shortcut makes managing multiple pages easier - in earlier versions you had to go through the popup menu, involving a few extra clicks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The popup menu itself is pretty much the same. You get RSS feeds, find on page, Most visited, etc.,There's a "More" entry too, which brings the final set of rarely used browser options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text reflow is supported, which makes reading sites meant for desktop that much easier on the mobile screen. Kinetic scrolling is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports FlashLight 4. It felt fluid and fast when we panned around a page and zoomed in and out. We didn?t really see any pages break in the browser either. Nokia has spruced up the Symbian browser in Belle and claim it's now three times faster.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian has a solid track record in the PIM department and the Nokia 700 with Symbian Belle is no exception. Nokia has just tweaked a thing or two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and a to-do list, which allows you to check all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are three types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has some specific fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync the phone's calendar with multiple online accounts and each gets its own color so that they're easy to tell apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 also handles office documents thanks to the preinstalled Quickoffice application. The Adobe PDF reader is also here to take care of those .PDF files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the preinstalled Quickoffice version doesn?t support editing, but we doubt much of the 700 target audience will need it anyway. If you insist, you can get the paid upgrade and enable editing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator application is very familiar but it lacks the functionality of some of its competitors. The square root is the most advanced function it handles and this is hardly an achievement. If all you do with it is split the bill at the bar though, you're more than good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a dictionary, voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. The good unit converter we?ve come to know from Symbian^1 is strangely gone but you can grab one yourselves at the Nokia store for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application can juggle as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, set-off day and repeat pattern. As we already mentioned, thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone over.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Social networking integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 is quite a social device, as demonstrated in the phone book. The Social app however is the nexus for all things social - it supports the two most popular networks, Facebook and Twitter. You can have multiple accounts on each network but only one of each can be active at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook section offers a wide range of options with an easy to use, touch-optimized user interface. Posting a status update is simple as is attaching a photo or video (or shooting new ones on the spot) as well as adding geotagging data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Twitter is accessed via a similarly neat interface. There's a handy button to shorten links and you can attach photos and videos to your tweets as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text input field for status updates for both Facebook and Twitter covers only the top half of the screen and the portrait QWERTY fits at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature is the All Activity section that becomes available when you add both Facebook and Twitter accounts. It pulls status updates from both networks into a single list. You can also post a status update on both networks simultaneously from here. Unfortunately, there's no option to post only to one of the networks - you have to go to the network's specific section to do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Friend search also becomes available on both networks - it searches both accounts for a given name.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Same old Nokia Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian is still one of the most popular smartphone OSes in the world but its application store is pretty barren compared to the iOS App Store and Android's Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company has refreshed their Nokia store interface to make it more user-friendly for Symbian^3 and it's what you get on Belle too. And while the UI is indeed very handy to use, the number of apps is somewhat of a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default screen shows a list of featured apps or you can browse the apps available in the Nokia Store by categories ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps track of all the apps you have installed under My stuff. You can now also select where games and apps should be installed and where audio and video should go. That?s nice ? we wish Android had that right from the start.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps comes with free lifetime navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 700 comes with a built-in GPS receiver, which locked onto satellites in just over a minute upon a cold start (A-GPS turned off). Keeping the lock from then on was not an issue for the 700 even in a dense urban environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the best perks of buying a Symbian from Nokia is that you get free voice-guided navigation for life. The voice guidance is currently available in over 70 countries and over 40 different languages, with even traffic information for more than 10 of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Nokia did a pretty decent job of the Nokia Maps application itself, giving it a cool, touch-friendly interface, as well as nice features such as location info from Lonely Planet or Qype (you get a different source for the different locations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Nokia Maps 3.06 you get three different view modes including satellite and terrain maps. Those however do need an internet connection. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand and can be used with preloaded maps. Starting with v3.06 can download maps directly on the phone, no computer needed anymore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Routes can be set to either fastest or shortest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Maps is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map. Nokia Maps 3.06 also joins in on the location check-in craze and supports a long list of networks (but not Foursquare, understandably).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's missing is the "More" option we've seen on other installations of Nokia Maps 3.06 - it allowed you to enable extra features like a 5-day weather forecast and Map Reported, which can be used to report map inaccuracies.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, the Nokia 700 is small. It's in no mood though to lie low and wait for the Windows Phones to foot the bill. No sir, the Nokia 700 will earn its keep. While Nokia are still honeymooning with Microsoft, it's good old Symbian holding the fort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two things. It's good old Symbian but not quite. Forget about old. Since Belle, the OS is no longer living in the past. Secondly, the Nokia 700 is small in stature only. Full of character.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Belle update is to Symbian what a reboot is to a PC that?s been acting up. Fluid and efficient, the OS is more than the sum of its parts. With a proper notification area, flat menu structure and better handling of widgets, Symbian Belle won?t be embarrassed anymore by comparisons with Android. It?s the good looks and the overall feel though that make a massive difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the best thing is users get to enjoy a vastly improved experience on one of the most beautiful phones Nokia ever made. Fast ticking, good looking and built to near perfection, the Nokia 700 is the first Symbian handset in quite a while we are downright impressed with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are things we didn?t like but we don?t think they ruin the overall good impression. The camera is bad enough to be chalked down to a faulty unit. Screen size is an issue too. For all its brilliant image quality, the ClearBlack AMOLED touchscreen isn?t big enough for comfortable typing. There?re still plenty of arguments in favor of the Nokia 700. Free lifetime navigation and a solid connectivity package complete with NFC will let the 1GHz smartphone give its best shot against Android competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have the Facebook-centric Salsa and the likeable Wildfire S. The heavily-accessorized HTC Rhyme looks set to speed past them on a 1GHz CPU but it probably is in a different niche altogether with a 3.7? screen. This is where Sony Ericsson come in with a closer match. The Live with Walkman and the Xperia mini are small but capable Snapdragon-powered smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Wildfire S ? HTC Salsa ? HTC Rhyme</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always though, it?s a great rivalry that makes the game really exciting. This is not your usual brawl between similarly spec?d phones. It?s a beauty contest too, which the brilliant Sony Ericsson Xperia ray and the Nokia 700 have equal chance to win.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's been a while since we've been able to wholeheartedly recommend a Symbian phone as an alternative to a droid. There?s something about the Nokia 700 for sure. A piece of Nordic beauty, a job well done.</paragraph>
