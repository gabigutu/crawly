			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>CES is in full swing and we've seen mountains of new devices, the most interesting of which we took the time to handle. Surprisingly, tablets were a big deal this year, bigger than phones. There were still a lot of smartphone action sure, but the spotlight was on phablets and bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also stopped to look at other interesting tidbits, like NVIDIA's new chipset, really anything that will make a geek's heart thump. Some of the new gadgets are high-profile enough to warrant a dedicated article (Sony's Xperia Z1 Compact, Samsung's Galaxy Pro tablets, the new Huawei Ascend Mate 2 4G).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Others grabbed our attention, but with so many new things flying around they'll have to share this space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're still going around booths, snapping photos of the devices and asking about them, so we'll be updating this article with more info as it becomes available.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>NVIDIA Tegra K1 graphics demo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We stopped by the NVIDIA booth at CES for a quick demo of the company's new Tegra K1 chipset. In case you missed it, the K1 will handle a heavier load of graphics than the already powerful Tegra 4. It's based on the Kepler architecture NVIDIA uses for its desktop GPUs and the K1 has a whopping 192 cores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In comparison, the Tegra 4 had 72 cores (older generation too). NVIDIA says the K1 GPU is more powerful than the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and has about three times the oomph of the iPhone 5s' GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this processing power enables lifelike graphics as the one you can see in the demo. Check the one minute mark to see a comparison of the graphic enhancements enabled by the Kepler architecture (it's DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4.4 enabled).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the processor, the Tegra K1 will come in two flavors: a quad-core Cortex-A15 version (clocked at 2.3GHz), which will be out first, with a dual-core Denver (ARMv8, 64-bit, clocked at 2.5GHz), to follow and offer even more power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, NVIDIA will be offering the K1 in a Visual Computing Module version aimed at car infotainment systems. It's no coincidence that NVIDIA is a founding member of the Open Automotive Alliance.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Alcatel One Touch Idol X+<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Alcatel has been doing well lately with a number of low to midrange Android phones, but with the One Touch Idol X+ the manufacturer gave a high-end device a good try.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is built around a 5" 1080p screen and MediaTek's octa-core chipset. The screen is sharp with good image quality (Alcatel's custom UI is very colorful, which really brings out the quality of the screen). It's covered by Dragontrail glass (a lesser known alternative of Gorilla Glass) with fingerprint-resistant coating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alcatel calls it a "borderless, edge-to-edge" design and the screen bezels are indeed quite slim. The device itself is pleasantly thin too, at 7.9mm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MediaTek MT6592 chipset packs eight Cortex-A7 cores clocked at 2GHz. A7 isn't the top CPU core, but we've seen it perform splendidly in something like the Moto G (which had half the cores at almost half the clockspeed). 2GB of RAM and PowerVR SGX544 provide a smooth experience, though the Idol X+ runs a slightly outdated OS - Android 4.2.2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned the vendor customizations - the good news is that they appear minimal and other than boosting the color palette stay pretty close to Android's flat looks. One interesting change is a custom camera app with live filters and a proprietary spherical panorama option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of the camera, it's a 13MP shooter that can record 1080p video. There's a 2.1MP front-facing cam too. There's 16GB of built-in storage, expandable via the microSD card slot. The phone is powered by a 2,500mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One place where Alcatel attempts to set the One Touch Idol X+ apart is audio - there's support for SACD 24bit/192kHz audio playback. The sound tech in the Idol X+ was co-developed with JBL, which will also be providing the headset for the phone. Unfortunately, the CES floor is much too loud to properly test how it sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the phone has 3G HSPA connectivity (it's targeted at countries where LTE isn't available yet). Some versions of the Idol X+ will have dual-SIM support too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Vibe Z hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo has released its first LTE smartphone in the new Vibe Z. It operates on LTE bands up to 2100, and is powered by a quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor clocked at 2.2GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It features a 5.5" fullHD IPS display with a pixel density of almost 400ppi sharp. The Vibe Z is impressively elegant at the mere 7.9mm thick, and a weight of 147g. Inside, there's 2GB of RAM, 16GB of inbuilt storage, and a 3000 mAh battery. Android 4.3 Jelly Bean is the OS version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP primary shooter has an f1.8 aperture, and it's accompanied by LED flash. A 5MP front-facer is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Vibe Z is fairly wide to accommodate the 5.5" screen, but features a textured back panel that helps handling. It's available in both Silver and (darker) Titanium color options, with the glossy metal plate at the bottom more prominent in Silver.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo S930 and S650 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Also introduced were a pair of midrangers in the Lenovo S930 and Lenovo S650. The S930 is the larger-screened of the two, with a 6-inch 720p display, featuring a robust 3000mAh battery and slightly better 1.6MP front-facing camera. The S650 has a 4.7-inch qHD display, a 0.3MP front-facer, and 2000mAh of juice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, both devices are near identical, with quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek chipsets, 8MP primary cameras, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. Both are powered by Android 4.2 Jelly Bean. The S930 has the added benefit of having dual front-facing speakers powered by Dolby Digital Plus DS1, while the S650 comes with dual-SIM support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both new S models follow the design scheme introduced by the Vibe Z, including the "laser-etched fabric-feel" rear cover and silver plate along the bottom and are available only in Silver.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo A859 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, Lenovo have added to their A series of smartphones with the new A859. It features the same quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek 6582 processor as the two new S devices, and also runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It sports a 5-inch 720p display, and has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of expandable storage. Like the S650, it also has dual-SIM support, but comes with the 1.6MP front-facing shooter of the S930. Under the hood is a 2250 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The A859 doesn't have the new textured back panel and metal accent of the other new Lenovo devices, featuring instead a rather disappointing slick glossy polycarbonate back that's rather prone to fingerprints. At 9.2mm it's not the thinnest 5-incher around either, but if priced right it could make a name for itself in the budget range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of pricing, the Lenovo A859 comes in at $219, and goes on sale today in all markets where Lenovo smartphones are sold. The same applies to the S930 and S650, which will be priced at $319 and $229, respectively. The new Vibe Z flagship will be priced at $549, and will see a limited initial release in parts of Southeast Asia and the Middle East, although it's to expect wider availability.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Micromax Canvas LapTab hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Micromax has just unveiled its new Canvas Laptab at CES 2014. It's part of a new trend of devices that's able to dual-boot both Android 4.2.2 and Windows 8.1, and seamlessly switch between them. It's part of Intel's new "dual OS platform" technology that allows you to run both OSs on a single device, and we already saw it in action on Asus's Transformer Book Duet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LapTab comes with a 1280 x 800 pixel 10.1" display, as well as a pair of 2MP cameras on the front and back. Inside is a 1.46GHz Intel Celeron processor, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage expandable via the microSD card slot. The hybrid is powered by a 7,400mAh battery, and comes with miniHDMI and USB 3.0, which is a nice surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tablet weighs in at 650g and is just under 10mm thick, which is about average for the class. The Celeron processor won't give you as good a kick as the Core i3, i5, or i7 powering most Windows notebooks, but it'll hopefully be priced competitively enough .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LapTab comes with an optional snap-on wireless Bluetooth keyboard cover that's also detachable from the back panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Expect the Micromax Canvas LapTab to go on sale starting next month.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xiaomi MI-3 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi has yet to push for a global reach of its devices, but the smartphone maker was at CES and we got to handle the MI-3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an Android-powered phone but Xiaomi uses a custom interface - MIUI v5 built on Android 4.2. The skin looks and feels quite different, and so does the device itself - the MI-3 is a clean break from previous designs. It's rectangular, with rounded sides and flat top and bottom. It's similar to the Nokia N9 and 800, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It helps that the phone is just 8.1mm thick and that's uniform thickness too (no cheating with camera bumps). The bezels are pretty big though, making it the same size as the Sony Xperia Z1. Anyway, the MI-3 exterior is a plastic unibody, but there's a magnesium alloy frame on the inside. At 145g it's a tad heavier than, say, the Galaxy S4, but till a good 25g lighter than the Xperia Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi MI-3 follows the current Android trend with a 5" 1080p screen, which is protected by Gorilla Glass. Xiaomi uses IPS displays from Sharp or LG and the capacitive sensor can detect touches through gloves. Below the screen are three capacitive keys - Menu, Home and Back - but again, Xiaomi uses a custom software that's optimized for this setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera has a Sony Exmor sensor, a 28mm lens with f/2.2 aperture. Next to the camera lens around back, there's a Philips dual-LED flash and an extra mic. Xiaomi took a page out of Apple's book with that sapphire lens. Under the back cover there's a 3,050mAh battery, which is more than most 5" phones but again, the MI-3 is bigger than most 5" phones and the Xperia Z1 has a 3,000mAh battery too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is powered by either Snapdragon 800 or Tegra 4, depending on which 3G tech the respective carrier uses (WCDMA and TD-SCDMA respectively). Strangely, there doesn't seem to be LTE support on either version. Other than 3G, the MI-3 boasts dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC connectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSIM card slot is on top, next to the 3.5mm audio jack. On the opposite side of the phone there's the microUSB port and the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi MI-3 doesn't have a microSD card slot but the storage options are 16GB and 64GB. There's no middle step though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ZTE Grand SII LTE hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This season's new flagship from ZTE has been revealed to be the ZTE Grand SII LTE. With it, ZTE joins the Snapdragon 800 club with four 2.3GHz Krait 400 cores, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen diagonal has grown to 5.5 inches, but this time around ZTE wasn't able to match the razor-thin 6.9mm of thickness of the original Grand S, but that's likely due to having to squeeze in a much larger 3,000mAh battery to power the robust processor and larger screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Grand SII LTE features the same 13MP 1080p-capable shooter complemented by a 2MP front-facer. Like its predecessor (and as its name suggests), features 4G LTE support. It's available in Black, White, and Pink color variants.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>ZTE nubia Z5S hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new nubia Z5S from ZTE is a sequel to the original nubia Z5, and offers a 5-inch 1080p screen, this time of the IGZO variety. ZTE have thrown a boatload of goodies into the Z5S, including a 2.3GHz quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU, 4K video recording and OIS on the 13MP shooter, the new WiFi ac standard, and even an IR port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z5S manages to retain its slim 7.6mm waistline, and even trims the height and width by a few hairs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IGZO fullHD panel provides great colors and viewing angles, resulting in a pleasant viewing experience on par with the best 5-inch 1080p displays out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP primary camera features optical image stabilization as well as the ability to record in 4K UHD resolution. We're eager to see how it stacks up to other 2160p-capable cameras, like the Galaxy Note 3. As an added bonus, the front-facer has been bumped up to 5MP for those who like selfies.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Iconic Phablet hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>ZTE's new 5.7-inch phablet dubbed the Iconic Phablet relies on a 720p display that stretches rather thin at this range, although the pixel density isn't terrible at 258ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The specs are decidedly midrange, however, with 8GB of inbuilt memory, 1GB of RAM, and an 8MP camera with 1MP front-facer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet operates on CDMA bands 800 / 1900 and LTE, but judging by the meager specs sheet it's likely targeted at developing markets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlueWatch hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not one to get left behind in the wearable tech game, ZTE has unveiled its first smartwatch offering in the ZTE BlueWatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's very similar to the crowdfunded Pebble smartwatch not only in terms of appearance, but in functionality as well. It has the same three buttons on the left and one on the right, huge bezels, and even copies its 1.26-inch 144 x 168 pixel display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gionee Elife E7 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Chinese phonemaker Gionee hasn't been the most prominent player in the smartphone market, but the company wants to start making dents with its latest offering - the Elife E7. The Elife E7 is said to pack the best Android camera in the market and at least on paper it's hard to argue with that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's why we were eager to pay the Gionee booth a visit and see for ourselves what the phone is all about. The device itself was announced at the end of November last year and its CES 2014 appearance marks its US debut, which is in line with the company's plans for distribution outside China in early 2014.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyhow, let's start with the exterior of the Elife E7. It's built around a 5.5" TFT LCD display made by Japan Display Inc. (created by Toshiba, Hitachi, Sony and INCJ). At 1080p resolution the screen is quite sharp, having a pixel density of 400ppi. On top of it lies a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3 for extra scratch resistance and shutter protection. Overall, it's a very good display that we liked at first sight. Colors look good and viewing angles aren't too bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display we find the Android trio of capacitive buttons, which could've been better lit up, but that's just our personal preference talking. The Elife E7 is made of plastic, which feels nice in hand. It's a glossy kind of plastic, which means it picks up fingerprints in no time. Nevertheless, it feels very sturdy and solid when held in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the Elife E7's profile goes - at 9.7mm thick the smartphone feels notably thicker than most of its flagship rivals, but it's nothing we cannot live with. Plus the extra thickness has allowed Gionee to put the most powerful version of the Snapdragon 800 chipset inside - the MSM8974AC, which has its quad-core Krait CPU running at 2.5GHz. It also packs an Adreno 330 GPU and 3GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone runs Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean with a special UI that Gionee has called AMIGO 2.0. As a result, there's a wide range of customized applications and widgets. Despite the additional weight that AMIGO 2.0 has added, the phone flies and doesn't think twice about anything you throw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the 32GB of internal storage (for the 4G LTE model) aren't augmented by a microSD card slot. There's more bad news when we move onto the back - the 2,500mAh battery isn't removable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the flipside, the 16MP autofocus camera with LED flash promises to be quite the shooter. Its sensor is large enough, allowing for 1.34µm pixels even at this resolution - higher than what we're used to seeing in most flagship phones out there. The primary lens is based on the Largan M8 solution and is said to deliver sharp images. Unfortunately, we were unable to snap a few photos and check out the quality for real.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gionee has big plans for the Elife E7, which has a bunch of versions. First up, there's the flagship packing LTE connectivity. It's also the most expensive of the bunch at $570, while the 3G variant comes with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage and a lower price tag of $440. There's an "in the middle" version, too, with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, which would cost you $530.</paragraph>
