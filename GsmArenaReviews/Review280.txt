			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you spend your days in the big city, winter hardly feels like a fun season. But once you step outside of the city's boundaries, the sweeping vistas of the snowy slopes make for some of the best photo opportunities. And regardless whether you ski or not, we bet you would be interested to see which cameraphone is best geared for a winter trip to the mountain. To answer this one, we grabbed some of the hottest phablets of the season - the Apple iPhone 6s Plus, the LG V10, and the Samsung Galaxy Note5 - and took them for a ride up the mountain to see how they handle the cold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We wanted to include the recently announced Huawei Mate 8 as well, but it turned out most of its photos were out of focus due to reportedly, a software issue, which should be fixed soon. We still snapped a few keepers with it, so you'll see it featured here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Coincidentally, the Meizu Pro 5 was with us on our little mountain trip, and we're glad it was as it will fill in the Mate8 shoes as the fourth phablet competitor. Meizu may not be such a popular brand in Europe or the USA, but the Meizu PRO 5 camera produces some spectacular daylight shots, so we're sure it will be up to the challenge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Best of all, we captured our field test trip on video. Since it contains potential spoilers regarding the results that we got, we've embedded it on the last page of this article.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, if you don't feel reading the whole thing, you can skip directly to the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, meet our lead stars, the three mountaineers ready to take on a snowy adventure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPhone 6s Plus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 6s Plus has the smallest screen of all compared phones, but it's the biggest screen Apple offers. The Live Photos feature also provides an innovative way of capturing short, action-packed video scenes on the slopes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG V10<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG has an extra durable design and as a nice break from the current crop of flagships, you can swap its battery for a fresh one once you've gone through its charge. There is also a microSD slot. Our previous camera shootouts confirmed it's also got one of the best cameras - be it day or night. We'll have to see whether it can hold its own up high on the mountain slopes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now that the Samsung Galaxy Note5 is finally about to become available in Europe, the interest in this flagship phablet is higher than ever. And for good reason - it should be cheaper than the identically equipped Galaxy Edge+ and it offers the industry-leading S-Pen. It also provides a high sensitivity touchscreen out of the box so you can use it with the gloves on when out in the cold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't replace the batteries of both the Meizu Pro 5 and the Huawei Mate 8, but the Mate 8 is the only other phone besides the Note5 that has a dedicated glove mode. And that's an important consideration when we're talking -10C temperatures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, this should be enough of a presentation - we bet you already know these devices in and out. Let's see how good their cameras would be when faced with lots of sun and snow.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Daylight samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can't climb a mountain without coming across at least one of these huts. We decided this one would be an excellent starter for our snowy shootout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the second scene we chose a beautiful scenery, which has a little bit of everything - snow, bushes, pine forests and beautiful mountain peaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then we snapped some snow-covered trees and bushes at a closer distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In these samples the LG V10 captures the widest and sharpest images, which is great, but doesn't automatically makes it the best. With a golden tinge, the iPhone 6s Plus takes more eye-pleasing images than the V10, but the lower resolution means it captures fewer of the finer details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note5 is the middle ground - they are good in color reproduction and contrast, and even though they may not be as sharp as the V10's, we liked them most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we have to be honest, all of those samples are great and at the end of the day, we'd be happy with either of the cameraphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is another close up of some snowy bushes. Here the Note5 and V10 turned in noisier photos than expected while the iPhone 6s Plus did the best job even though it has the narrower field of view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fifth scene is quite demanding, especially if you don't rely on HDR mode. Surprisingly, the iPhone 6s Plus did the best job here - it was the phone with the highest dynamic range, level of resolved detail, the most accurate colors and the lowest noise levels. Still, the other two phones did great, and if you want a wider FoV, then either of the Note5 and V10 will do just perfect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is another demanding scene with many trees, shadows, and the sun lurking behind those clouds. The iPhone made the picture warmer when it shouldn't while the Note5 achieved the best colors and contrast. The V10 had some tiny issues with the branches here and there, but nothing to ruin the great experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Same conditions, different place puts the V10 a notch before the others with incredible detail and sharpness. The Note5 sample came out softer while the iPhone's - warmer than reality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said earlier - all three phones did great given the conditions, and it's a matter of personal choice really. If you like the wider photos - the Note5 and V10 will suit you better while the iPhone 6s Plus is better for scenes requiring high dynamic range.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Backlight, sunset, and dusk samples<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the toughest pictures to take are the ones where you are shooting against the sun. The iPhone 6s Plus repeatedly got better results than the others, followed by the V10. The Note5 is a hair behind, but still - not bad at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunsets scenes in the winter can be magical. In this case, even though it doesn't have the widest FoV, the iPhone did the best job in outing excellent detail and contrast in both the foreground and background. Colors were on the spot, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The V10 did a commendable job, but there is noticeable corner softness. The Note5 was also superb, but its detail and sharpness aren't as impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are shooting against the sun, the LG V10 did awesome, followed by the iPhone 6s Plus - even though the HDR option was off, it did great in both foreground and background. The Note5 also outed a beautiful photo, but not as great as the one by the V10 and the iPhone 6s Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we snapped one more photo just before the sun dropped below the skyline. The LG V10 captured the most details from the city in the background, and it resolved the most detail, but the picture is warmer than it was.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone did the best job out of the old ski lift construction, but the white balance is off. Note5 was the one to get most of the things right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first samples shot at dusk put the iPhone and the Mate 8 before the V10 and Note5 when it comes to accurate colors and white balance. The iPhone was also the one to bring out most detail in the old ski-lift installation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you are to shoot just snow in dusk conditions, the Mate 8 may disappoint you. The Galaxy Note5 did great here with high detail, and accurate colors and contrast but the iPhone got the white balance right and were second best only because of its lower resolution. The V10 got an improperly dark exposure (softer even) while the Mate 8 got the colors seriously wrong.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Panorama<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We snapped a few panoramic photos with all four devices, and all of them did amazingly well. They all offer high resolution, high dynamic range, accurate colors and plenty of detail. If you want to shoot pano shots - any of these cameraphones will do.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Glove mode<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Modern day capacitive touchscreens require the conductivity of human skin to register a touch. On the other hand, using the phone bare-handed in the sub-freezing temperatures up in the mountains is not a pleasant experience, so we appreciate when a smartphone supports a high sensitivity touchscreen mode to allow its use with regular gloves. No doubt, you could get one of those specially made gloves that are compatible with regular touchscreens, but we're talking some of the most expensive smartphones on the market here. Why not expect all bells and whistles, then?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The high sensitivity touch mode or Glove mode, as some call it, usually boosts the screen sensitivity at the expense of battery life so that it can sense your fingers through (not so thick) gloves. The Galaxy Note5 had a high-sensitive mode by default and there is no toggle for that. Thicker gloves, however, would require you to press harder for your fingers to be recognized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate 8 also has a dedicated glove mode and by toggling it to on, you can use its screen with a thicker pair of warm gloves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's worth noting that it was only the Note5 again that allowed us to activate the camera and take a few shots without even touching the screen. You activate the camera by a double tap, and you can take photos using the volume keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mate 8 has a camera shortcut as well - double pressing the volume down button. But the key lacks the responsiveness needed to press it twice in a rapid succession with gloved fingers or with cold fingers, for that matter. So it's almost as if the feature wasn't there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling the Apple iPhone 6s Plus and the Samsung Galaxy Note5 is far from ideal, especially in cold weather. If you are using the phones without gloves - with numb and clumsy hands - there is a substantial risk of dropping them. Even with fingers, the slippery phones are still quite easy to drop. We strongly recommend opting for some case before taking either of the phones on such an adventure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same applies for the Meizu Pro 5, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand - the plastic and durable LG V10 is perfectly fine to be used outside without a case. The grippy materials provide for an excellent grip, regardless whether you have your gloves on or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate 8 could just as well be used without a case though its metal shell will get quite cold and you won't be able to use it without gloves for long. Luckily, it's in the rare Glove Mode club.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also tested how the phones fared while shooting time lapses and videos in sub-zero temperatures and we're quite happy with how they fared. Cold weather can be quite taxing on any battery and even though our tests are far from scientific, the phones seemingly handled the exposure to cold differently, so it's worth going through our findings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone 6s Plus was the only one that turned off far before its battery was fully depleted on several occasions - and always around the 25%-35% mark. Once we brought it back to a warmer environment, it booted nicely and kept working.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG V10 battery was quite sensitive to the cold as well, and its battery was exhausted quicker than usual but, at least, it lasted to the very end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPhone saw its battery run flat within the hour while the LG V10 lasted about two hours of video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Note5 and the Mate8 happily endured the cold, losing about a quarter of their battery capacity for each hour of video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real champ was the Meizu PRO 5, which lost only about 10% of its battery capacity for every hour of use in the cold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Make note that sub-zero temperatures are usually far from the comfort zones of most phones and manufacturers advise against such usage.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are to embark on snowy adventures and you intend to use your smartphone as the designated camera - then any of these high-profile smartphones will do the job quite well. If you are pixel peeping, you may find few pros and cons on each, but at the end of the day, none of this will matter when sharing on social networks as they downsize the images anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As promised in the beginning, here's our field test video, which gets into more detail about how we went about doing the whole thing. It also features some behind the scenes footage that you may find interesting as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we have any tips to take from our short trip, the top one would be to get yourself a pair of capacitive touch gloves - those would make your life easier and will keep your fingers warmer through the day and less likely to drop the phone, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, having a protective case around your device is a great tip as well for winter conditions - not only to protect the device from the elements but more importantly, to allow for easier and more precise handling with gloves or with frozen fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery of the iPhone, in particular, seems to have issues with sub-freezing temperatures, but in any case, if you are going to spend the day in the mountain shooting, we recommend carrying a few external battery packs on you, whichever the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hopefully, these tips would come in handy on your next upcoming ski trips and mountain adventures. Just don't forget the Winter may be beautiful, but it is also dangerous, so be prepared.</paragraph>
