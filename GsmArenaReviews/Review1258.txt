			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar is the smaller, less expensive, less powerful and - overall - less exaggerated version of the Titan. Now, turn that around and the Radar will be the sensible, down-to-earth and friendlier phone of the two. It will be up to users to decide. HTC do need both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have been on home turf in the Windows Phone game so far. LG and Samsung didn?t really take the first complete makeover of the platform to heart, allowing the Taiwanese to capture more than half of the WP7 market share. Now though, with the emergence of Nokia, HTC will have a harder time asserting their supremacy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar is a good-looking - though far from flashy - and well-built smartphone. It's a WP7.5 Mango-running 1GHz powered package with a fairly palatable price tag hanging off that aluminum unibody. Sure, it may not be the upgrader?s dream, but it will probably tick plenty of boxes for those that are only now considering giving the platform a go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A year ago when Microsoft launched it, Windows Phone 7 was refreshingly different and quite pretty, but still too immature to be able to cover as much ground as its maker hoped. The Mango update brings WP closer to its competitors and while Android and iOS haven't been idle either, WP7.5 has a better chance at making a difference in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's fair is fair - Android has zoomed ahead on dual-core and HD screens. It's not up to the likes of the HTC Radar though to push hard and catch up. WP needs a foothold in the midrange and the second generation of phones may help the platform get it. The HTC Radar for its part doesn?t target upgraders - being pretty much the same phone as the 7 Trophy. It's mostly the software updates that will be trying to convince the fence-sitters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And Mango does well to address some of the lacking functionality. Before we get to that though, there's the usual unboxing and hardware checkup. It's a proper unibody - at long last. We'd love a taste of the traditional HTC premium feel and solid build.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar?s retail package is fairly standard. You get a one-piece headset, a microUSB cable and a detachable charger plug that uses the USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone doesn?t support microSD cards yet, so you couldn?t expect to find one in here. A carrying pouch would be too much to ask at that price - not that the supposedly premium Titan had one either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Radar 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 120.5 x 61.5 x 10.9 mm and 137 g the HTC Radar is not the most compact, nor is it the lightest of smartphones to feature a 3.8? screen. But it doesn?t come across as bulky either and the suave aluminum unibody is worth the fuss of carrying the extra weight. At least for us it is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar is a well-built and handsome smartphone. Designed to minimalism and good ergonomics, there?s little to frown at in terms of styling and hand feel. You can't go wrong with an aluminum unibody, and the HTC Flyer-inspired rubberized plastic accents at the back add to its appeal. The device could have been slimmer perhaps, but that's nit-picking really. The worse things to consider are the lack of a memory slot and the sealed battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.8" S-LCD screen of the HTC Radar comes with the WP-standard WVGA resolution. It's hardly the best there is - neither its contrast, nor its pixel density are close to the market-leaders, but then again, good luck getting some of them on the same budget as the Radar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So we should probably be pleased with the decent viewing angles and sunlight legibility on offer and not get too particular. AMOLED screens certainly do the Windows Phone OS more justice as their deep blacks are quite important here. The Samsung Focus Flash I677, which we reviewed not long ago, is a good example. Anyway, the HTC Radar is by no means let down by its LCD display. In fact, the Radar seems to offer better performance outdoors than the older HTC 7 Trophy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the HTC Radar's screen there's a secondary 1.3 MP video-call camera, a proximity sensor and an ambient light sensor. Three haptic-enabled capacitive controls are placed below the 3.8" display. The Back, Home and Search keys are well-spaced and nicely backlit in white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the HTC Radar is where the volume rocker and camera button are. The shutter key is a bit too slim, but soft and springy, with very distinct half and full press. Pressing and holding the key will unlock the phone and launch the camera right from the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing on the left is the microUSB port. It's got no protective cover to keep it from filling with dust. The port is near the bottom, which some might find uncomfortable for working with the phone while charging. It would be particularly difficult for left-handed users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the HTC Radar features the 3.5 mm audio jack and the power/lock button. No usability issues with either of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the Radar we find nothing but the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Radar features the 5 MP camera lens and LED flash. There's also a loudspeaker grill and a Windows Phone logo at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the cover at its very bottom lets you insert a SIM card, but you cannot access the battery. That comes with the unibody ? on the upside the phone is solidly built and a pleasure to handle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Radar got a 34h rating in our dedicated battery test, which means you should expect about 34 hours between charges if your usage pattern involves an hour of browsing, video playback and 3G calls each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar is well put together, with great hand feel and likely to last. It may not have the massive screen of the HTC Titan, but that?s not necessarily all bad. For one, it's much easier to squeeze in a pocket and way more comfortable for single-handed use. The WVGA resolution is a better match of the screen size too ? low pixel density failed the Titan at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re about to move on to the Windows Phone Mango inside the Radar. The updated software is the main advantage of a phone that altogether lacks the novelty factor. HTC didn?t have the liberty of skinning the user interface as heavily as they do in Android, but they obviously couldn?t resist the temptation of sneaking some of their Sense UI niceties in.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Phone gets a taste of Mango<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar's user interface is the same Windows Phone one you'll get on any competing device running the OS. The only differentiating thing is the HTC green preloaded as a theme color. The interface is very clean and simple - it's comprised of live tiles that show information like the current date, calendar events, missed calls, unread emails and more, all without the need to open up any of the applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pushing the unlock button reveals the lock screen, which displays the current time and date and shows calendar events, emails and missed calls. The background of the lock screen can be changed from either the settings menu or from the picture gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping the lockscreen up unlocks the device and reveals the live-tile Metro user interface. It's a very fluid vertical grid of Live tiles that shows one or two tiles organized in bricked style. Each of these can be reorganized by which ever order you like and you can place almost anything in the grid by holding your finger over it and selecting the Pin to start option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Live tiles, the basic building blocks of the Start screen of Windows Phone have been revamped. Now they are quicker and offer more info. For example, the Pictures tile shows an animated slideshow of your images. The Group tile (Groups is a new feature to boot) lists friend updates. The application list has grown a virtual Search button, which makes finding apps easier for those with many apps installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo of the Radar in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the main novelties brought by the latest WP build - 7.5 Mango - is multitasking. It still isn't true multitasking; things are being done the iOS way. Apps not in the foreground are suspended, but the OS has ways to take over and carry out the task for them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We only worry that this logic can be too restrictive for some apps, but we'll see how things pan out. Of course, there will be a transitional period when some apps will support multitasking and others won't. We've been there with the iOS, when it first left the realm of single-tasking ? it?s not that bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, to switch between apps you press and hold the Back key (that's right, the Back key, not the Windows key). The app switcher itself looks similar to that of Symbian or WebOS: thumbnail snapshots of the apps, ordered chronologically left to right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can scroll the list horizontally to select an app and a tap will bring you back to exactly how you left it. Usually, the last 5-6 apps are here. You can't "kill" any of those apps, this is more of a history of the recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eventually, as you open more apps, the old ones start to drop out of the list. Once an app is gone, you have to launch it again the old fashioned way, which has the drawback of starting it over from the beginning. Finally apps with active background tasks (e.g. streaming online radio) will keep on working.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multitasking can be disabled from the settings to save battery. There you'll also find a list of all installed apps that support multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the settings menu reveals two sets of options - system and applications. System covers all the settings you can think of like sounds, color theme, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Accounts, etc. The Applications settings enables you to configure individual settings for each app you have installed on the device - the People hub, Phone, Maps and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7.5 can be controlled through voice only - you can dictate a text, have the phone read out the reply, you can initiate searches and so on. Other OSes are doing it too (*cough*Android*cough*) but voice commands are a big part of iOS (and a loudly touted one at that), so WP7.5 can brag about it too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The People hub from Windows Phone 7 was impressive, but the 7.5 update makes it absolutely brilliant. Part of that is due to the better social network support, complete with Twitter and LinkedIn.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is pretty much the same. You still get the clever way of jumping to contacts starting with a specific letter, the What's new tab that aggregates status updates from all contacts and the Recent tab, which lists only recently viewed contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And deeper social networking support makes things even better. When viewing a contact's profile, you get everything from call, text, send email, write on wall, mention on Twitter and so on. The contact photo, along with the latest status update, are visible on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The What's new tab works like its namesake in the People hub, but only shows updates from the specific contact. Pictures is where the contact's Facebook albums are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting addition is the new History tab. The complete history of exchange with a contact is in one place listed by day. Everything but status updates is listed here - calls, texts (actually threads from the Messaging hub) and emails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new features of the hub is Groups, a handy way to organize your contacts, with "text everyone" and "email everyone" features. All the status updates from the grouped contacts are pulled in from their various social networks, and you get access to their online photo albums too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Groups can also be pinned to the homescreen for easier access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Me card is your own profile. From here you can post status updates, set chat status, check into locations (there's more location goodness coming on later). You can also change your profile picture (only for Facebook and Live though, not Twitter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another tab in the Me card lets you view notifications (e.g. Twitter mentions) and, finally, What's new lets you view your own status updates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>People Hub as a phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People hub is present in the Phone app too. It takes the form of a contacts tab but only instead of contacts, you have people with profiles ? a term taken right out of social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first screen of the People hub shows you a list of all your contacts (phone contacts, social network friends, email pen friends ? everything), with a search shortcut and an add contact button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are ordered alphabetically, indexed with colored squares with a letter. You can tap any one of those letters boxes and the screen shows you the whole alphabet highlighting the letters actually in use. You can tap a letter to scroll to that part of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be sorted by either first name or last and they can be displayed as ?First Last? or ?Last, First? (the two settings are separate), you can also include or exclude Facebook friends, import only Facebook contacts that have a phone number and add several accounts to sync with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping to the side shows only new events from all contacts from social networks. Another swipe shows the recently called contacts. Instead of favorites, you can pin a contact to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact?s profile shows the contact photo. Below that there are actions ? ?call mobile?, ?text mobile?, ?write on wall?, ?view website? and so on. Below each actions, in smaller type and grey or blue letters, are the target for the action (e.g. phone number, email, site URL) and where that info came from (Google, Facebook, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft keys let you pin a contact, link two (or more) contacts from the various services and edit. Swiping to the side brings out the ?What?s new? panel?, which shows the latest updates and events just from that contact.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony is good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Call reception on the HTC Radar was good and it held on to signal even in closed quarters where by default the signal bars drop a few. In-call sound quality is brilliant and loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone application shows you the call history, with shortcuts to voice mail, dialer and phonebook. The phone live tile will show the number of missed calls as will the lock screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer itself is as simple as it gets ? a phone keypad with a Call and a Save button. The lack of smart dialing is an annoyance, but the People hub is good at finding contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use voice dialing instead - the HTC Radar did good in recognizing our commands, though it did have issues separating the two Dexter's in our contact list - "Dexter" and "Dexter Morgan". Still, it did recognize the unusual name "Mandark".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting option is the International assist ? it comes in handy for dialing while abroad or calling someone outside the country. What?s missing is the ability to set any song from your collection as a ringtone ? a feature some of you might miss. You can download new ringtones from the Marketplace though (possibly at some cost though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When there?s an incoming call, the contact?s photo will appear full screen and you can slide up to reveal the answer and reject call buttons. This will prevent any accidentally answered or rejected calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick note ? status indicators are hidden by default (except the clock) but you can bring them up with a quick tap on the very top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did our traditional loudspeaker test on the HTC Radar and it got a Good mark. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All-round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging was heavily retooled for version 7.5. Threads are the building blocks of all non-email messaging. Although a sort of conversation view, threads mash together SMS, Facebook and Windows Live messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's the thing about Windows Phone: the Messaging hub removes the old division between texts, IMs, social messages. The other hubs do the same for the other functionality, making the whole thing simple yet powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, Messaging is separated into two tabs - threads and online. Online shows you who's online with the people you've talked to most recently on top. This makes finding someone to talk to very easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threads is where this hub's impressive features kick in. A new thread is created for each person you start a chat with. Messages are displayed as speech balloons and a label on the left shows the type of message - text, Facebook or Live Messenger. Labels are placed only when the conversation moves to a different platform so it's not cluttered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which platform to use to send a reply and the text box will remind you what you're currently using with a message like "chat on Facebook". Individual messages can be copied (the whole message is copied to be pasted later, you can't copy only a part of the message), they can be deleted or forwarded. Whole threads can be deleted too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can't attach anything to Facebook messages, you'll need to use MMS for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The visual voicemail functionality is also part of the new OS (that is dependant on the carrier and your plan). It works as you would expect, by letting you read your voicemail messages instead of listening to them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email where Mango contributed too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the highly requested feature was a unified inbox for email - and Windows Phone 7.5 delivers. You can now link multiple inboxes (and unlink them individually later), so that you have a single place to check for new messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking several inboxes will also automatically combine their live tiles. You can browse individual folders for each account, which lets you view messages from only one email account even if it's linked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Conversation view was expected - it lists emails between you and a contact chronologically, grouping them by subject. It?s the display style that Gmail popularized and is the best way to keep track of a conversation over email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each email conversation is listed with a subject and number of messages, plus how many of those are new. A tap on a conversation expands it to show the messages plus a line from each message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can tap on an individual message to read it, as well as skip messages back and forward to navigate the conversation. We expected to be able to swipe between the messages, but that wasn?t the case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can mark individual emails, make them read/unread, set flag, clear flag and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text input on Windows Phone constitutes of the default QWERTY keyboard and offers portrait and landscape modes - that's it. The layout remains the same on all WP devices and the only options you have are changing the language of the keyboard and resetting the dictionary that displays word suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP QWERTY keyboard is very comfortable to use and offers sound feedback. There's no haptic vibration feedback and there's no way of enabling it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard comes in many sizes, depending on the device. On the HTC Radar it's very comfortable and given that currently the smallest WP7 screen found on a phone is 3.5" there can't be any size complaints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally you can search your entire mail for individual emails - it's a very useful feature, especially for those with large inboxes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text selection and copy-paste functionality were desired functions even before the 7.5 Mango update. They became a reality with the pre-Mango No-Do update. Selecting text is very simple, but does require some getting used to. You hold your finger over some text for a second or two and then release. The text area gets highlighted and then you can move the beginning and end cursors to adjust how much text you want to select. A little icon pops up for copy and the selected text is available to paste anywhere in the OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-res Picture tile is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Pictures hub has been polished up a bit in Windows Phone Mango. There's a new People tab, which lets you browse photo albums by individual contacts or groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set a single photo as a background for the hub (it used to be the last photo viewed) or you can set it to shuffle different photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, the point of hubs is that they are the go-to place to do things, instead of apps. New functionality allows apps to integrate into the Pictures hub, so for example, a photo effects app can make its options available right in the hub. Devs need to enable that into apps however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main view of the Pictures hub offers four options - camera roll, albums, date and people. A swipe to the left reveals what's new, which displays your Facebook friends and liked pages' new picture galleries. Another swipe shows your favorites section, where the photos you've faved are displayed and finally applications, where on the HTC Radar you'll find the Photo Enhancer app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Albums features the camera roll, the preloaded system pictures and all of your Facebook albums. A flick to the left shows all your pictures sorted by date. You can't assign individual camera roll photos into albums, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The people section is where you can select your friends or closed ones so that their galleries on Facebook get displayed right there in your Pictures hub. It's a nice feature for social network users but will be only an empty section for those that aren't too fond of Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll unifies your entire collection of photos and videos, taken with the device, in a grid of 4x5. You cannot change the view of the camera roll. Viewing a photo can be done in either portrait or landscape mode. Zooming in on a photo is done by either double tap or pinch to zoom. We appreciate that the camera roll doesn't downsize pictures and you can enjoy them in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone 7 used to be quite restricted when it came to sharing - it's still not perfect (it still downsizes photos before emailing them, for one) but you can now share videos too, either via email or on Facebook. Sharing options include messaging, email, Facebook or the cloud-based SkyDrive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While uploading photos to Facebook or Windows Live, the OS will detect any untagged faces and allow you to tag them before proceeding with the upload.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera roll has a dedicated auto-fix setting, which tries to improve your photo. It's a nice feature but one that produces unrealistic results at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player is integrated into the Pictures hub. It has a very simple interface - you have fast forward and rewind controls, a time scroll and a video size button that toggles full-screen viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player doesn?t recognize .AVI files ? in other words, don?t expect DivX or XviD support. However, the Zune software on your computer will automatically convert such files to .MP4 ? so, you can watch those formats on the HTC Radar, it?s just that the transfer to the device can take quite a while (depending on your computer's capabilities).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting (and useful) that you can pin individual items to the homescreen ? like a song or video, even an FM radio frequency.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music + Videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The media players reside together in the Music &amp; Videos hub, which bears the Zune logo. When you start it, it shows the History, which gives you quick access to the last two things played, or you can go to the full menu and start the music or video player, listen/watch podcasts (both audio and video podcasts are supported), start the FM radio or go to the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section is made up of albums, songs, playlists, genres and artists. Videos features all, television, music videos, films and personal - think of them like more of categories you can assign your videos to when synching with Zune. The third section is podcasts where you can store all of your downloaded audio and video podcasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get radio and marketplace links in the Music &amp; Videos tile. It doesn't offer the option to listen to online radio stations so you would need to insert the headgear to get reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the current frequency in very large digits ? swiping left and right changes the frequency and a swipe and release automatically searches for the next available station in that direction. You can mark some stations as favorites, which will allow you to pin them to the homescreen. RDS is on board and you can switch between headphones and loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music has a simple and straightforward interface. You won?t have any difficulties using it. However there are some things missing, like an equalizer. Another missing feature is the ability to scrub through a song with your finger ? you have to press and hold on the FF/rewind buttons to simply jump back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings along a slight change in design to the now playing screen. The favorite, repeat and shuffle buttons are now placed horizontally next to the album cover instead of hidden behind it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar did quite well in our audio output test. The smartphone was decent in both testing scenarios and showed some impressively high volume so the average user will have little to frown at.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the headphones out of the equation, the Radar had good frequency response, great noise levels and dynamic range and little total harmonic distortion. The intermodulation distortion was higher than average though and so was the stereo crosstalk. Volume levels were among the highest we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The results with headphones in were about as good. Volume remained higher than average, while noise levels and dynamic range readings remained excellent. Intermodulation distortion and stereo crosstalk did spike, though, but only the first of those is potentially damaging to the sonic experience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Wide-angle camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar is equipped with a 5 MP autofocus camera with a few tricks under its belt - it utilizes a 28mm wide-angle F2.2 lens and a BSI (back-side illuminated) sensor. The end result is stills of 2560&#x445;1920 resolution. It also features a VGA front-facing camera for self-portraits and video calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the fancy camera specs actually mean in real life is that due to the wide-angle lens you'll be able to fit more into the picture than with other phones. The F2.2 aperture number means that the phone's camera can capture images with more light, which coupled with the BSI sensor produces very well-light images even in darker environments. But more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI is pretty simple ? you have your viewfinder and some controls on the right. From top to bottom they are the still/video camera toggle, second video-call camera toggle, virtual zoom buttons and an extended settings menu. On the left you have an arrow that takes you to the images taken with the camera, alternatively you can do a swipe gesture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app on Windows Phone offers very extensive settings, ranging from scenes and effects to white balance, contrast, saturation, sharpness, ISO and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly the camera key will wake the phone with a single press ? that is unlock it and start the camera. There's an option that prevents the shutter key from starting the camera if the proximity sensor is triggered (to prevent accidental launches when the phone is in your pocket). This option is off by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar's shots turn out bright due to the aperture and BSI sensor but we aren't too happy about the resolved detail it produces. You'll notice clipping in the highlights and a lot of smeared detail due to the noise reduction algorithm. Still if you go as far as 50% zoom the photos look good with nice colors and exposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the HTC Radar full-res camera samples. Enjoy!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also took a macro photo with the HTC Radar. It offers a good macro mode and will give you detailed shots at close up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar steps up in our photo quality compare tool to meet the likes of the Apple iPhone 4 and the Samsung Galaxy S Plus. The tool's page will give you more information on what to look out for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite its f2.2 lens with BSI sensor the HTC Radar isn't among the leaders in resolved detail and falls way behind the 5 MP iPhone. Against a foe like the Galaxy S Plus it does okay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The HTC Radar in the Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HD video recording disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video camera interface is identical to the still camera one and has plenty of features too. You can calibrate contrast, saturation and sharpness, change the white balance or exposure compensation and also add image effects. You can use the LED as a video light too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your captured videos appear in a thumbnail slideshow just as they do in the Pictures hub and Music &amp; videos hub. You get a flash on/off toggle in the settings menu too - the phone uses the LED as a video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar captures 720p videos but doesn't do too well in terms of detail. There's a shamefully low amount of it in the videos we shot. Colors and smoothness turned out fine but we can't help but feel that the HD moniker of the Radar's camcorder is undeserved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's an example of what the HTC Radar's camcorder is capable of.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mango brings enhanced connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar has quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support and dual-band 3G with HSPA (14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local connectivity is covered by Wi-Fi b/g/n with DLNA and stereo Bluetooth 2.1. Bluetooth is currently limited as to what it can do ? there?s no file transfer support, for one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Syncing with a computer is done with the Zune computer application. It?s the only way to transfer files directly between your computer and your Windows Phone ? there's no Mass storage mode, even now with Mango.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync files with Zune over the USB cable and Wi-Fi. There?s a Mac version of available too - Windows Phone 7 Connector. You can check our detailed review of the Zune software here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additional SD storage isn't available on Windows Phone so the HTC Radar doesn't offer such an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another syncing option is the cloud. SkyDrive is a free Microsoft service that gives you 25GB of cloud storage. You can even have your photos automatically uploaded as soon as you snap them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mango brings Wi-Fi hotspot functionality too. All you need is an active SIM card with a data connection and you're all set.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Internet Explorer mobile does without Flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Internet Explorer on Widows Phone was updated to the latest version for the 7.5 update and it improves the user interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar is always visible (but the status bar at the top of the screen is auto-hides, so you don't actually lose any screen real estate) and next to it is the refresh button. You can, of course, bring up the extended settings, which offer a great deal of options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar also serves as a search bar, which is a handy shortcut for looking things up if you're not sure which site exactly will do the job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser interface is quite minimalist - you have only the URL bar at the bottom with a reload icon to the left. Swiping the bar upward reveals shortcuts for tabs, recent, favorites, add to favorites, share page, pin to start and settings. The settings menu offers the usual options like location, allow cookies, delete browsing history but it does offer a very neat option to choose a global preference for mobile or desktop site versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser makes the controls in web pages look just like their equivalents in native apps. So, a web app can look just like a native app with practically no extra effort from the designer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The six tab ceiling hasn?t been lifted - it's not too bad, but competing OSes don't have such limitations. We were also hoping to see text reflow, but no luck on that either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What has changed is performance - the new browser relies on hardware graphics acceleration to provide smoother graphics (and video) and animation and the JavaScript engine has been retooled as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft are so confident that they've set up a page specifically for testing the performance of your phone - both JavaScript and graphics. You can find the page here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't be afraid to pit the phone against even a desktop browser - the tests are pretty demanding and if you're not running a recent version of the major desktop browsers, your computer will surely break a sweat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing search on Windows Phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When you search on Bing, one of the things that might be offered as a relevant result is an app from the Marketplace. For example, searching for "travel" will offer a travel tool app. This feature is called App connect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bing also grew two new search modes - song recognition and barcode scanner. Those are features popular with apps, but with WP7.5 you get those natively as part of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera scanner can also snap a photo of text, perform OCR and translate it into another language.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Marketplace just now catching up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Windows Phone Marketplace is playing catch up with the Apple Appstore and the Android Market. Currently it has north of 38 thousand apps available. It?s organized into four main sections ? applications, games, music and the HTC apps store. A fifth section called Updates shows up when one of your installed apps has received an update ? there's an Update all button, which will save you the hassle of updating each app individually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, each app will be listed with a short description, a rating and user reviews, and a few screenshots. If the app can use something that can potentially breach your privacy (e.g. location information) the Marketplace will let you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not as comprehensive as the Android Market (which lists just about everything the app can use) but on the upside it only warns you about the important things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Big downloads (anything north of 40MB) need a Wi-Fi connection to work. Alternatively, you can download those jumbo apps using the desktop Zune software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Application section starts with a featured app, then it?s on to the categories (including all and free), followed by the top apps, a list of new ones and a longer list of featured apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music section is actually the Zune Marketplace. Its structure is similar to the Application section. First, a featured artist of the week, three more featured artists, then a list of new releases, top albums and genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Genres themselves are separated into sections too ? new releases and top artists/albums/songs/playlists. For each song, you get a 30 second preview (same as iTunes). If you have a Zune pass, you can stream the entire song, just like you would on a Zune player (it?s 10 US dollars a month).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC apps features free HTC-created applications for Windows Phone, like the HTC Hub, Photo enhancer, Notes, the well-known Flashlight app (as seen on Android too) and more. There's a total of 10 apps there but the list should grow in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Games section is divided into Xbox Live, New, Featured and Genres, which is the categories version. A great thing about games in the Windows Phone Marketplace is the try option, which is available to many games and apps. It gives you a trial of a game before you decide to buy it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new and featured sections act as a what's new/hot reference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Marketplace on Windows Phone can be accessed via your WP device, the Zune software on your PC and the windowsphone.com website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Search is available for the Marketplace but right now it pulls together search results from all sections ? games and apps alike. Microsoft have fixed the issue where songs would get mixed up in the search too, which was annoying.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xbox LIVE gaming<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xbox Live is at the heart of the Games hub. It carries over many features from the Xbox ? from your avatar to your scores and achievements. The Spotlight feature is available too (it shows info on new stuff) and also Requests ? which shows you game invites from your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the games themselves are housed in the Collection section. Nothing much to see here, the installed games are arranged in a square grid and there?s a Get more games shortcut, which launches the Marketplace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not all games support Xbox Live ? the ones that do are in the corresponding section in the Marketplace. We did test games like Need for Speed, Kinectimals, Angry birds and had no problems with the HTC Radar, the 1GHz processor and Adreno 205 GPU were more than adequate in handling more complex graphics.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bing Maps lights your path<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Bing Maps is the heart of the Windows Phone "getting around" scene, until Nokia's WP devices come along with full-fledged voice guided navigation for free via Nokia Drive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps is a core part of the Windows Phone experience and there's a new feature that makes version 7.5 a must-have - driving (and pedestrian) navigation for free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, it's not quite voice-guided navigation. Here's how it works: first you set up a route and listen to the first instruction, then when it's time for the next instruction, the phone will beep and highlight it. If you tap it, the phone will read it out to you, but only then.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Maps app uses a big font with white letters on black background that make reading easy. It still requires you to take your eyes off the road though, it won't put SatNav apps out of business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Real-time traffic information is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all the new Maps can do for you though. The app will locate nearby points of interest with the new feature called Local Scout and it will even show you indoor maps of malls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local Scout has a tabbed interface to sort the various points of interest - eat+drink, see+do, shop and highlights. You can pick items from a "I care about" list to get the relevant options only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really cool functionality of Local scout is you can pin places to your homescreen. So let's say you like a pub and like to check it out from time to time, read reviews, call for a reservation - it's right there on your homescreen - that's neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like Bing maps and are especially fond of the Nokia maps integration coming soon - it will heat things up for Google maps. As for Nokia Drive, the full-fledged voice-guided navigation on Windows Phone, we're also eager to check that out. It could land on all WP devices some day.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full-featured Office<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Office is one of the key selling points of Windows Phone. Document viewing and editing is absolutely free and integrated into the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Mango SkyDrive integration is one thing that was improved. Now, docs are automatically synced between the phone and your computer through SkyDrive. In case you missed it, Microsoft are offering free 25GB of storage with each SkyDrive account (but individual files are limited to 100MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more - the Locations tab replaces the old SharePoint tab. This lets you browse Office docs stored on the phone, in SkyDrive, through SharePoint or in Office 365 (a paid service that includes Office web apps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Office hub breaks down into three sections ? Documents, Locations and Notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let?s look at the two most important apps ? Word and Excel. They share the Documents panel, which lists all available documents of the relevant types (in order of last used). Both viewing and editing of files is supported. PowerPoint files live in the Documents section too ? but they are for viewing only, you can?t edit them or create new ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Excel section of the Office hub got better too - it grew the all-time favorite Auto-sum function and you can now tap and drag to select multiple cells.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing is pretty straightforward and easy to use even on a mobile device. You type in the text and you can use the Format key to change the formatting of the selected text. You can also insert comments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Formatting options include the standard bold, italic and underline, as well as text size, highlighting and font color. For highlighting and font colors you have only three colors to choose from, which is a little limiting but should be enough for most cases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Collaboration for both Word and Excel files is enabled with SharePoint. It allows syncing, sharing and web publishing but you?d need to use the right SharePoint server. You can attach those files to emails, though you need to do that from the Office hub. You can't do it from the email editor, which caused a little confusion at first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OneNote is Microsoft?s collaborative note taking tool. It has great (and easy to use) support for lists of multiple levels, you can add photos and voice memos and you can send notes via email when you?re done. OneNotes can be synced with your SkyDrive or Windows Live account so that they are accessible from everywhere. Pin-to-homescreen is available too and so is the To-Do feature that turns the selected line into a to-do item that can be checked off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the apps support pinch zooming and work very well for viewing even complex documents. But Microsoft?s fondness for simplicity may have over-simplified the editors. Still the innovation that Mango has brought to Windows Phone Office is great and shows Microsoft is dedicated to improving the Office experience further.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizing skills on Windows Phone are dully covered and is a place where HTC do much to improve the experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have the usual calendar, alarm, calculator, to-do apps. HTC brings along a very good-looking Notes app, Lists, Calculator, Converter and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Notes app is very straightforward. You have virtual backboard where notes get pinned (you can rearrange them however you want) and turning it over brings up a whiteboard that keeps your notes organized by date of creation. Scribbling a new note is easy - just tap on the sticky notes in the left corner and the QWERTY is brought up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The business side of Windows Phone has its own list of cool updates in version 7.5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar can view sub-calendars for each account you have and you can give each a different color to make it easier to tell apart. You can also disable sub-calendars if they're getting in the way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To-dos can be created too. Those can only be synced with Live accounts, and not a Gmail account for example. Each to-do can have a priority reminder, due date and notes. Later, to-do's can be sorted by priority.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers day and agenda views too for more comprehensive hour-by-hour browsing of your appointments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WP calculator is nothing extravagant - it has the simple portrait view of basically all calculators on the planet, while turning it over to landscape reveals the more complex scientific mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app is simple to use and has an iOS-esque interface. You get the alarm time with an on/off switch to the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows Phone Mango provides users with the basics in smartphone organizing but should you need anything more the Marketplace is there too - it offers apps for just about everything - most of which are free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Windows Phone website is the cloud of sorts for all WP7 smartphones<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All you need to do to use the site is register your email (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) and then setup an account on your Windows Phone device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options given to you on the windowsphone.com website are limited to billing information and security. You can update your billing information, view the apps you've bought and go to the web version of the WP Marketplace and buy new apps. Note that they will be sent to your phone to be downloaded locally on the device, unlike on the Zune app for your PC or Mac.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The features most important to users are the Find, Ring, Lock or Erase. To use them you'll have to input a phone number out of a total of 37 countries. After you've done this the website will have access to your phone's location so you'll be able to pinpoint its almost exact location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other features are pretty self-explanatory - Ring will use your phone's ringtone to send a single if you've lost it around the house, Lock will lock it with a 4-digit PIN code and Erase will wipe all your sensitive data off the device so you don't have to worry about it falling into undesirable hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we didn't like about the windowsphone.com cloud is that it doesn't allow wireless sync like on the iCloud, for example. We just think that any cloud-based service should offer this. Also the number of countries that allow tracking your device is limited and many countries where WP is available won't have access to these much-needed features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the website includes guides on each individual feature of your phone and depending on where you live there's a very detailed list of providers and operators that offer WP handsets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, users of the HTC 7 Trophy can look at the Radar in disbelief all they want. Yes, it?s the same phone they?ve been having for a year now. The Radar won?t stare back at them. Although, it?s got a few things to show: unibody, wireless hotspot functionality courtesy of Mango, a better screen and camera (not so much for the wide-angle lens and backlit sensor as the simply better looking photos).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC 7 Trophy ? HTC Titan</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Radar is not for anyone looking to upgrade from the Trophy or the Mozart. It?s for new WP7 users whom Mango may?ve had convinced but who?re still not confident enough to take a plunge with something as big as the HTC Titan.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And before you dismiss it as "so 2010", consider this. Last year, the first WP7 phones were rubbing shoulders with the flagships. They had the premium hardware but the first-gen software was taking away their competitive edge and putting potential customers off. The HTC Radar doesn?t have to worry about that. And we don?t mean the Mango update. Sure, it has addressed many of the platform?s deficiencies. More importantly though, the Radar is not what you?d call a high-end phone. It?s safe in the midrange, away from the industry?s hard-hitters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And there comes the concept of budget. A year ago, Windows Phone handsets were hard to afford. The minimum system requirements are still in place today but the same kind of hardware just no longer comes at premium prices. In the end, the Radar is a compromise between price and features. And one that had to be made, especially with the emergence of Nokia as a WP7 maker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s nearly unheard of for an HTC smartphone to match the price of a Nokia smartphone. That?s one other thing HTC need to take care of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia?s Lumia 710 is one of the Radar?s biggest rivals. In what?s virtually identical packages, the Lumia gets the upper hand with a ClearBlack display (LCD though, not AMOLED), faster 1.4GHz processor and free voice-guided navigation with Nokia Drive. And well, the Lumia and the Radar do cost nearly the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 710 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Omnia W (Focus Flash in the US) is Samsung?s second-gen WP7 offer in the midrange. The AMOLED screen and 1.4GHz processor are its key advantages over the Radar. We liked the subtle elegance of the Focus Flash in our recent review. It?s got a bit of metal on the chassis too, though not quite the solid unibody of the Radar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Omnia W I8350 ? Samsung Focus Flash I677 </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Radar is a mix-and-match job, which is kind of inevitable if you want a WP7 phone on a budget. It wears the clothes of the Android Desire line, and has the specs of the previous generation of Microsoft-powered smartphones by HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lines have been drawn. It?s now up to HTC to fill in the space between the flagship and the basic package, while keeping a keen eye on the competition. And yes, the HTC Radar is the basic package. But not a bad start for anyone willing to give the new Windows Phone Mango a try.</paragraph>
