			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Dual-SIM users generally fall in one of two categories - those on a tight budget who look to optimize spending by combining carrier plans, and frequent travelers, who don't want to carry two handsets all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Top-tier manufacturers have been trying to wrestle away the first group from white-box makers for a few years now, but only recently have they started to pay attention to the second one. Smartphones are only now starting to emerge that have a decent spec sheet to go with the extra SIM slot. Looking to avoid astronomical charges for data traffic in roaming does not necessarily mean that you want the cheapest device possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Enter the Samsung Galaxy S Duos S7562 - the smartphone that aims to deliver a solid smartphone experience, while juggling calls between a couple of SIMs. As usual we'll kickoff this review with a quick rundown of the smartphone's key strengths and most notable weaknesses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lists above might seem familiar and that's no accident. The Samsung Galaxy S Duos S7562 is merely a Galaxy Ace Plus with a larger screen, getting a lift from a pinch of Galaxy S III styling. There's no need to reinvent the wheel to create a mid-range device - Samsung are sticking to what's proven to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note (and more recently the Galaxy Note II) helped the world's biggest smartphone manufacturer discover and claim lots of new ground for itself in the high-end, and the company is undoubtedly trying to achieve something similar in the midrange with devices like the Galaxy S Duos. We'll know to what success by the time this review is complete, so let's waste no more time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unboxing and hardware inspection follow right after the break.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package as basic as it gets<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos comes in an averagely-sized retail package, whose contents fail to impress. This is probably the least accessorized of any European smartphones we have reviewed recently, not even having a headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All you get is a charger and a USB cable for tethering your Galaxy S Duos to your computer. The only good news is that the charger has its own wiring and doesn't need the USB cable, so you can keep one at home and the other at your office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you should keep in mind that retail package contents are market-dependent, so you may get a better deal than us.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy S Duos S7562 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Duos is fairly compact and quite pleasant to hold. At 121.5 x 63.1 x 10.5 mm it's barely bigger than an Ace 2 while featuring a bigger, 4" screen. The all-plastic device is very well put together and weighs the acceptable 120 g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In many ways, the Samsung Galaxy S Duos resembles the current Samsung flagship, the Galaxy S III. It's not as tall and not as thin of course, but the general aesthetics are undoubtedly influenced by the nature-inspired design of the S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Duos is a lot more subtle than its prominent sibling, most of which is down to the compact size. The good thing is it doesn't look like a cheap replica - far from it. In fact, the Galaxy S Duos is more sensible with the finish and does well without the high-gloss of the S III.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Looked from the front, the Samsung Galaxy S Duos looks like a high-end or at least an upper midrange device, with the thin bezel and white paintjob working well in its favor. Above the 4" WVGA (480 x 800 pixels) screen there's a VGA camera and a proximity sensor. There isn't an ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen is the familiar three-button combo - a hardware home button in the middle with two capacitive keys on either side for Menu and Back. The latter have a dedicated setting for the backlight duration but no haptic feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A silver frame runs all around the phone's front. The right side of the phone features the power button and the hot-swappable microSD card slot with a protective cap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side you'll find only the volume rocker and a lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5 mm headphone jack is placed at the top of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port and the mouthpiece are at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The primary 5 MP camera of the Samsung Galaxy S Duos comes with a single LED flash. There's also a loudspeaker grille at the back. The battery cover has a delicate rubbery feel to it for an excellent feel in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Remove the cover and you are greeted by a double-slotted SIM compartment, which is ready to accommodate the two regular SIM cards. Unlike the Galaxy Ace Duos, you don't need to remove the battery to reach the SIM cards, but changing SIMs still requires a reboot. Nokia's side-mounted hot-swappable SIM slot is by far a more comfortable solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a 1500 mAh battery under the hood, which according to Samsung should suffice for 7 h 25 min of talk time or 330 h of stand-by on 3G networks. Switch to 2G and you can get up to 13 h of talk time or 445 h of stand-by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our own battery tests show that the S Duos lasts about 8 and a half hours of talking on a 3G network. It's also good for 5 hours and 23 minutes of web browsing (over Wi-Fi) and 4 and half hours of watching videos. The endurance rating - how long you can go between charges if you do an hour each of calling, web browsing and watching videos every day - works out to 43 hours.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display on the Galaxy S Duos is a 4" TFT unit of 480 x 800 resolution, resulting in a density of approximately 233 pixels per inch. Those are some decent specs, considering the class of the smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors and contrast are good but the unit is too reflective (as seen by the sunlight legibility score). The S Duos doesn't offer an automatic brightness setting as it lacks an ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the Samsung Galaxy S Duos results from our display tests. To find more about the testing routines follow this link.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S Duos has a very pleasant feel in and. Nicely curved and very sensibly finished, the phone fits comfortably in the hand and easily slips in pockets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We like the Galaxy S Duos - it's well-built and good looking. Borrowing the premium design of the Galaxy S III was risky but it was done quite tastefully. The Duos is elegant without being overdone - we wouldn't be surprised if some people find it as attractive as the flagship Galaxy S III.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, on to software where ICS will hopefully help the Galaxy S Duos keep up the good impression.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: as seen on the Galaxy S III<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos comes with Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich and the latest TouchWiz UI, dubbed Nature UX. It's the same custom launcher that runs on the company's premium offerings like the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II but slightly trimmed down. Nevertheless, it gives Ice Cream Sandwich on the S Duos a pleasant look and feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did a quick demo of the user interface to give you a better idea what it looks like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the first place we noticed some differences: the ripples and water-drop sound are disabled. More importantly, the four customizable shortcuts at the bottom of the lockscreen are in place. In case of missed calls or incoming messages for example you can drag to unlock the device and directly launch the call log or the messaging app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock at the bottom of the homescreen now fits five custom shortcuts or folders. The rightmost one opens the app drawer as usual, but you can change the other four to any shortcut you like or even a folder full of shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can pinch to zoom out and easily manage homescreen panes - add, delete or just reorder them. You can have 7 panes at most, which are enough to fit plenty of content even if you use widgets that cover an entire pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area offers quick toggles for Wi-Fi, GPS, Silent mode, Screen rotation, Power saving. Only five toggles fit the screen at a time, but you can scroll them sideways to reveal more functions - Notifications (toggles icons in the top row of the screen), Mobile data, Bluetooth, Driving mode and Sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has a tab that lets you pull out widgets straight to the homescreen. Unlike stock Jelly Bean, you cannot move between tabs by swiping through the pages - you have to explicitly hit the widgets tab. Some will find this more logical (scrolling past the available apps to find yourself in the widgets takes some getting used to).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using pinch-to-zoom reveals an overview of the pages and lets you rearrange them, but you can't create new ones. Hitting the menu key reveals some more options, including hiding apps or enabling tap-to-uninstall mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer has three view modes - Customizable grid (where you can freely rearrange icons), Alphabetical grid (if you think you can find apps quicker when they're ordered alphabetically) and Alphabetical list (this one makes shortcuts easy to hit, but isn't very space efficient). You can also view just the downloaded apps by hitting the Downloaded apps icon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android Ice Cream Sandwich comes with various widgets and Samsung have added even more. Some widgets are resizable too - a feature we've previously seen in some custom UIs is now natively available in Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get several apps running, you can use the task switcher to go back and forth between them. It's an ICS-style vertical list with a screenshot and a name for each app. Swiping an app sideways removes it from the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a button at the bottom of the list to bring out Samsung's home-brewed task manager with a Remove all button. This is the quickest way to clear up both the list and some RAM.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos features the Qualcomm S1 SoC, which relies on a single-core Cortex-A5 processor, clocked at 1 GHz. Graphics are handled by the outdated Adreno 200 GPU and there's 768 MB of RAM on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is one of the slowest chipsets around, so we couldn't really see it acing any of our benchmark tests. BenchmarkPi stresses the CPU's math skills and the Galaxy S Duos scored 748ms in its best attempt, which is in line with our expectations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Duos Linpack score was also rather disappointing. The smartphone managed a score of just 30.3 - way worse than most of the other mid-rangers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider is a JavaScript benchmark - the good JavaScript engine of Android ICS stock browser helped the S Duos stay closer to the the more capable contenders out there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next benchmark is BrowserMark, which tells a similar story to SunSpider - the Galaxy S Duos is again off the pace, but not by much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Duos GPU showed its age in the NenaMark 2 test. The smartphone scored managed to achieve just over 20fps, which means that only games way lighter than the benchmark will be playable here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So the Galaxy S Duos is no race horse when it comes to synthetic benchmarks. It's designed to be power efficient and battery friendly so if you're in it for the most potent smartphone out there, this isn't it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Nature UX dressing on top of Android 4.0.4 looks great and the Galaxy S Duos does offer a fair amount of features. It's rare to see a dual-SIM droid having most of the bells and whistles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, there's no getting away from the fact that the device is at times sluggish to get around the Nature UX and load some heavier apps. A slightly speedier CPU (a NovaThor perhaps) would have probably been a better choice here as it would have provided a smoother ride around the UI, without rising the price too significantly.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook ticks all the right boxes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook of the Galaxy S Duos shares a lot of premium features with the Galaxy S III and that's on top of the dual-SIM capabilities. In addition to the wide range of features, the phonebook has practically unlimited storage capacity as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are options to filter contacts that have phone numbers, show/hide some of the groups you've created (including groups from social networks) and change the sorting (by first or last name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the phonebook has the Quick contacts feature Androids have been having since Eclair came around. It lets you tap the contact photo for a popup menu with shortcuts to call, text, or email. The TouchWiz-specific swiping gesture is here too - swipe a contact right to make a call and left to compose a message.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many info fields that you can assign to each contact, but it still remains perfectly organized. You have all types listed (numbers, email addresses, etc) and there's a plus sign on the right to add another item of that type. Pressing the minus sign under it deletes the unneeded field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the real flexibility of the phonebook becomes apparent when you sign in to your Facebook, LinkedIn or other Social network account. The phonebook will offer to automatically merge your contacts (you can do it manually too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Duos also comes with a built-in rejection list, allowing you to easily blacklist contacts without the need of third-party applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM calling and dialing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos has a dedicated SIM Manager to configure how calls and data are handled on both cards. As we said, SIM cards on the S Duos are not hot-swappable, so a reboot is always required when changing cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whenever you add a new SIM card and power the device on, an interface pops up allowing you to rename and even change the icon to easily identify different SIMs. This interface can be accessed at any time from the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos remembers the settings for any SIM you customize, which is great if you've got more than two SIM cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Duos allows for both SIM cards to be active simultaneously, meaning that you can receive a call on one SIM even while you are on a call with the other. What happens is that calls from your other SIM are forwarded to your currently active SIM's network, which you can put on hold to answer (this might incur additional network charges). You can put the two calls on and off hold as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can toggle the Dual SIM Always On option on or off for either SIM card. Effectively, this enables call waiting and call forwarding so you can switch each SIM card on and off individually (which can help save battery).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also pick which SIM is to be used for mobile data - only one can be used at a time. Another option is whether or not the phone should be able to receive calls on the other SIM while using mobile data on one SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is involved in SIM management too. Underneath the quick system toggles, there are big buttons labeled SIM 1 and SIM 2, for quick switching between cards before dialing a number. During a call, the active SIM gets displayed at the top of the call interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos had no issues with reception even in areas with poor coverage. Sound in the earpiece was crisp and reasonably loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart Dialing is available and whenever you tap a digit and both contact numbers and names containing it are displayed. The catch is that name searching works with only the initial letter. On the other hand, number searching looks up recent calls too. If more than one contact is found, a button with a number and an arrow will display the rest of the matches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the proximity sensor onboard, the S Duos turns its screen off once you lift it up and turns it back on when you finish a call. The available options during a call include using the keypad, muting the call, or adding another call to the conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log is the tab next to the dial pad. It displays all the dialed, received and missed calls in one list. A tiny icon identifies the SIM that made or received the call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos has one of the quietest loudspeakers we've tested, scoring Below Average in our traditional loudspeaker test. Here's how it stacks up against the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging interface is quite straightforward: there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping on a message header will do exactly the same as in the phonebook - a left swipe starts a new message, while swiping to the right will start a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's application-specific search that lets you quickly locate a message among all your stored SMS and MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add multimedia content to the message, it automatically turns into an MMS. You can either quickly add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or compose an MMS using all the available features (like multiple slides, slide timing, layout, etc.). The multiple slides are all shown inside the compose box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allows multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. Multiple Gmail accounts are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can support multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It offers a combined inbox option, which color-codes emails from different accounts for easier sorting and viewing. Conversation layout is also available - it groups related emails into single entries with a number in parenthesis showing the number of emails grouped. A tap on that entry expands it to show a list of the individual messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles Instant Messaging. The G-Talk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as text entry goes, you have the standard Samsung keyboard at your disposal, as well as XT9. Both are fairly comfortable, although the keys might feel a little cramped in portrait. The landscape keyboard should be good enough. There's handwriting recognition and Swype support as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery and file browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos comes with the default ICS Gallery. It opens up in Albums view, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, photos are sorted by Location, Time, Person (photos with tagged faces) and Group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing a single photo, you'll find several sharing shortcuts and a delete button above the photo, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery also supports highly customizable slideshows with several effects to choose from, customizable music and speed. You can also highlight specific images to be included in the slideshow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app hasn't changed really - it is an efficient and simple to use file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, even send multiple files to another phone. My files will only browse the memory card and the large internal storage (it can't access the system drive).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz music player goes after Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos uses an updated version of the TouchWiz music player. Samsung has enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing SoundAlive technology, which features 7.1 channel virtualization. Samsung uses SoundAlive in some of their MP3 and Android-powered media players.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music is sorted into various categories, but the most interesting one is called Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony Ericsson phones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From here, you can highlight an area of the square and the phone will automatically build a playlist of songs that matches your selection. For example, if you highlight the upper part of the square the selected songs will be exciting and if your selection is centered around the lower right corner, the selected songs will be calm and joyful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can swipe the album art left and right to move between songs. You can also put the phone face down to mute the sound or place your palm over the screen to pause playback.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung have put a lite version of the video player from its flagship Galaxy S III onto the Galaxy S Duos. As a result, the device has easily one of the best video players around and is packed with various options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view, unlike the Galaxy S III, doesn't have the live thumbnails, as the S Duos lacks the brute quad-core power needed to support them. Instead, Samsung has replaced them with statics thumbnails, which do the job just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. The same SoundAlive audio-enhancing technology is available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you squeeze out the best viewing experience from the large, high-res screen. You can adjust video brightness, color tone and enable outdoor visibility too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player had absolutely no trouble with any of the files we threw at it - starting with .WMV, through .AVI (DivX and XviD) and .MP4 to .MKV (H.264). The latter had some problems playing files with HD and full HD resolutions, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos also made a good impression when it offered a list of subtitles and let us pick. Most players look for a file with the exact same name as the video file (save for the extension), which means quite often you have to rename the subtitle file to match the video file just so that the player will show you subtitles.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos is equipped with an FM radio with RDS too. The interface is simple - there's a tuning dial and you can save as many as 8 stations as favorites. You can also listen on the loudspeaker, but the headset is still needed as it acts as the antenna. You can record radio broadcasts as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos did decently well in our audio quality test. It's by far not the most talented musician around but, it should still please everyone, but the most demanding audiophiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Duos got some pretty good scores in the active external amplifier part of our test. The only two weak points of its performance were the cut-off extreme bass frequencies and the slightly higher than average intermodulation distortion. The rest of the readings were quite good, while the volume levels were about average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is relatively little degradation when headphones come into play. The stereo crosstalk spikes and the intermodulation distortion rises a bit, but that's about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 5MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos comes with a 5MP camera that can shoot photos at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is virtually the same as on the Galaxy S III, with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, a virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut (which is a thumbnail of the last photo taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left you get several controls and the good news is that you can pick any four shortcuts to put there - you can easily have all frequently used features just a tap away. The fifth shortcut always points to Settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as features go, you get goodies like geotagging, smile detection, panorama mode, Share shot, scenes and effects. There's no touch focus, burst mode or HDR, but we can't expect the S Duos to match the S III in terms of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual images are good with pleasing colors and good dynamic range. Photos are a bit grainy, but there's no color noise, and there's a decent amount of fine detail. Overall, for its price range, the Galaxy S Duos is a pretty good 5MP shooter.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos has synthetic resolution that's virtually identical to that of the Ace Duos, but there's a noticeable pink spot. It exhibits a lot less noise reduction and oversharpening than the HTC Desire V (that's even more noticeable in the second chart), which is a win. Artificial lighting is handled well by good white balance.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA video camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S Duos captures video in VGA resolution at around the 30 fps mark. The bitrate of the videos hovers around 3300 Kbps, of which around 130 Kbps are for the audio (mono, 38kHz).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is almost the same as the still camera's - you get the same customizable panel on the left for up to five shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is good enough, though the resolution is nothing to write home about and the low bitrate results in visible loss of fine detail. Still, it would do in a pinch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download an untouched VGA@30fps video sample if you want to have a look at the video quality.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung-themed ICS browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos has the ICS version of the Android browser, but you can install Chrome if you prefer. Note that the default browser isn't quite the same as the stock Android browser - Samsung have tweaked the interface to match the rest of TouchWiz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, find on page and so on. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum to open up the tabs view. Handy options let you request a desktop site or print a web page (works only on Samsung printers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Web browser comes with Incognito mode, which enables you to surf the web without the browser keeping track of your history or storing cookies. You can also switch to a more minimalist UI, called Quick controls, which currently is in a Lab stage. It disables most of the browser's user interface and gives you a quick five-button layout to access the basics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flash is not available out of the box and it failed to work even after we installed it. YouTube does support HTML5 videos, but they strain the chipset and the interface becomes sluggish.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos comes with the Polaris Office Viewer that can handle Word, Excel and PowerPoint files (2003 and 2007 files), as well as PDFs. It cannot edit those files, you'll need a paid app from the Play Store for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead of the native Android calendar, the S Duos comes with Samsung's S Note. It supports multiple online calendars, including Google Calendar, Samsung's own solution, Facebook and Exchange ActiveSync. Calendars can easily be hidden and revealed again, so don't worry about clutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has six different types of view: Year, Month, Week, Day, List (a.k.a. Agenda) and Tasks. Adding a new event is quick and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list view shows all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It's a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The My Files app is a simple to use but efficient file manager. It can move, copy, lock and rename files in bulk, and even send multiple files via Bluetooth. My Files will only browse the memory card (it can't access the internal drive).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized and advanced calculator functions are available by turning the phone horizontally. You can also adjust the font size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos' Clock application combines an alarm clock (you can set multiple alarms with individual repeat times), a world clock, a stopwatch and timer, plus a desk clock mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Memo app is pretty self-explanatory - it lets you create text memos, which you can later sync with Google Docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a Voice recorder, which has a cool sound level meter while you're recording. You can limit the recording to fit an MMS or you can just leave it unlimited.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS, Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S Duos managed to get a GPS lock in just under a minute without A-GPS. A-GPS can speed up the lock (but it involves data traffic). Cell-ID and Wi-Fi positioning are also available if all you need is a rough location, but they need a data connection too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always-cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection. Note that voice-guided navigation is not available in all countries.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to really minimize data usage, you can cache whole areas of the map, it doesn't use up too much internal storage (e.g. all of London is around 30MB).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store and Samsung Apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play app store features several tabs that sort apps in categories: Top Paid, Top Free, Top Grossing, Top New Paid, Top New Free and Trending (the ones with growing popularity). Other interesting sections are Recommended for You, Staff Picks and Editor's Choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each app has several screenshots and some even have videos that show the app in action. Downloads are easy and before you agree to download an app, the Store will show you what features the app requires access to (e.g. Internet connectivity, access to the file system, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Apps works in much the same way; there's a featured interface which shows the more popular app highlights, as well as pages which display the newest and most downloaded applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the option to browse through app categories, and installing an app is done exactly the same way as in the Play Store.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The second SIM slot adds an extra dimension to the Samsung Galaxy S Duos, which will only be relevant to a limited set of users, and that's what makes it a lot harder to properly judge. If you look at it as a regular smartphone, it has neither the specs nor the real-life performance the price tag implies. Dual-cores can actually be had for less, so the Galaxy S Duos will always be struggling to keep up in that race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, any smartphone will have a hard time competing with one hand tied behind the back. And that's the important point here - you should only consider the Samsung Galaxy S Duos if the dual-SIM functionality is essential for you and not just a nice extra that you can probably live without.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, the Galaxy S Duos is easily among the best dual-SIM smartphone on the global market right now. Admittedly, the bar is not set too high as tier-one manufacturers are only now starting to pay proper attention to the market segment, but even so, Samsung deserve some credit what they did.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problem for the Koreans is that they are not alone at the top. The HTC Desire V matches the Galaxy S Duos specs sheet in everything, but the amount of RAM and costs about the same. When things are so close though even something as small can make a huge difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't plan on installing a 3rd party launcher, you should also consider the UI differences here - TouchWiz does have an edge over Sense UI in terms of functionality, but the cleaner look of the HTC launcher wins in terms of aesthetics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire V</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have no problem going a bit further down the brand pecking order, you should definitely consider the Acer Liquid Gallant Duo. Packing a 4.3" screen of qHD resolution and a more powerful chipset than the Galaxy S Duos and Desire V, this is arguably the best spec'd dual-SIM droid currently on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Acer doesn't have the experience of the two big players in the software development department, but the Liquid Gallant Duo more than makes up for that with its lower price tag. However, finding a unit in your local market might turn out to be a problem, as the Liquid Gallant Duo isn't nearly as widely available as its two competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer Liquid Gallant Duo</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-SIM market is obviously expanding to cover new ground and Samsung is not going to let itself fall behind. Its offering is, as in most other segments of the smartphone market, at the forefront of the assault. This time however the Galaxy S Duos has been quite evenly matched by the competition so it will be looking at the brand recognition to boost its market performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A quick look at the smartphone's specs page and its daily interest rating will tell you that this might turn out to be a far more potent weapon than you may've thought.</paragraph>
