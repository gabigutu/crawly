			<paragraph>The LG KU990 Viewty is a true powerhouse packing a mass of high-tech goodies under its hood: the impressive 3" touchscreen display with 240 x 400 pixels resolution, the HSDPA 3.6 Mbps capability, the stereo Bluetooth and the highly intriguing 5 megapixel camera with autofocus, which is also capable of capturing video at 120 fps. Feature-packed and exquisite, the LG KU990 looks set on the fast track to success and we were more than happy to get our hands on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 Viewty was only recently announced but it somehow fails to cause the same stir in the mobile community as the 5-megapixel Sony Ericsson K850 or the Samsung G600. Yet, as we managed to find out, it's a highly sophisticated device, that's quick to impress and certainly deserves attention.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KU990 Viewty is not the first 5 megapixel cameraphone by LG. There are a number of reasons why their first attempt - the LG KG920 failed to gain noteworthy market share - the high price, the controversial swiveling design, and the slow camera interface, just to mention a few.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Back to our game<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 Viewty measures 103.5 x 54.4 x 14.8 mm, which makes it about the size of iPhone, Sony Ericsson P1 or even HTC Touch. It weighs 112 g, which is not really much considering its performance characteristics. Designwise, it's almost certain that people would inevitably compare it to the Prada phone by LG. They share the same form factor, large screen and Flash UI, but are still totally different and this time Prada has no involvement in the project.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the handset features only three hardware keys - the green and red Send/End keys and the correction C key, which is used as either backspace or for going one level up in the interface menu. In the top right corner, the secondary VGA camera for video calls can be found. The left side of the Viewty hosts the charger/headset/data cable universal port (much like the ones used by Samsung). It's ingeniously hidden under a sliding cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom and top parts of the headset host no controls. The only point of interest at the bottom is the microphone pinhole, while the top offers the back cover release button and the stylish hand or neck strap eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the KU990 is far more interesting in terms of controls, since it incorporates the camera shutter key, the hardware keylock button, which is otherwise used to take pictures with image stabilization, and - finally a hardware slider key, that changes camera modes between still camera, video camera and image gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backside of the LG KU990 stunningly resembles the looks of a true digital camera. The 5 megapixel camera lens with Schneider-Kreuznach optics has a hardware jog wheel, that controls the digital zoom. It can also be used for setting the exposure compensation and brightness, as well as for zooming on pictures in the gallery, on office documents and web pages, as well as for controlling the volume. Around the camera lens, which has no protective cover of any sort, you will find the strobe flash, the focus assist light and the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the 1000mAh Li-Ion battery. The SIM card slot and the microSD memory card slot are accessible only after you've removed it. As to battery life, there are no official figures but our test revealed that under heavy duty usage, the handset will last about 2-2.5 days with a single charge. The relatively good news is that DivX playback doesn't exert any extra strain on the battery. For example, the battery lasted enough to allow us to use the phone moderately for one full day and watch a 2-hour DivX movie later on in the evening, before it went completely flat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 is really easy to handle and the touch-centric form factor is of no hindrance to usability. It feels nice and comfortable to hold. Speaking of touch though, it has got to be noted that the KU990 Viewty has a different touch-sensitive display than the LG Prada phone. While the Prada screen only accepted commands when touched with a bare finger or through a thin cloth, here you can use your fingers, the enclosed stylus, a pen, or even your doorkeys (certainly not advisable!). The display deals well under bright sunlight, though no display by whatever manufacturer has so far managed to beat Nokia in this respect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 Viewty comes with an original stylus dongle, that doesn't plug anywhere into the handset. It is attached to the handstrap eyelet instead. It's quite innovative and looks great, but we're not convinced that it's that convenient after all, to have your stylus dangle alongside the handset in everyday use.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 deals great with making phone calls, as you have all the rights to expect. When it comes to loudspeaker volume, it was a nice surprise that it's the loudest handset we've tested recently in our office.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This will be the first review where we publish the results of our latest sound level test setup. We are using a digital noise meter to measure the highest sound levels, that our test handsets manage to reach. All measurements are made with the device's loudspeaker physically facing the noise meter at a distance of 1 m. There are three types of test sounds that we use - a selected ringtone (sounds like an old telephone ringing), pink noise (which for our purposes stands for the loudest levels of a music track) and - finally - human speech (which you would normally hear when using the handset speakerphone during a call). The maximum values for each type of sound are recorded in three consecutive tests and the highest one is taken for our records. When comparing results, bear in mind that we are dealing with a logarithmic scale here, which practically means that even a slightly higher readings may mean a significant audible difference in reality. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the LG KU990 Viewty stacks alongside some of the other handsets we've tested recently. More info on our test here.</paragraph>

		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flashy user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of LG KU990 is based on Flash technology, much like the one in LG Prada. The KU990 is still not a smartphone or anything, but it has one huge difference in comparison to the Prada phone. It's that now we have ourselves a nifty little task manager, that works great and all open applications such as the phonebook, new message window, calendar, calculator, etc., are listed once you've launched them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the standby screen there is info about the battery status, current profile and signal strength. The task manager icon is there too - right in the corner. A tap on the profiles icon brings out a popup with the available profiles. The main screen can visualize a floating clock as the Prada phone, but now you can opt for adding a calendar next to it, or even make them both disappear. A single tap on the clock brings out the Alarms flag which allows you to setup an alarm straight from the standby screen - comfortable enough, we would say. You can even set two time zones to display simultaneously on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of the screen there is a navigation bar with shortcuts. Unfortunately, the available four shortcuts are not user configurable. The first shortcut takes you to the main menu, the second opens the Dial pad for you to type in a number, the third opens the messages submenu and the last one opens the Contacts list - no changes here as compared to the Prada phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned, the four shortcuts in the bottom of the screen are not user-configurable, so a nice upgrade over the Prada phone is the new shortcuts grid that overlays the Home screen once you tap on the arrows you might have noticed on the previous Calendar screenshot. The shortcuts grid doesn't simply appear on the screen but slides in stylishly. Tap the right arrows and it goes away, and you are again left alone with the clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next to the small icon of the task manager in top right corner, you will see an icon of the currently active ringing profile. A press on it invokes the Profile menu, which offers extensive setup options for the available profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface of KU990 retains the same menu system as the Prada phone - simple, yet impressively sophisticated. Ergonomics and user-friendliness are at their heights. LG have made a really nice job designing the user interface system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at our video showing the home screen and the main menu:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Home screen &amp; main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu consists of four submenus - they are displayed in a column on the right-hand side of the screen. They don't have names but the first one contains elements related to making calls and sending messages. The second one is the entertainment package, which houses the multimedia files, the camera, the FM radio, the games, the music player, the web browser, and two streaming video applications. The third submenu includes organizer applications such as the Calendar, the Calculator, the Unit converter, etc. And finally, the fourth item handles all the settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the user interface comes in the black and white theme, well-known from the LG Prada phone. There are two other UI themes that come in full color, with beautiful icons. One of them offers a fish swimming on your display (the Prada had that, too). You can change the wallpaper on the welcome screen if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An absolute must-have for every fully touch-based handset and a feature we missed in the Prada phone is some sort of feedback when the screen is pressed - something besides the touch tone and the touch animation. LG have taken care of it for us and the KU990 is haptics-enabled, which means that every press is accompanied by a gentle vibration, that let's you know your press has been accepted. Settings for it include a choice of three types of vibration plus 7 levels of vibration strength.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook has seen some changes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Contacts list offers much the same function as any ordinary phonebook. The contacts capacity is 500 contacts (which is only half the count the Prada phone had). The phonebook allows storing extensive information on you contacts. You can organize your contacts into caller groups, and you can also assign them a picture and a ringtone. The phonebook has received a nice upgrade when it comes to filtering and searching your contacts. A new column which was missing in the Prada has now appeared on the left and you can use the alphabetic shortcuts to find contact based on the first letter of their names (kind of reminds of iPhone, doesn't it?). The system used in the Prada phone for filtering and searching your contacts is also an option here - a keypad is available all the time while you scroll through your contacts. Search is performed by gradual typing of the contact's name. It's handy for specific searches but only two contacts are visible at a time with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see the new phonebook in action in our special video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing the phonebook</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Prada phone, you can set the phonebook to display phone and SIM contacts separately.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Texting gets easier<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports the sending and receiving of SMS, MMS and email messages. The Prada had separate message editors, while with the KU990 turning an SMS into MMS is simpler. You just need to click on the paper-clip (attachment) icon you see on the screenshots. The actual typing of the messages without a hardware keypad is much easier now that LG have added haptics (slight vibrations) to provide feedback on every key press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A great add-on to the messaging department is the handwriting recognition. You can use the stylus to input text or you can even edit text that has already been typed. Unfortunately, the handwriting recognition doesn't score as high as the one seen in Windows Mobile PocketPC. There are several text input methods - keypad, QWERTY keyboard, handwriting on the screen, handwriting in box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>See the QWERTY keyboard in action in our video:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the QWERTY keyboard</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you choose the QWERTY keyboard as an input method, the interface automatically turns in to landscape mode. If you think about it - it does resemble the iPhone keyboard, doesn't it? Generally speaking, we liked the QWERTY keyboard and we managed to get the hang of it really quickly. Unfortunately, the QWERTY keyboard input which we liked best is not available throughout the whole interface where text needs to be entered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to emails, the LG KU990 deals with them with no hassle whatsoever. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported. The maximum attachment size for incoming mail is 400KB. You can set the handset to auto retrieve your new emails at a preset interval of time with a separate option for that when you are in roaming. Unfortunately, we couldn't set it up to work with our test Gmail account, so we guess that the email client of the KU990 doesn't have support for SSL encryption.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia comes to mind<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 comes with a good 100MB of internal memory (The Prada phone had only 16MB) and a microSD memory card slot. It's really mind-boggling why the memory card slot is not available to the user without removing the battery as this represents a serious hit on user-friendliness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager appears as a My stuff item in the menu. It includes separate factory-preset folders for different multimedia content. You can copy or move files to the external memory or send them via Bluetooth, and for all of those options you can rely on multiple selection. However, we did notice a huge lag in folder browsing, once the memory card started to fill up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Viewty file browser has a quick fix for your underexposed images (the dark ones taken in low light conditions). It's called Smart Light and applying it to your images produces surprisingly good results - otherwise unusable photos turn into nicely looking snaps with preserved colors and natural brightness with no extra noise added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 also has office document viewer functionality thanks to the Picsel viewer. As we managed to confirm, the viewer supports MS Word documents, MS Excel files and PDF files. Unlike the Prada phone, scrolling and zooming on the documents is really fast. In fact, we've never seen the Picsel viewer work that fast. It's only on PDF files that you notice certain lags. You can even view your documents in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main functionality of the image gallery remains the same as the one of the Prada phone, only browsing thumbnails is now faster and zooming on pictures is available. Images can be viewed both as thumbnails and as a list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KU990 offers an upgraded MP3 player, as compared to the one in Prada. When it comes to track filtering, the Prada phone didn't have any options at all. The LG KU990 Viewty can filter tracks as any other modern music player - by artist, album, genre, playlist, recently played and several more. The handset itself has a Flight mode, which really makes it an adequate solution as a portable music player. On the other hand, there are still no equalizer settings for you to use to enhance the player sound. A certain drawback of the music player is that when you change the interface theme to some of the other available ones, the player stays black and ruins the uniform silvery look. The Prada phone had a solution for that - the player had its own black and white skin. That option is nowhere to be found here. Naturally, the music player runs in the background without any problem. The same goes for the FM radio, too. It also has RDS support but unfortunately sound cannot be turned over to the external loudspeaker. The radio stores up to 12 stations - way too little if you ask us. The KU990 is also equipped with a flash player which easily plays .swf files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player of the LG KU990 is much like the one seen in the Prada phone - it is really nice and you can watch videos in fullscreen landscape mode, with or without semi-transparent overlay of player controls. You can also opt for both normal and widescreen aspect ratio. The greatest improvement in the video department is that the Viewty is now capable of playing DivX 5 videos (files with up to VGA resolution at 30 fps). Most of the videos that we tried played smoothly and offered the same image quality as seen on PC. There were few exceptions but we couldn't find out where the difference came from. Anyway, having such a portable device play DivX videos is another great step (remember Samsung F500!) in the right direction for the mobile community.  </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it was first announced, the KU990 was supposed to have direct YouTube integration, but later on in the development process the feature was cancelled since most of the carriers didn't want their customers to have that feature. As LG stated the feature will be available only on Viewty units made for T-Mobile and Hutchinson.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 29 Nov: After we received a final retail unit, we are now able to confirm that the LG KU990 Viewty comes with YouTube integration. You can upload your video files to YouTube - directly from your file manager. All you need to do is select the video to upload, tag it, and finally input your YouTube account details - it's really that easy. We are glad that the LG team has decided to put the feature on-board.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Until recently, sound quality used to be a subjective matter in our reviews. Realizing that mobile phones are evermore used as portable music players, subjective just won't do any more. That is why we at GSMArena will be including a new audio test in our reviewing routine to give you a more objective view of how the music players in all those handsets perform. Soon we will publish a separate article to describe our analysis procedures and serve as a reference point for all the handsets we've had a chance to analyze. For now, we suffice to say that all the sound tests are done on M-Audio Fast Track Pro external audio interface and RightMark Audio Analyzer 6.0.5 software with special sound samples. This gives us the opportunity to create a controlled environment, which should produce accurate and comparable results throughout all the units tested. So here are the results of the LG KU990 Viewty and its graph compared to Apple iPod 5th generation (better) and Nokia 7500 Prism (worse). Since we still don't have a large database with sound analysis results, we can only say that the LG KU990 performs much like the Sony Ericsson K770 (a review is coming really soon).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio quality test results</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frequency response   LG KU990 Viewty vs. Nokia 7500 Prism ? LG KU990 Viewty vs. Apple iPod 5G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking the peek in the separate graphs (pun intended!), the KU990 head-to-head with Apple iPod and Nokia 5700 makes us guess that LG has put some low frequency filter which suppresses the low frequencies (below 100Hz). Doing that with an external loudspeaker might be justified, but remember that we are testing the sound output from the headphones jack here. Normal headphones would have been able to play those sounds if it wasn't for this filter, so there goes a poor mark to LG</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>USB portable drive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone features high-speed USB Mass Storage support and the LG USB cable comes along in the retail box. When connected to a PC, the Prada phone made the phone memory and the memory card both appear in the Windows Explorer as removable drives with no special drivers needed. With the KU990 you only have the memory card appearing, and the internal memory is not accessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as network connectivity is concerned, the phone features tri-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE plus HSDPA 3.6 Mbps. There is also Bluetooth 1.2 with A2DP stereo support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Tabbed web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 enjoys a wonderful web browser with rich options. It does manage to put the screen real estate to its advantage and you can browse web pages with or without the controls visible. Turning the screen to landscape makes browsing even more enjoyable. There is even a mini-map to help you find your way around spacious web pages. And if all that is not enough, it supports tabbed browsing allowing you to forget about linear browsing and open your links of interest in separate tabs that you can close independently later on. The only drawback we found with it is that it scrolls somewhat slowly (nothing still beats the Symbian OS 9.1 3rd web browser).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Time management and applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward, it offers a monthly and a weekly view and you can navigate the dates with your finger. A large orange square denotes the current date. When you touch on a date, a pop-up appears so you can see what's under your finger. Unlike the Prada phone, you can choose which day should be the first day of the week by default. You can also choose the default view - weekly or monthly. Adding an event is made really simple. You can have up to 100 calendar events. There's a separate Tasks application and it can also store up to 100 tasks. There is also a Memos feature that allows storing some notes. Unfortunately, you can store as little as 5 of them. The Alarm clock has 5 available alarm slots (the Prada had only one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 also has a Calculator, a Unit converter and a World Time application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Time application is among the few things in the LG KU990 Viewty that have been downgraded from the Prada phone. The application in the Prada phone was among the most atractive we've come across and we saw the same one used in LG KE970 Shine. But the World Time application in the KU990 is nowhere near that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 29 Nov: After we received a final retail unit, we found that the LG Viewty comes with a preinstalled Google package. The package includes a shortcut to Google search, a shortcut to Gmail, a shortcut to Blogger, a shortcut to YouTube mobile web version and finally, Google Maps for Mobile application. All shortcuts are loaded in the web browser, the GMaps is the only real application that comes with phone. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really liked the Muvee Studio application - you can feed it in with photos that've taken, for example, and it will create a MP4 movie clip out ouf them. The created movies vary by the style you choose for them. They change the background music, the transitions, the color effects and the speed of the slideshow. The resulting video clips resemble the slideshows generated by Sony Ericsson K850, however here you can share them with friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video created with several of our photos. You can also look at the screenshots of the process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 phone has support for Java MDIP 2.0, so you can install third party Java applications to suit your needs. We tried installing the Opera mini browser and it worked like a charm.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Shooting stars<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The only game that KU990 Viewty had was the LG Space Commando game. It offers rich 3D graphics for a mobile phone and somehow made us think that the handset had a hardware video accelerator like the Nokia N95. This shooter game is amusing and offers 3 gaming modes - piloting a spaceship, first-person shooting on human enemies and first-person shooting on aliens sneaking up on you, crawling on the walls, etc. Trying the game out was a fun pastime - the spaceship/character is controlled by the game and all you are left with is shooting (tapping on the screen in the KU990 case).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice innovation with the Java games/applications, as compared to the Prada phone, is the large virtual keys in the bottom of the screen. They take some of the screen real estate but they have two positive effects. First, it allows the games/applications to work in the more standard (QVGA) resolution and, secondly, potential problems with the touch-sensitive navigation in any of the new games you'll be trying are dealt with by having additional controls at your disposal.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>One impressive camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first 5 megapixel cameraphone by LG, the KG920, failed to impress us with its camera performance. Now that we have our hands on KU990 Viewty, we are quite amazed from the very start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera uses almost the whole display as a viewfinder in standard ratio, while in fullscreen it fascinates even more. It takes pictures at a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four hardware keys, that command the camera - the first one is a slider on the righthand side, that sets the camera mode: photo, video, and gallery - just as on a regular digicam (mind you, Sony Ericsson K850 has the same switch on its side). The gallery application launched by this switch is really wonderful - all your images and videos are shown as a shuffled deck of pictures. A touch on any of the images brings it to the front; a second touch on the image corner displays image info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>

</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG KU990 gallery in action</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the camera now? The second key, that has anything to do with the camera is the mechanical jog wheel on the back. It is used for zooming in and out (digitally, of course). The shutter key on the right side is the third dedicated key. The fourth, and last one of them, is the lock/unlock key, which also starts the digital image stabilization mode of the camera. Sounds exciting, but it isn't that much of a deal. It zooms in a bit and uses the spare pixels to compensate for the camera shake. We didn't see much use in it, as it simply cannot compete with mechanical optical stabilization used even in low-end digital cameras.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look at the samples:    Image stabilization on and off at ISO100: not really impressive</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is equipped with a strobe flash, which ranks somewhere between a regular LED and the xenon flash, used in the Sony Ericsson K800 and the like. Beside the flash, there is also a focus assist beam as the one seen in a regular camera. It does a great job to only fail in macro shots. There it doesn't really help the autofocus, since it doesn't light up the subject in the center but a tad to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface has extensive settings. You can use several preset scene modes (landscape, beach, party, portrait, night, sport, high sensitive), plus there are some special shooting modes (continuous shot, panorama and frames). The Continuous shot mode resembles much the BestPic mode seen in Sony Ericsson Cyber-shot handsets, while the Panorama mode makes panorama images out of several consequent shots - many Sony Ericsson mobiles have that mode, but the LG makes higher resolution images (each individual shot is made with a 1-megapixel resolution, while with Sony Ericsson each shot is made at 640x480 pixels). The Sony Ericsson handsets also make panorama images out of only three consecutive shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Take a look at our sample:   The KU990 is great at Panorama images and certainly better than its 5 megapixel competitors</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KU990 is also equipped with a timer and you can use manual focus to capture those hard-to-get situations. The white balance is a standard setting in cameraphones but the Viewty has also a Color tone option, that you can use to make the colors of your pictures more vivid (besides black and white, sepia, and negative). You can also manually adjust the ISO (100-800). Unfortunately, in our unit the shutter sound couldn't be turned off. Allegedly, the camera should have also come with a face recognition feature, but as we managed to find out the feature was removed in the pre-production phase.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had our taste of two pre-production versions of the LG KU990 Viewty - that is why some of the images lack EXIF information. Other than that, the images are really likeable. Their dynamic range is high, so the highlights are not easily clipped. The high-res detail is all there and the noise is kept under control. There aren't any traces of chromatic aberrations, which speaks highly of the Scheider-Kreuznach optics used. In some situations, they easily beat the Sony Ericsson K850, which we reviewed recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of performance and speed, the LG KU990 also managed to please us. The shot-to-shot time at full 5 megapixel resolution is around 4 seconds - the same as with Sony Ericsson K850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We decided to downsample several of our shots, since probably most of you will end up using resized versions of the original photos, plus its somewhat harder to judge picture quality when you look at a picture online at 100%. The LG KU990 photos look really great downsampled at 1024 x 768 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has some downsides, of course. The noise levels are sometimes high in the shadows and in some cases we observed strange color dithering instances. We do however expect this to be fixed in the final retail version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Video is on par, too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KU990 is meant to be a revolution with its video recording capabilities. All the video recordings are stored in AVI file format with DivX 5.0 encoding. This ensures good balance between file size and quality and is remarkable amongst cameraphones. The camcoder supports capturing video in VGA resolution at 30 fps (the "DVD-like quality" as advertised by Nokia), but that's not all. At QVGA resolution the framerate can soar up to 120 fps!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we first heard that the newly announced Viewty will be able to shoot video at 120 fps we thought it was some kind of a mistake. After all, most digital cameras and camcorders nowadays will only go up to 60 fps. As it turned out, the 120fps were for real. Why should we need such speed, you may ask, when the good old 24 frames is what gets people crowding the movie theaters. Well, the 120 fps mode is meant for slow motion movies. LG calls the mode QVGA QVS and while the capture occurs at 120 fps, the resulting AVI file is stored at 15 fps slowing down the recorded action 8 times.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Doing the math, it turns out that these 120 fps at QVGA are not that demanding on the processing power. The amount of pixels processed per second is exactly the same as with VGA 30 fps movies. As you may see from our samples, a 120 fps video recorder can be real fun and it's strange that no other manufacturer (digicams included) has implemented it so far.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>When shooting at 120 fps a lot of light is needed. It's easy to understand, since the shutter speed for each separate frame should be no slower than 1/120 sec, even if we don't count the added time for processing. Keeping the shutter speed as fast as 1/120 sec indoors, for example, can be done only with significant ISO boost, which of course will result in worse quality. So, to summarize, good-quality slow motion movies will be possible only with a lot of light and this is not the device's fault.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at our 120 fps samples. We've used VirtualDub to adjust the playing speed of the 30, 60 and 120 fps samples, the 15 fps version is the original one produced by the KU990.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It also comes in VGA flavor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our guess is that when the novelty of the new 120 fps mode fades out, the users will mainly use the VGA video capture at 30 fps. The DivX compression LG KU990 uses ensures that the video files don't need a lot of memory space. Our calculations show that this mode consumes only 300KB per second or, to put it simply, you can fit 1 hour of video on a 1GB memory card at the highest quality setting. Besides VGA resolution videos, the LG KU990 is also capable of recording movies in a 640x384 resolution with a 16:9 aspect ratio.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>All that said, the camera does have its drawbacks. There is no lens cover, using the jog wheel easily puts a finger on the lens and, finally, there is no macro mode when recording movies. In video mode KU990 behaves just like a fixed focus camera. A macro switch would have been welcome. This could've been handy when shooting slow motion movies of insects for example.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While some manufacturers tend to mass-produce handsets over the same interface and platform, LG have decided to do it their own way. We see improvements in interface with every new handset they release - fixing usability issues and making the user experience more enjoyable. It really shows they take into account user feedback in the mobile community, and are constantly developing their product line, both in terms of design and features. We've seen proof of that in all of their devices, ever since the creative LG Chocolate came to life. The LG KU990 Viewty stays on the same path.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Complete with high-tech features, the LG KU990 managed to impress us even at its pre-release stage. To say the least, the Viewty holds a lot of promise. It's a well-balanced product, in which style is not eclipsed by the massive functionality. We believe it's got what it takes to aim for a sweeping success.</paragraph>
