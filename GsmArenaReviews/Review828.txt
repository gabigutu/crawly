			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another season, another flagship, another mini in tow. Guess we all know the drill but HTC had quite a few decisions to make. To begin with, they went for a bigger screen, placing the mini 2 right between the original and last season's flagship. The UltraPixel camera was dropped for a regular 13MP unit, which looks like a good move judging by our recent experience with the Desire 816.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact, the latest mini is quite close to last year's flagship - which more than makes sense - but we bet the first thing on HTC's mind was closing the gap on Sony's Xperia Z1 compact. However, at a price that's uncomfortably close to ?500, this mini is asking a lot. Let's just say, a better chipset would have been nice at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, with KitKat right out of the box, the Snapdragon 400 will probably do just fine. Plus, the One mini 2 has something the former flagship and its compact version don't - a memory card slot. The BoomSound stereo speakers on the front are a definite asset too. And the looks and build are something you just can't take away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's look at the rest of the key specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini has a lot going for it and there are precious few phones that can make a better first impression. One thing that raises a flag though is price. It would have been difficult to swallow even with the bells and whistles of the One (M8) - in comparison, a Snapdragon 800-powered, water-resistant Xperia Z1 Compact with a 20.7 MP camera will run you much less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the original One is cheaper too where you are, which is doing the One mini 2 no favor - especially considering it's hard to say which one's the mini in that pair. The honeymoon will soon be over and HTC wouldn't want potential buyers, who are always looking around anyway, to start fooling around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony already has an alternative that's tough to resist and Samsung won't take long either. The One mini 2 has character to spare - there's no doubt about it - but can it keep your attention once it has it?</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>What's in the box?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 comes in a familiar retail box and the peripherals include an A/C adapter (rated 1A, as opposed to the 1.5A unit of the HTC One M8), a microUSB cable and the standard HTC headphones with a microphone and extra ear buds (nicely accented in red just like the original HTC One mini).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC One mini 2 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 measures 137.4 x 65 x 10.6mm, which is about the size of the original HTC One. With a pair of stereo speakers either side of the 4.5" display, the One mini 2 is taller than most phones with the same screen diagonal. It tips the scales at 137g - a difference you'll notice if you've handled the 122g HTC One mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini is more compact and weighs a good 30g less - a bigger difference than the 0.2" of display diagonal warrant. The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact has a 4.3" display too and is 10mm shorter. Built of aluminum and glass, it weighs the same. The heavier and thicker Motorola Moto G is shorter too, while offering the same screen size. Even the Motorola Moto X which, has a 4.7" screen, is shorter, slimmer and lighter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC made the move to on-screen buttons this generation, but this didn't help the height problem. None of the above has a meaningful response to those front-facing speakers, of course.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is a compact replica of the HTC One (M8) and proud of it. At first glance you'd be hard pressed to find a difference between the two. The paintjobs are the same, too: Gunmetal Gray (the one we have), Glacial Silver and Amber Gold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gapless unibody of the HTC One mini 2 was molded from aluminum with minimal use of matte plastic. Edges are comfortably rounded for a great feel in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is enclosed within a subtle plastic frame which extends over to the rear to visually divide the battery cover the way the screen and speakers split the front. The thin strips of plastic accommodate the antennae to make sure aluminum doesn't stand in the way of quality reception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cold touch of brushed aluminum against your palm reinforces the premium feel of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The mini 2 is just over a millimeter thicker than the previous model, but the Li-Po battery grew from 1,800mAh to 2,100mAh. This time around, you needn't worry about storage either - the HTC One mini 2's 16 gigs worth of built-in storage can be easily topped with a microSD card. The slot is right below the nanoSIM compartment. The previous generation used the larger microSIM variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exterior differences between the HTC One (M8) and the HTC One mini 2 are quite subtle - the compact version has a little more plastic along the sides and the volume rocker doesn't quite match the brushed metal look of the rest of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Around back, the absence of the dual lens setup and the two-tone LED flash of the One M8 are the giveaways that you are looking at the One mini 2 but other than that, the shape and finish of the two handsets is identical. The One M8's IR blaster is not to be found on the One Mini 2 - the upside is, the mini has the 3.5mm jack at the top, which is the position we prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In any case, we're looking at an extremely well-made device, with premium written all over it. The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is probably the only smartphone that comes close in terms of build and finish.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 mirrors the controls of the bigger HTC One (M8). The front is occupied by the 4.5" 720p display, which now accommodates the Home, Recent Apps and Back buttons - a better solution than the two-capacitive-button setup of the previous generation, but one that should've reduced height too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, one thing that has thankfully not changed is the front-facing speakers, located on each side of the display and hidden under precision-drilled micro holes. The pair doesn't have Beats anymore, but each has its own amplifier instead - just like on the One M8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, an ambient light sensor, proximity sensor and a wide-angle 5MP front-facing camera are either side of the earpiece (within the speaker grille). The main microphone is placed under the bottom speaker grille.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nanoSIM slot is on the left-hand side, while the microSD card on the right - a dedicated tool supplied in the retail box is used to eject the two trays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker is placed under the microSD card slot on the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no IR blaster on the HTC One mini 2, the top side features only the power button and the 3.5mm headphone jack. Another feature missing on the HTC One mini 2, that the bigger HTC One (M8) has, is the ability to swipe-unlock the device even from sleep.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features the microUSB 2.0 port only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another place where the HTC One mini 2 differs significantly from its bigger sibling is the back. There's no Duo Camera setup here and no two-tone LED flash. What you do get is a 13MP camera with a single LED flash. The noise-reducing microphone is next to the LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Handling the HTC One mini 2 is a pleasure. The phone is heavier than its predecessor but with a decisively more premium feel. What raises question is the size, especially the height. So much so that it puts the very name in doubt - the stereo speakers being the only saving grace.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the HTC One mini 2 is a Super LCD2 unit of 720 x 1280 resolution and 4.5 inches of diagonal. This results in a pixel density of around 326ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although not a Super LCD3 as the HTC One M8's, the screen offers great image quality and viewing angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite similar to the screen of the original HTC One mini, this one offers very good brightness and contrast, the only minor letdown being reflectivity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Blacks are deep at both ends of our test - at both 50% and 100% brightness. Speaking of brightness, it's a sufficiently bright screen and its contrast ratio is impressive. The LG G2 mini's screen fades in comparison and it has a lower resolution as well. Motorola's Moto G has a reasonably good 720p screen but it too gets outdone by the HTC One mini 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is quite good, just not the best. The screen performs decently under direct sunlight but it would've done better had it been a little less reflective.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 is powered by a 2110mAh battery, up from 1800mAh in the original, that's quoted at around 16 hours of talk time and 550 hours of standby. For a reference, the Motorola Moto G has a 2070mAh unit, while the LG G2 mini is powered by a 2440mAh monster of a battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The One mini 2 offers Power Saving and Extreme Power Saving modes. The former just dims the screen and throttles down the CPU, while the latter is more advanced and disables multitasking altogether and replaces the launcher with a simplified version letting you only access a basic set of features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 did better than the original but not quite the score we were hoping for. The 50h rating was less than we expected based on the official HTC numbers. For more information here's our full battery test post.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 has quad-band 2G/EDGE support, tri-band 3G with HSPA+ (up to 42Mbps downlink) for the international version and quad-band 3G with HSPA+ for the Asian version. There's quad-band or penta-band 4G support too, depending on the region.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity includes dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n (that's both 2.4GHz and 5Ghz), Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA. There is also stereo Bluetooth 4.0 with the aptX audio codec. There's A-GPS and GLONASS for positioning too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset has a standard 3.5mm audio jack and a microUSB port. The microUSB port is MHL enabled, meaning you can use it to output content to an external screen with the right type of an adapter. The microUSB port can also be used in a USB host mode where you can hook up various USB periphrals to the phone. Of course, you would need an adapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the HTC One (M8) the HTC One mini 2 has support for the HTC Mini+ accessory. You pair the two via Bluetooth and you can then take calls, keep up to date with notifications and more on the little phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is listed as optional and indeed our unit did not have it. HTC hasn't published a list of markets that get NFC, so that's something to check before buying one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense 6 atop Android 4.4.2 KitKat<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 comes powered with the spanking new Android 4.4.2 KitKat decked out with HTC Sense 6. Under Sense 6 the user interface has been improved and it's also better-looking. The built-in apps each have a different accent color which spills out into the status bar, changing its color to create a uniform effect - similar to what we've seen with Apple's iOS 7. Sense 6 looks and feels just like on the HTC One (M8) and there are very little changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a brief rundown of Sense 6 UI on the HTC One mini 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen hasn't really changed much since Sense 5 - there's a clock with weather information and four app shortcuts. Swiping up takes you to the last app you used, while swiping to the left or to the right will take you to the homescreen or BlinkFeed respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 doesn't offer Motion Launch features like on the HTC One (M8). In other words you can't unlock the device with a swipe on its screen or a double tap when the latter is off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you unlock you're greeted by a practically identical homescreen as before and virtual on screen buttons, the biggest change compared to the HTC One mini from a year ago. Having the buttons on-screen ensures better response time and less chance of operational deterioration but also means you're effectively giving up part of your screen estate in order to accommodate them there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background behind the buttons is transparent and they obediently move out the way when you're watching a video or image so it's not that bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status bar is also now transparent thanks to Android KitKat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leftmost homescreen pane of the One mini 2 is once again reserved for HTC BlinkFeed. It aggregates content from your social networks, as well as from various news sources. You can pick what topics you're interested in and BlinkFeed will automatically pull fresh content for you. You can also search for specific content. You can also turn BlinkFeed off if you prefer or choose to not have it be the default homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get up to five homescreen panes to fill with shortcuts and widgets (the sixth is reserved for BlinkFeed). You can set any of the panes as default - including the BlinkFeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is business as usual - you get notifications in the right page and quick toggles in the left. You can access the quick toggles by a tap in the upper right corner or through a two finger swipe from the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer also looks and acts the same. It's vertically scrolled unlike stock Android or most current Android OSes like TouchWiz, Xperia or Optimus UI. Aside from the usual alphabetical and chronological order of apps you can also sort them in a way you see fit. The grid of apps can either be a 3 x 4 or the more sensible 4 x 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting to the recently-opened apps is done with the dedicated on-screen button. The interface shows a list of thumbnails for each app. You can swipe them away one by one as before or use the new close all option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also get to the task manager from the recent apps screen - it shows you the currently active apps and RAM usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu has gotten a look refresh but has a new design with single-color, flat icons and toggles. Everything is where you'd expect it to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wallpapers, lockscreen style, ringtones, notification sounds and alarms can be customized via a dedicated menu. This time around, the lockscreen styles cannot be changed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense has a dedicated Car mode screen. There are five big controls shown by default alongside the clock and weather. There's music info too, which takes a whole row by itself, along with shortcuts to Navigation, Dialer, the Music player (again) and for Voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 also has a built-in restricted access Kid mode. It is an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they can have access to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Everything runs buttery smooth on the HTC One mini 2. The software is well optimized for the hardware within, Sense 6 looks and feels snappy and is very easy to use despite departing from the basic UI laws of Android at places (like the app drawer).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 runs on a midrange Snapdragon 400 chipset with 1 GB of RAM, a quad-core processor with four Cortex-A7 cores clocked at 1.2 GHz each. Cortex-A7 runs very close to its predecessor Cortex-A9 which was all the rage in devices like the Samsung Galaxy S III, HTC One X and others. Despite being close in terms of performance the Cortex-A7 cores consume much less power. The GPU is an Adreno 305. In retrospect the HTC One mini rocked a Snapdragon 400 with a dual-core Krait processor clocked at 1.4 GHz. Since the One mini of old uses a Krait core and not a Cortex core it is more powerful but in turn consumes more power. Other than that, both phones have the same Adreno 305 GPU and the same 1 GB RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is also the same 720p resolution so performance numbers will come down to the different CPU architecture. We'll see whether two more cores at a lower maximum clock speed can do more than before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's jump straight into the tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 and AnTuTu 4 are benchmarks, which put to the test the hardware combo inside the smartphone. GeekBench 3 is more CPU-intensive, whereas AnTuTu 4 is a compound benchmark - testing CPU, GPU, memory performance, etc. The HTC One mini 2 was able to pump out a good score in both. It managed to outdo the LG G2 mini, which has the same hardware as well as the Motorola Moto G. The HTC One mini from a year ago was also no match for the One mini 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single, multi-core performance, math performance and more. We focus on the overall and CPU scores. The HTC One mini 2 got very similar results in both the regular and anti-cheat tests. Just as expected for its midrange position, looking at all the tests, the results weren't very good. And that's not comparing the One mini 2 to the best smartphones out there. It didn't manage to outperform the HTC Desire 816, which has almost the same innards.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up we have GFXBench's 2.7 T-Rex and 3.0 Manhattan. In 1080p offscreen mode the GPU is tasked with performing graphical computations in 1920 x 1080px resolution, while the onscreen mode uses the screen's native 1280 x 720px resolution. T-Rex, which is the older of the two, poses less demanding tests and here the HTC One mini 2 posted an equal result to the LG G2 mini's and a better one than the Moto G's and HTC One mini's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the T-Rex onscreen test framerate doubles to 11 fps but sits behind a great 14.9 fps effort by the LG G2 mini. However both remain unusable and stuttery - anything below 30 fps is laggy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more-demanding Manhattan shows a significant drop in framerate. The HTC One mini 2 posted the same score as the HTC Desire 816 we reviewed recently, which makes sense given that both carry the same chipset and screen resolution with the only exception being a slight RAM increase in favor of the Desire 816.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BrowserMark 2.1 looks after HTML 5 performance, while Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 is JavaScript-centric. The HTC One mini 2 manages a good score in BrowserMark but rather poor in Kraken.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 is a good performer as far as quad-core Snapdragon 400's go. It didn't get passed by its peers like the Moto G or LG G2 mini. But synthetic benchmarks aside, you should know that things load fast and the OS runs smooth. Android 4.1 Jelly Bean saw performance rise tremendously and 4.3 Jelly Bean and 4.4 KitKat added subtle improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The current state of Android allows the HTC One mini 2 to offer commendable user experience. Still, we feel that for this steep asking price, HTC should have bundled it with a more premium chipset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense phonebook is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People app in Sense 6 has seen some minor visual changes, but retains the same functionality as its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the dialer, contacts, groups (including favorite contacts), as well as a call log. You can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays the contact's social networking updates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony does great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC One mini 2 combines your keypad, recent call list and contact list in one application accessible via a single icon. You switch between the view modes with side-swipes. There's smart dialing and it works as good as expected. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number. You can use a QWERTY keyboard for searching as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The smartphone packs a neat set of call-related tricks such as automatically silencing the ring of an incoming call just by putting the phone face down or raising the volume if the device senses it's in a pocket. Our review unit didn't have the feature to automatically answer an incoming call by raising it to the ear, but HTC claims it should be included as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quality of the two loudspeakers remains in line the excellent-sounding HTC One mini from last year and compared to the HTC One (M7) and (M8). The sound comes out deep and well-accentuated. It's particularly nice to enjoy videos or games as the sound comes directly at you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BoomSound enhancement is constantly on when you are listening to something via the loudspeakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Loudness, on the other hand, isn't all that impressive. The HTC One mini 2 didn't perform very well when it came to midtones or vocals. The only place where it was able to score a good volume is the high tones. We got an overall Below Average score when we measured its loudness with our digital loudness meter. Check out more about our tests and our loudness test in particular.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging, email and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One mini 2 is capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. There's also Google Hangouts, which can connect you to Google contacts via either texts or video calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sense 6 intuitively lists all of your conversations in a single thread - whether you're texting the same person on a new number and then go back to the old one - it's all chronologically listed in a single thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single interface with a unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app uses a navy blue top bar and merges it with the status bar for a nice design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for typing, the HTC One mini 2 on-screen keyboard offers well-spaced keys, but the overlay doesn't include any gaps between them. This is only a cosmetic feature and poses no discomfort. The 4.5" display diagonal offers enough space for comfortable typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Trace keyboard is also available. You drag a finger over the desired keys and the phone predicts what you're trying to type. It works really well but language support is limited.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Zoe animates your life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Zoe is a mini social network centered around sharing photos and videos. A landmark feature is the cool Highlights videos, which are created automatically for each album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense 6 features Zoe as a standalone multimedia app, which requires you to sign in with your HTC account the first time you open it. Captured photos and videos are automatically compiled into a Zoe video highlight reel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating a Zoe is easy. You simply choose from the available images and rearrange them in order you like. Themes and soundtracks are available in case you want to be truly creative. Once finished editing, you can easily share Zoes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe also allows you to collaborate with friends on the same project. You can send requests and combine your media content into the same Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app doesn't work in certain locations. In some countries it's still listed as Coming soon but it worked when we tested it from the US.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Slideshow-happy gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The regular image gallery stacks photos together in albums, which can be organized by the date they were captured or the source they come from. Location-based sorting is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, there is an array of available options at your disposal. You can edit, share, highlight, and delete images. You can also set them as backgrounds, assign them to contacts, add them to a specific album, or print them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you open an album, the first and biggest thumbnail is reserved for slideshows. Once you tap it you can customize if you want an effect added over the photos and what sort of music you would like to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery supports viewing your images in their full resolution. You can easily pinch-zoom to 1:1 magnification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display on the HTC One mini 2 is more than adequate in both size and quality to allow for enjoyable image consumption.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the HTC One mini 2 has a rather simple interface. There isn't a dedicated app - you just pick a video from the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to capture images from the video, volume slider, and sharing options. All of these hide automatically after a few seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 video player had somewhat spotty video codec support. It managed to play one or two DivX videos but didn't play five others. MKV files on the other hand weren't a problem all the way up to 1080p. WMV videos were trouble-free as well. XVID played almost every time but had issues with the sound coded (AAC), which otherwise played on other videos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Sense 6 music player features similar layout as the one in the previous version. The flattened interface design however makes the setup look fresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is organized by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders (we don't see this last option very often). The phone will also easily stream songs over DLNA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player can automatically look for and download Album art and artist photos (you can limit it to Wi-Fi connections only), and search for lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no equalizer on board. You have the option to toggle Boomsound audio on or off when you have the headphones plugged in. Like we mentioned already, you cannot disable the feature when playing through the speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM Radio is aboard with RDS support. It automatically saved the available stations and has one of the simplest interfaces we've seen. There are play controls - play, stop, skip and a loudspeaker option.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Cleanest audio output in business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To say that HTC is doing well with the audio output of its smartphones would be a massive understatement. The company is not only consistently delivering devices that set the benchmarks for audio quality, but it's somehow managing to beat its own high standards with each new generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Had the One mini 2 matched the results of its bigger brother, the One (M8), we would be perfectly happy with it and pronounced it the best musician in the mini league. However, the smartphone goes a step further and delivers even cleaner output than the flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The perfect performance with headphones is now par for the course, but this is the first handset we see to be just as good when we plugged in a pair of headphones. Not even the spike in stereo crosstalk that we've come to expect from every smartphone appeared - it does better than what most phone manage to output without any resistance applied to their line-outs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 delivers on the loudness side, too. Through its audio jack it's only a tad quieter than the One (M8), but both are so good that the difference barely matters at that point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No UltraPixels anymore, but image quality is Ultra good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 sees a departure from HTC's Ultrapixel sensor technology and comes with a standard 13 MP snapper on the back, sided by a single LED flash. The main camera sensor is a 1/3.06" CMOS with small 1.12 µm pixel size (compared to the 2 µm of the HTC One M7 and M8). The sensor has a native 4:3 aspect ratio as opposed to the 16:9 wider aspect of its predecessor - photos come out with a resolution of 4128 x 3096 - more than three times the pixel count of the HTC One (M8).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The aperture sits at f/2.2, which isn't as wide as the one on the HTC One (M8) or even as wide as the f/2.0 of the 5 MP front-facing shooter, for that matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This camera is not backed by HTC proprietary ImageChip so a handful of options are missing (Zoe mode most notably). It does have HDR, Panorama (with a digital horizon level), geo-tagging and image effects. The more advanced settings are hidden by default, but you can also control ISO, exposure compensation, white balance and a few other image adjustments.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A long press on the screen will enable Auto Exposure and Auto Focus lock. You can set the volume rocker to act as a zoom lever or a shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 has a 5MP front-facing camera with a BSI sensor and a dedicated selfie mode. From the settings you can enable smile shutter and adjust the Make-up level, which tries to digitally pretty you up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a front-facing sample prepared for you below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 is one of the best cameraphones to come out of the company's factories. It's much the same situation as what we saw on the HTC Desire 816. The two cameras produce identical results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right off the bat, the detail level is very good across the frame. Images come out sharp but the fine detail remains mostly untouched - read not oversharpened like on recent Samsung flagship phones. Edges are almost as sharp as the center, which is very impressive and a step up from the HTC One (M8)'s photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 picked exposure really well each and every time. Colors look punchy and vivid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a fair share of digital noise but we kinda prefer this sparing noise reduction algorithm. An overeager noise reduction would have smeared the fine detail along with the noise so we prefer the balance in this tradeoff just the way HTC has picked it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Face detection on the HTC One mini 2 is always on and cannot be turned off in the settings. It works really well and can recognize a face immediately and even track it well when it moves across the frame. The downside is that when face detection captures a face it will expose for it, which would sometimes ruin your overall exposure, which is a bummer. This can be fixed by manually locking exposure where you want it to be but then you risk losing focus of your subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's face it, when you're taking pictures of people you'd want face detection on so we're not taking points away from HTC here. We just wish there was a setting to turn it off at times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR is short for High Dynamic Range and the HDR mode of the HTC One mini 2 camera snaps a couple of photos with different exposures and then combines them into a single photo. It seems the HDR mode tends to expose for the highlights and then brighten up the shadows in the scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This in turn produces images with nice and even exposure, without a nasty overcontrasty, exaggerated look. You'll note in the images below that the sky is already very well exposed and only slightly accented in the HDR sample but the part of the scene below the sky sees a significant bump in exposure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 is also a great performer when it comes to macro shooting. It would focus from as close as 10 cm. Looking at the macro sample with the little text sign you'll notice that each little fine thread is delivered in great detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a sample taken with the front-facing 5 MP snapper on the HTC One mini 2. It produces good detail all around but make sure you don't get too close as close subjects are out of focus. There is actually a sweet spot somewhere at an arm's length from the camera. The image further away from the camera is out of focus again.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the image quality is not what the 5MP F/2.0 specs suggest on paper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go a couple of 16:9 samples we took. The second one is an HDR shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're glad to see the amount of good work that has gone into the HTC One mini 2 camera. It performs great and offers a good deal of detail. What we like most about the snapper is how mature it renders images - something that's lost on most current top tier smartphones on the market, save for a few exceptions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 offers 1080p videos at 30fps, though there's also a 60fps mode at 720p. The front-facing camera can also record 1080p videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other options include slow-motion video but this one drops the resolution to the measly 768 x 432px. Finally there are image effects and settings for ISO, exposure compensation and white balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p videos captured by the HTC One mini 2 carry a bitrate of around 20 Mbps, which is normal for this resolution. Framerate was a constant 30 fps throughout the video. Audio bitrate sits high up with 193 Kbps and offers two channels (read stereo) and has a regular sampling rate of 48 kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for quality, we're impressed. The HTC One mini 2 is one of the best camcorders to come out of HTC portfolio. It resolves plenty of detail, we'd say about on par with the HTC One (M8) and usually gets exposore spot on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as we saw with the HTC Desire 816, colors tend to be a little on the saturated side but some users prefer them like this. Sharpness is not at its best towards the edges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample to watch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 comes with a Sense-ified version of the stock Android browser and Chrome out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock browser packs the usual features: Incognito tabs, Find in page and Desktop view. Note that GIF animation needs to be enabled from the settings. There is no Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the usual bookmarks, you can keep a Reading list of pages to read later and a Watch list of videos. Pages are saved on-device so they can be read offline, but videos are not. The Watch list feature works on sites like YouTube and Vimeo. It detects multiple videos per page (so you can add them all) and when you're ready, you can check them out without any distractions from the page they were on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is becoming the most popular mobile browser and should be fairly familiar. It has some advantages over its vanilla-flavored buddy, including switching between tabs with a wide swipe from either the left or right of the top bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome has Incognito tabs, too. Speaking of tabs, it can sync what you have open on other devices (desktop, tablets) with the phone. This feature also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites and can remember passwords and login data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Reduce data usage option sends web pages to be compressed on Google's web servers before loading them on the device to save data and speed up slow connections. This doesn't work for SSL-protected pages and Incognito tabs for privacy reasons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC has skinned the Calendar to match the Sense 6 looks. Adding an event lets you specify time (with a warning if there's a conflict with another event), who will attend and where the meeting will be held. Multiple online calendars are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tasks app is another way to organize time. It can handle multiple separate lists of tasks and syncs with your Google account. Each task can have a due date and a location associated with it. Map view lets you easily find nearby tasks, though we would have loved a "Navigate to" button here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Drive comes preinstalled. It combines all of your documents, spreadsheets, images and more in one easy to use data vault app. You can also access more than a single Google Drive if you have multiple profiles on your smartphone, which is neat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock application can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The stopwatch and timer are self-explanatory. There's also a Calculator and a Flash app that sets the power of the back-placed LED to three strengths.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Backup can do manual or scheduled backups of your apps, messages (texts and emails), contacts and accounts (mail and social). The data is sent either to Google Drive or Dropbox and you can limit the app to transfer over Wi-Fi only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice Google searches as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Weather app can give you weather information for your location and others. It looks great and gives you an animated representation of the weather conditions as well as a multiple-day forecast. Weather information is sourced from AccuWeather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Guide app is an excellent app for beginners. It contains tips and help, troubleshooting info and a display of the vital phone stats the support call center might ask you about. The Phone health option offers some self-help tools like running diagnostic on individual components (speakers, backlight, buttons).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app will also help you manage the storage with a handy option to clean unwanted files and trackers for call minutes, texts and data plan megabytes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is the default navigation app, but it's most useful when you use it while you are online. It allows you to download offline maps of an area and even plan routes without a data connection but you can't search for addresses or POIs without an internet connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side, it can plan driving, public transport, cycling and walking routes. It can also display pretty accurate traffic alerts as well (though it doesn't always take them into account when routing you).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another great support tool is Android Device Manager. It's available for all Android devices linked to your Google account. It can help you find your misplaced HTC One mini 2 by ringing it and if it's not at the house, by finding it on the map. If it's stolen, you also have the option to lock the device and delete all data (so make sure you have HTC Backup set up to work automatically so you don't lose your data). You have to enable the remote locking initially via the preinstalled Google Settings app on your smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, Google's Play store hardly needs any description. It the biggest catalog of apps and also features movies, TV, music and even devices but those services are dependent on your country. Opening the store brings you highlighted apps based on recommendations and your usage. There are categories, ranked apps and more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 solidifies a trend, proving once again that HTC can make smartphones with really good, competitive cameras. It shows that HTC can step up where needed and deliver above expectations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 is incredibly well made, a man among boys in terms of build quality compared to its mini peers. It's got an amazing screen and stereo front-facing speakers. There is also the latest Android on board, skinned with HTC's latest Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, it seems the company is stubborn beyond the healthy dose. Some may have trouble accepting the fact that the HTC One (M8) has a worse camera than the mini. Some could argue that the move in the right direction comes too late - at a time when the inner turmoil and disappointing financial performance would be hard to overturn.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that could prove detrimental is the pricing. HTC has positioned the One mini 2 as a premium device and priced it well above what is considered acceptable for a Snapdragon 400-powered smartphone with a 720p screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One mini 2 key test findings:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To put it in perspective, the HTC One mini 2 is priced only ?100 lower than the Samsung Galaxy S5 or HTC's very own One (M8) - and that's way too close for comfort. Unless the price plummets - and fast - specs-conscious users will probably snub the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that could turn buyers away is the size of the phone. This season's mini is as big as last year's flagship and even as big as something like a 5" LG Nexus 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 is near impossible to match in terms of build quality but, at around ?450, it's charging more than what can be considered its main competitors. Let's look at them more closely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola has great offers in the midrange. The company's best-selling smartphone Moto G runs less than half the price and has comparable specs. The screen is the same diagonal and an equally good 720p panel. The processor is the same and the software is almost identical to stock Android, with software updates going to always arrive in due time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto G recently received an LTE version with a microSD card slot as well and it would still cost twice as little when it becomes available some time in June.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Motorola Moto G ? Motorola Moto G 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original HTC One mini has a great unibody, made of high-grade aluminum, a great 4.3" display, front-facing speakers and is noticeably more compact. The screen is smaller, the processor is a couple of cores short and the camera is an underwhelming 4MP unit. On the other hand, the price is easier to swallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 Compact is the closest thing the HTC One mini 2 has to a nemesis. It's cheaper, it easily matches the One mini 2 on looks and build quality, it has a smaller but equally good 4.3" 720p IPS panel and is now getting Android 4.4 KitKat. What it adds is a seriously fast processor, a good 20.7MP snapper and water and dust protection. All that at a lower price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z1 Compact</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG's G2 mini is inferior to the HTC One mini 2 on most fronts. The camera and display resolutions are lower, there aren't any stereo speakers and the entire body is made out of plastic. The screen however is bigger at 4.7" and the phone is considerably smaller overall. The LG G2 mini is also way cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G2 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One mini 2 got praise where it was due but also plenty of critique - we'd like to think both were well deserved. If you think the good outweighs the bad, this isn't a phone you're going to regret. The smartphone may be too large, too expensive and somewhat underpowered, but it's a joy to own and use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC finally nailed the camera performance and the audio output is impeccable. The display and build quality are outstanding. HTC did a nice job with this one, we give them that. At this point though, the sort of budget chipset inside at the current asking price is a shocking mismatch. The One mini 2 is something special and you'll know it right away. Still, getting one at this point in time can't be further away from an act of reason. HTC must believe it's hard enough to resist. Do you?</paragraph>
