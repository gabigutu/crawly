			<paragraph>Relatively limited 3rd party software availability</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Don't let your E71/72 smartphone read this. No, it won't have a heart attack or anything. But you don't want it suddenly feeling sad and useless. You certainly realize the E71/E72 duo is getting old and rusty. Like it or not, it's time to move on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 will not take No for an answer. A super crisp VGA touchscreen, the finessed Symbian Anna, the strong messenger bloodline and the stainless steel armor are a tempting combination. The package will make long-time Eseries users feel right at home and cheer the upgrades.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touchscreen or D-pad is not a decision you're forced to make. It will come naturally instead. Where the small screen won't allow the required level of touch precision, the D-pad will fill in. Five homescreen panes to fill with shortcuts and widgets will do better than the good old Active Standby with alternative setups for business and leisure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most importantly though, to even the most old-school of Eseries loyalists, touchscreen will be a fair price to pay for finally upping the screen resolution to acceptable levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This phone seems to have almost everything - well, save for HDMI and an actual life-size touchscreen. But we're talking Eseries and the E6 is the business. It feels like Nokia really wanted to rekindle the magic. The E6 makes the E72 look like a routine, cursory attempt at an update. Where the E72 wanted quietly keep on cashing in, the E6 is keen to make a difference. A tall task indeed, considering the times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's waste no more time on the introduction and cut to the chase. Follow us on the next page for our traditional hardware inspection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the E6<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With an ample 8 GB of inbuilt storage, the Nokia E6 doesn't come with a memory card in the box. It's a basic package featuring a compact charger, a microUSB cable and a single-piece headset. That's that.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia E6 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 stands at 115.5 x 59 x 10.5 mm. A reasonably spacious control deck separates the 2.46? landscape touchscreen from the comfortable four-row QWERTY keyboard. The phone weighs the respectable 133 grams ? a solid piece with a stainless steel battery cover.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The E6 is a looker - in the traditionally sober, understated style of the Eseries. The premium materials and high build quality go without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had the chance to use both the black and silver version for our review. There should be a white paint job available too. A limited but carefully chosen selection, considering the target audience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the black Nokia E6 tends to get all smudgy, while the silver variety is good at hiding fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the rear, the battery cover and camera deck are made of metal, with bits of matt plastic top and bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The landscape 2.46" 16M-color capacitive touchscreen of VGA (640 x 480) resolution takes almost half of the phone?s face. We never missed an opportunity to slate the Eseries messengers for their poor QVGA screens. Even in their prime, they were put to shame by BlackBerries. The E6 will have no more of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A VGA screen with a 2.46" diagonal has about the same pixel density as the iPhone 4?s Retina display: 326ppi for the Retina and 325ppi for the Nokia E6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive screen of the Nokia E6 is as responsive as they come. It is quick to register even the slightest of touches and even pinch zooming is enabled (in the gallery and web browser). Viewing angles are quite good, the colors vivid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the table with our brightness measurements. You can learn more about the test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our dedicated brightness test confirmed our observations and showed that the Nokia E6 screen is really bright. In fact it's the brightest unit we have seen, dethroning the LG Optimus Black. Its blacks, on the other hand, aren't the deepest we have seen, but they are okay for the LCD league. This means that the overall contrast is, among the best we have seen from an LCD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Something else that the test shows is that the E6 brightness setting has little effect on the actual brightness of the screen. You can see that the difference between the 100% and 50% settings is minimal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The D-pad is welcome when you need to hit small links on websites - and it is perfectly usable to navigate the menus. You can pretend there's no touchscreen if you want. Just one thing: a trackpad would've made quite a lot of sense ? especially in the web browser. The touchscreen is fine but they didn't get rid of the D-pad. Could've easily used the E72 combo and thrown in a trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just above the screen we find the earpiece, a bunch of sensors and the video-call camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen is a spacious navigation deck built around a reasonably tactile and palpably raised D-pad. Call and End knobs are on both ends of the deck, the One Touch keys closer to the D-pad. Soft keys are moved over to the screen. The One Touch keys have the usual varying short press / long press functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard is virtually the same as those on the E5 and C3. The keys are reasonably sized and spaced, with good press feedback. They do feel just a tad softer than the E71 but other than that you shouldn?t have any problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Nokia E6 is quite crowded. The volume rocker is on top, with an extra key squeezed in for activating voice commands (long press) and the voice recorder (short press). Just below is the typical Nokia lock slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a lanyard eyelet at bottom end of the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lock slider has another job too: it turns on the Dual-LED flash to serve as a flashlight. You just slide down and hold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side's only feature is the microUSB port covered with a small plastic lid. There is USB charging and USB-on-the-go functionality provided by the port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top accommodates the hot-swappable microSD slot with a plastic flap, the 3.5mm audio jack and the Power key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only thing at the bottom is the charger port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rearside we find the loudspeaker grill, the dual-LED flash and the 8 megapixel fixed focus camera lens sharing a slightly raised strip of metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the metal cover is the 1500 mAh Li-Ion BL-4D battery, which powers the Nokia E6. The battery is quoted at up to 672 hours of stand-by in a 2G network or up to 14 hours and 40 minutes of talk-time. Nokia is quick to call it one of the best performers on the market. In real life, the battery lasted two and a half days of really heavy usage: playing videos and music, continuous Wi-Fi connection and 3G data transfers, browsing, social networking, document editing, heavy camera action, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Eseries have long been the standard-setter for build quality and the E6 is well on target. This pocket friendly QWERTY messenger has good ergonomics and high-end looks. It's a solid attempt to bring the Eseries up to date and we found the touchscreen / D-pad combo to work fine. The screen resolution is a major upgrade, and about time too Nokia showed its messengers the respect they deserve.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Symbian Anna brings new icons and refreshed homescreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 and X7 are the first devices to have Symbian Anna out of the box. The new release takes the OS to the next level with a more user-friendly and contemporary user interface, an improved web browser, new split-screen for text input and a better homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the homescreen, Anna is showing its fresh coat of polish and a new feature here or there. The homescreen of the E6 consists of five panes, which you can fill up with various widgets (and shortcuts) and reshuffle as you see fit. You can add or delete panes but you don?t get more than five.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen scrolling has been vastly improved - the panes move with your finger, not after you've done the swipe as it was in Symbian^3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the Symbian Anna running on Nokia E6:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are free to rearrange icons as you see fit so you might go for placing them all in the main folder and get a flat-ish menu system. You can create custom folders too, which can help you organize your apps. A list view mode is also available but that involves much more scrolling and that?s why we preferred to leave things in grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager shows screenshots of the running apps, instead of just icons. You also need only a single click to kill them. The downside is the task manager manages to only fit three apps on the screen and you often have to scroll to the one you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A neat feature is the popup available by tapping the top right corner of the screen. It gives you a bigger clock, a shortcut to the connectivity menu, a button for battery info (charge in % and "Activate power saving" shortcut) plus notifications: e.g. missed calls, new messages and others. It just shows the number of events, it won't show you the beginning of a new text message like Android's notification area will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also toggle Wi-Fi and USB connectivity settings from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slide naturally locks or unlocks the screen but if you hold it down you'll turn on the flashlight. The same action will turn it off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 handles very well but Symbian Anna brings no bump in performance compared to Symbian^3, the Anna release is more of a feature, rather than a performance update. Although heavy multi-taskers will frown at the 256MB of RAM we didn?t get any ?Out of memory? errors even with a couple of RAM-intensive apps running in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian Anna is definitely a step in the right direction, but we're afraid the competition has zoomed far ahead. While Apple and Google are trying to outdo each other with all sorts of user interface innovation, Symbian has just caught up with a few years ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One positive change is that there's always a Back virtual key visible, which makes navigating apps simpler.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the Options menu still relies on the menu/submenu structure, which is a relic of the non-touch days of Symbian and is begging to be changed to an Android-like solution (menu key that shows a panel with 6-8 buttons for the most common options, maybe a More button if you really want to dig into the settings).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Good phonebook, the QWERTY saves a few clicks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 comes with almost the same fully functional phonebook that Symbian^3 had to offer. There are a few cosmetic changes plus the new aspect, but that's pretty much everything. The phonebook can be synced with an Exchange ActiveSync account (Gmail offers that too), but as all the previous Symbian versions, the Anna will also cause some annoying problems here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Symbian has been offering users virtually unlimited phonebook capacity and excellent contact management for quite some time but plus some social networking integration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contact details are displayed in two tabs. The first gives a summary of the contact info ? a quick shortcut to call the primary number and then several lines, each of which groups similar info (e.g. tapping the ?Message ? 5 numbers? line lets you pick which number to send the message to). There is a shortcut to the Social Services app too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab just lists all available info sorted by type (names, phone numbers, email and so on). This tab isn't structured so it takes a bit more scrolling to find what you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy - just type something with the QWERTY keyboard and you are in. There is also alphabet scrolling in case you want to use the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting some of your contacts as favorites moves them to the top of the displayed list. This saves you quite a lot of scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can assign personal ringtones and videos to individual contacts. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A really nice touch when editing a contact?s details is the option to enter their address by locating it on a map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The social network integration includes Facebook and Twitter, which should be fine for the vast majority of users. However you will need to go an extra step to check out your contact?s status and then another one to see their profile. We agree it might have created a mess if that was all added to the already lengthy phonebook profile but one of those extra steps is probably redundant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making and receiving calls is vital for a business phone and the Nokia E6 is a champ at it and we didn't experience any poor reception issues or dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing is available on the E6 and is practical as ever. You just punch in a few letters from the desired contact?s name and select it from the list that comes up to initiate a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option that the E6 offers is voice dialing. It?s activated by pressing and holding the call key or the dedicated Voice key in the middle of the volume rocker and is fully speaker-independent. As far as we can tell performs greatly, recognizing all the names we threw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In noisier environments though, its effectiveness might suffer. Bear in mind too, that if you have multiple numbers assigned to a contact, the system will dial either the default number or the first in the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final option for starting a call is via the Favorites widget on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the proximity sensor the screen turns off automatically when you hold the phone next to your cheek during a call. The E6 also has the neat accelerometer-based feature that lets you mute the ringer by turning the phone face down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 sat our traditional loudspeaker test as well. Unfortunately, the phone managed only an Average result. More info on the test, as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A messaging expert<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia 6 is a business oriented smartphone and as such it?s all about messaging. The E6 has an excellent hardware QWERTY keyboard and will tackle all your messaging needs with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All your incoming messages arrive in a common inbox. If you like, you can also get them sorted as conversations, in threaded view. The Nokia E6 uses a common editor for all types of messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stuff like a character counter in SMS goes without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Insert some multimedia content and the message is automatically transformed into an MMS. In that case, the character counter turns into a data counter showing kilobytes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 email client allowed us to setup our Gmail account quite easily, while getting it to sync with an Exchange ActiveSync server required some extra work (we explained that in our Phonebook section). In most cases though, all you need is to enter a username and a password and you will be good to go in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service will run trouble-free on your Nokia E6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages can be ordered by various criteria such as date, sender, subject, priority or even by attachments, searching is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. You can set it to check only on given days and have it check more regularly than usual during peak time (which you can define).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments, signatures and everything you would normally need on a mobile device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Same ol' gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The sweep gestures and getting pinch-zooming are here, but still there is nothing eye-candy inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Symbian^3 predecessors, the E6 finally introduces the kinetic scrolling but not kinetic panning. We are just tired of asking for those simple gestures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The familiar pinch gesture works for zooming in/out, as the double taping or even the on-screen slider. You can't zoom with the volume rocker though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selection of multiple photos for deleting or sharing is available straight from the gallery. There are plenty of sharing options ? you can send the image via MMS, email or Bluetooth or you can share it on Facebook, Twitter and other social networks. To do the latter you should configure your social accounts first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final features of the image gallery include the image tagging system for easier image sorting, the slide show and the albums system (again helping you sort your image database).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, picture browsing is relatively fast even with 12 MP pics, even when you are zooming.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image and video players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia E6 has two very useful apps - the image and video editors. Both have very simple interfaces but offer a powerful set of functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Image Editor you can crop, rotate, resize, apply text/effects/pictures/stamps, clean red-eye effects, etc. Everything is touch-optimized and unless you have really big fingers, you won?t have problems here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Video Editor has two modes - make/edit videos (from your pictures and videos) or create slideshows from your photos. Once again the controls are touch-optimized and really simple to use.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian Anna running on the Nokia E6 has the same music player as Symbian^3 has - the one with the new Cover Flow-like interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s automatic sorting by artist, album, genre and the option to create custom playlists straight on the phone. The music player supports a huge number of formats and it has an equalizer plus a stereo widening feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five equalizer presets, including Bass booster, but you can?t create your own.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in background. In this case you can control it through the music player widget on the homescreen, which also displays the currently running track.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia E6 has a simple UI and supports RDS and alternative frequencies. RDS displays the station name and some extra info (say, their website URL) and the alternative frequencies feature automatically re-tunes the radio to another frequency broadcasting the same station when the first signal is weak.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressive video player with subtitle support (via a small update)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The E6?s video player is even better than the one on the N8 or the E7. It comes with DivX and XviD support out of the box and is quite capable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The playback was silky smooth on all files with a resolution up to and including 720p, which is quite impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The media player app itself only works in fullscreen landscape mode (not that we need anything beyond that). When in fullscreen, a press on the screen shows the controls, which are normally hidden. The screen is quite small so we recommend using the zoom to fit option so you can enjoy what you are watching the most.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The E6 handled everything we threw on it - all the AVI, MP4, MKV and even WMV files played like a charm. It also comes with subtitle support (there is an update waiting for this right after you turn on the handset), but don?t expect lots of supported languages. The handset is also capable of playing files bigger than 2GB unlike its predecessors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some restrictions do apply, though. The E6 can't play MOV files and can't handle the audio AC3 codec. If some of your files are encoded with AC3 (the MKV ones for example), you won?t hear any sound while playing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any lag while testing with our samples both in playing or fast-forwarding.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Impressively good audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like most of its family members we have tested recently, the Nokia E6 did great in our audio quality test. Pretty loud and clear, it really deserves a pat on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When attached to an active external amplifier (i.e. your car stereo or your home audio system) the Nokia E6 does marvelously with no weak points whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There wasn't much quality deterioration when we plugged in headphones either (it's even less than on the multimedia flagships of the company, the X7 and the N8). Sure, the stereo crosstalk got a bit worse and we recorded some increase in intermodulation distortion but both of those readings are still quite a lot better than average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixels photos but without the autofocus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 is equipped with an 8 megapixel camera for a maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels and it?s accompanied by a dual-LED flash. However, this is Nokia?s 8MP fixed-focus camera module, which trails behind in the 8MP shooter race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is far from friendly - there are only three shortcuts available in the viewfinder. Those allow you to toggle camcorder and still camera, set the flash and access the rest of the customizable settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The remainder of shooting options is put in the Settings menu (which is an update since Symbian^3 where you needed to go to another Settings menu). Here you can change scenes, ISO, white balance, exposure, adjust contrast and sharpness, turn the Face detection on/off, activate self-timer, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for geo-tagging, it lets you record your current location in the EXIF information of the photos, using the built-in GPS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, image quality is a traditional weak spot for the 8 megapixel fixed-focus Nokia smartphones. Even some of the problems we met with before are solved, this is still not enough. The contrast and the colors are good, but despite its 8MP resolution, the captured detail isn't all that much, there is excessive noise too and corner softness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand if you don't need the full 8MP resolution (an let's be honest - most of us don't) then after a quick downsizing the results are quite acceptable and should satisfy most of the users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried a close-up shot ? a known weakness of fixed-focus cameras and we weren?t surprised at the results. Anything closer than 50 cm and you can kiss any semblance of sharpness goodbye.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 8MP fixed-focus shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There you can see for yourself that the Nokia E6's 8 megapixel fixed-focus camera falls behind most of the competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia E6 in our Photo Compare Tool</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Very good video recording despite the lack of auto-focus<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Still imaging is not the E6?s strong suit but the video recording helps the camera save face. The Nokia E6 shoots in 720p resolution at 25 fps and offers digital image stabilization. Clips are stored as MP4 files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To sum it up, the videos shot with the Nokia E6 did manage to impress us. The amount of resolved detail is good, colors look nice, noise levels are kept low. Most videos stayed very closely to the 25fps mark and were very smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price of the lower compression affects the file size ? 15 seconds of video take about 26 MB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 camera also uses the clever zooming technique that Nokia first used on the N8. It allows you to zoom up to 3x while shooting 720p video without losing sharpness or detail as you normally would and generally works very well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s an untouched video sample from the Nokia E6 ? 720p@25fps. You can also check out this longer sample we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the Nokia E6 in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 720p mobile camcorders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The still shots might not be impressive, but the HD videos are definitely something to look forward to. The videos produced by the Nokia E6 are quite good whatever you are comparing them to.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity well geared<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia spared no expense when it comes to the connectivity of the Nokia E6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, all kinds of network connectivity options are at your disposal - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSPA (10.2 Mbps HSDPA and 2.0 Mbps HSUPA). The GSM/EDGE networking comes in quad-band flavor and the 3G covers all the five bands available worldwide ? 850/900/1700/1900/2100 MHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth connectivity is version 3.0 with stereo support and there's a WirelessN-enabled Wi-Fi radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB is version 2.0, with the standard microUSB port capable of charging the phones besides transferring data. We already covered the USB On-The-Go functionality, but just for the record, we had very little trouble connecting to USB mass storage devices - phones (including Andoids), card readers and thumb drives. Unpopular card formats were a problem though but how often would you need to connect a CF card anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 3.5mm port rounds off the wired connectivity where you can connect a standard Nokia 3.5mm A/V cable for both audio and video output. There is no high-definition TV output though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Updated web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Symbian^3 didn?t deliver the browser overhaul that the platform needs desperately despite the added multi-touch and FlashLite 4.0 support. Symbian Anna is here to make up for this and Nokia E6 is granted with a better web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new browser (v7.3) promises faster loading times, better responsiveness, search-integrated address field, always visible back button and more. The reality is quite close to what Nokia has promised - the new browser is indeed both faster and more responsive, with improved history and address field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is better tab management now similar to the iOS's Safari - you choose the dedicated Windows key from the menu and then you can add or close tabs or just scroll between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser has better page rendering and offers some nice features such as different font sizes (5 options), auto fill-in of web forms and a password manager. Double tap and pinch zooming work good, but the smaller screen makes the double tap gesture feels more natural here. There is also support for kinetic scrolling, which also seems to work quite well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The address field auto hides when you scroll the page down and supports search. When you type something you need to choose explicitly the search option below, otherwise you'll probably get an error.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Find-on-page feature enables keyword search. The visual history is a nice bonus that can help you find a page you've visited more easily. There's also a popup blocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Flash Lite 4.0 support is enough for playing flash videos, but YouTube plays only up to 360p videos so you might as well be using the mobile site. Also, Flash games don?t work so it seems like a good idea to use the option to switch Flash off to cut down on loading times and save some yourself some data traffic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E6 offers generally good experience. Its performance is still nowhere near most of its competitors today, but is a huge step into the right direction. And the best part is this browser will surely satisfy most of the E6 targeted users.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Office document editor onboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 comes with an Office document editor out of the box (Quickoffice). It has plenty of features and it even doubles as a file manager. The Recent files option is the fastest way to go back to some of the documents you?ve worked on lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quickoffice can view and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents. All the Office docs open directly in editing mode, there is no viewing-only. Pinch zooming is supported everywhere and works like a charm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editors have plenty of features ? advanced formatting, editing tables, full list of Excel functions and so on, but their menu/submenu based interface is less than user friendly and while it?s not a deal-breaker, it certainly detracts from the ease of use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The PowerPoint editor was the worst offender here ? it can?t edit when you zoom in and once you do start editing, you need several clicks just to change the text in a label.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing documents is generally fast enough even when you are working with the Office 2007 docx format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the file managing functions of Quickoffice, it?s not better than the standard File browser and we did notice slight (but annoying) lag when scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For viewing PDF files, there?s the standard Adobe app - it's quite sluggish, but supports pinch-zooming which works reasonably fast.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has it covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The E6 is Nokia?s business flagship and they?ve made sure that the phone comes with a very capable organizer out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different view modes - monthly, weekly, daily and a to-do list, which allows you to check all your To-Do entries regardless of their date. There are three types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has some specific fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 comes with a Zip Manager and a mobile antivirus program (F-Secure) preinstalled, which along with the Office package make for a very well-rounded productivity suite.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator application is very familiar but it lacks the functionality of some of its competitors. The square root is the most advanced function it handles and this is hardly an achievement. If all you do with it is split the bill at the bar though, you're more than good to go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a dictionary, voice recorder, as well as the Notes application. The good unit converter we?ve come to know from Symbian^1 is strangely gone but you can grab one yourselves from the Ovi store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, set-off day and repeat pattern. As we already mentioned, thanks to the built-in accelerometer you can also snooze the alarm by simply flipping your phone over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally there is the Message Reader app, which can read all of yours text messages aloud.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Social networking integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 comes with social networking integration, part of which we saw in the phone book. The Social app however is the nexus for al things social - it supports the two most popular networks, Facebook and Twitter. You can have multiple accounts on each network but only one of each can be active at a time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook section offers extensive options with an easy to use, touch-optimized user interface. Posting a status update is simple as is attaching a photo or video (or shooting new ones on the spot) as well as adding geo-tagging information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Twitter is accessed through a similarly easy interface. There's a handy button to shorten links and you can attach photos and videos to your tweets as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool feature is the All Activity section that becomes available when you add both Facebook and Twitter accounts. It pools status updates from both networks into a single list. You can also post a status update on both networks simultaneously from here. Unfortunately, there's no option to post only to one of the networks - you have to go to the networks specific section to do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Friend search also becomes available on both networks - it searches both accounts for a given name.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Ovi Store for Symbian<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian is still one of the most popular smartphone OSes in the world but its application store is pretty barren compared to the two juggernauts, the iOS App Store and Android's Market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The company has refreshed their Ovi store interface to make it more user-friendly for Symbian^3 and it's what you get on Anna too. And while the UI is indeed very handy to use, the number of apps is somewhat of a problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default screen shows a list of featured apps or you can browse the apps available in the Ovi Store by categories ? Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections ? Summer Gift of Games, Chat Collection, Apps Start Kit, Travel, Tools for Professionals and Apps for Kids are the collections available at the time of this writing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps record of all the apps you have installed under My stuff. You can now also select where games and apps should be installed and where audio and video should go. That?s nice ? we wish Android had that right from the start.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Free GPS navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E6 comes with a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a satellite lock from a cold start (A-GPS turned off) in a little under two minutes. You also have A-GPS for getting a faster lock or use Cell-ID/Wi-Fi positioning if you don?t need the accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you probably know since the start of the year Nokia made their Ovi Maps navigation free for all their smartphones, which naturally includes the E6. The voice guidance is currently available in over 70 countries and over 40 different languages, with even traffic information for more than 10 of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition, Nokia did a pretty decent job of the Ovi Maps application itself, blessing it with a cool, touch-friendly interface, as well as nice features such as the Lonely Planet city guide, HRS hotels and the Michelin restaurant guide. There's also an Event guide that lists all that?s happening within a 3km range of your position.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Ovi Maps 3.06 you get three different view modes including satellite and terrain maps. Those however do need an internet connection. The more regular 2D and 3D view modes are also at hand and can be used with preloaded maps. Pinch zooming and downloading maps straight to the phone via Wi-Fi work like a charm here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Updating Ovi Maps if it doesn?t come with the latest version out of the box is quite worthwhile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route planning algorithm is also rather easy to customize to best suit your preferences. Toll roads and motorways can be avoided and so can tunnels and ferries. Routes can be set to either fastest or shortest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ovi Maps is also usable for pedestrian navigation or you can switch the GPS receiver off and use the phone as a hand-held map.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's been almost two years since the E72 was keen to stress it was business as usual for the Eseries. It now seems like an eternity. A few iPhone versions and Android releases later, the business is not what it used to be and Nokia have been learning it the hard way. Tablets are all over the place, dual-core?s in charge and even BlackBerry want a piece of the touchscreen pie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What about the Eseries? Well, they?ve been trying to adapt. The neat and reliable E5 is the younger, friendlier face of the Eseries, affordable and social. The E7 is the usual solid job, which, under different circumstances, could?ve been a flagship to fear and respect. Nokia have been trying to keep up with the rest to the best of their ability. Symbian Anna lifts their game and some of their recent phones look to win back some of the lost pride.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The E6 is called to take over from the E72, connect the dots between the past and the present. The Eseries spirit is so intact it leaves a major upgrade somewhat in the shade. The screen makes quite a difference - mostly for the bump in resolution, less so for actually being a touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should note though, that the latest Symbian Anna helps appreciate the QWERTY/touchscreen combo. And the improved media package makes the E6 a better entertainer than its Eseries predecessors. The new Symbian browser is another point in favor. It?s the browser too ? along with text editors ? that makes the D-pad a credible addition to the multi-touch enabled capacitive touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keyboard and touchscreen is a combination that works and one that Nokia has already tried in the sweet little X3-02 Touch and Type. It?s not alien to a smartphone context either: from olden-day PocketPCs to messenger droids in the bar form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even RIM are giving it a try with the BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900. We?re looking forward to yet another chapter of the Eseries rivalry with BlackBerry when the Bold Touch is released this September. The latest RIM invention is based on the BlackBerry OS 7.0, runs on a 1.2GHz processor (double the clock speed of the E6), has the same high-res touchscreen but slightly bigger and an optical trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> BlackBerry Bold Touch 9900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC ChaCha should be in the picture too, though it?s not exactly a threat ? it targets a younger demographic than the E6, and falls in a lower price bracket. The Facebook-experience HTC ChaCha runs Android 2.3 Gingerbread with Sense on top. It?s got an inferior HVGA display a few things missing, including a document editor and free voice-guided navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC ChaCha</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another recent Android messenger is Samsung's Galaxy Pro B7510. It?s probably in the same league as the HTC ChaCha, obviously cheaper running Android v.2.2 Froyo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Pro B7510</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looks like a two-horse race ? we?re not sure we can count the Motorola Pro, which is due later this year. With a proper 3? touchscreen, it?s almost a different from factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, it was time for the Eseries to move on and Nokia couldn?t have done better than the E6. With phones like the N8, N9 and the X7, Nokia is busy showing us they still have it in them. The E6 has nothing to be ashamed of in this company. Is this enough for it to hope to leave a footprint the size of the E71? Probably not. No one knows that better than Nokia themselves. They deal with the message rather than kill the messenger.</paragraph>
