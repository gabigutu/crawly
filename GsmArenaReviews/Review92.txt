			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When the Samsung S3650 Corby was announced hardly anyone saw it as something more than a nice looking handset that comes on a really attractive price. As it turns out though that event was the birth of a whole new family that promises to change the way we look at touchscreen handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So several weeks later we made sure that we won't repeat the same mistake and paid all the due attention to the second wave of Corbys announced. Luckily, we were able to attend the official announcement event held in Milan and got a chance to see the new devices live right after their official announcement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite as the rumors suggested, what we saw was the first public appearance of two new Corby handsets. The Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT and Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO have quite similar design to their brother, but their designation is completely different. They are also placed either side of the original Corby in the ranking of the company's mobile phone portfolio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT will address the needs of heavy texters on a very tight budget while the B5310 CorbyPRO will hardly come as cheap but introduces a lot of high-end features to the family, while still retaining the signature colorful and youthful appearance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distinct youthful appeal is what unites the Corby family but each of its members has plenty of character of its own. That last two additions show that Samsung see enough space available on the market for budget QWERTY handsets to justify their development. Judging by the popularity of the LG KS360 they might be quite right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The larger of the two Korean manufacturers is playing catch-up this time, but that doesn't mean that they aren't going for the win. The Corby family new members have a lot of potential and LG will have a hard time retaining its market supremacy against them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So now that you know what to expect you can join us on the next page to see what kind of first impression the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO makes. It looked pretty nice on that official presentation at least.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO is trying to combine two things that seemed pretty incompatible not too long ago. Upper mid-range functionality and the higher price tag it suggests aren't exactly what young texters want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However Samsung obviously wanted to give the young professionals who do a lot of typing and messaging but don't need smartphone clumsiness the ultimate tool. It might not be even nearly as versatile as a WinMo or a Symbian handset but sometimes you need performance rather than versatility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of you probably already know that but just for the protocol let's start by having a look at what the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO has to offer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have to admit that we have a thing for metallic designs so the all plastic construction feels awkward at times, but hey, it's just us. Teens and tweens will probably adore its bold colors and nice customization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset comes with the latest reincarnation of the Samsung proprietary TouchWiz UI and normal operation is pretty much identical to the one of the Samsung S3650 Corby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the much ampler screen and the QWERTY keyboard give you the impression that you are working with a higher-tier handset. We can hardly say that it's the dream of the businessman but with HSDPA, Wi-Fi and a document reader onboard you have all the basics perfectly covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All your emailing needs are well covered too and the heavy social networking integration is going to appeal to exactly the right audience. Besides the TouchWiz interface with the animated Comic UI themeing seems to be a nice match for the whole youthful-attraction thingy with its colorfulness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly, one of the key features of the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO is its slide-out full-QWERTY keyboard. Using a four-row layout it takes most of the characters only a single click away with the numbers being the most obvious exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we don't think here is the place for debating whether 3, 4 or 5 is the right number of rows for such a keyboard but we are going to say that we are pretty happy with the one on the B5310 CorbyPRO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keys are large enough for most users and even users, having lager-than-average hands are bound to get used to them fairly quickly. The extra large space is a welcome addition as the most frequently used key certainly deserves easy access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have to admit that the QWERTY keyboard adds some bulk and the slim profile is nowhere to be seen here. Perhaps that's our main grudge with the PRO.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only other important controls on the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO are the three keys at the bottom of display which are identical, although sized up versions of what we saw on the original Corby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that we have no complaints about the usability and user-friendliness of the Samsung B5310 CorbyPRO. The screen has turned resistive as opposed to capacitive, but touch sensitiveness seems unchanged - especially with the snappier overall performance,</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI performance was commendable as well and we can surely say the CorbyPRO must have more horsepower under its hood than the original Corby. But of course, we are to pass the final verdict on that once we receive a final unit for a full review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The question that remains however is whether there will be enough demand for such a handset. The young professionals and social network addicts will certainly consider it but whether they will choose it over the competing smartphones is yet unclear. As always in this market segment pricing is crucial here as even seemingly minor alternation can be the difference between success and failure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's move on to the second star of the night. Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT live photos await you right after the jump.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are a really heavy texter in need of a QWERTY keyboard but don't want (or have) much to spend on your next handset your choices are pretty limited. Luckily here comes Samsung to the rescue releasing another no-nonsense handset that should take care of your messaging just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the list below there is hardly anything to increase the price of Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT insensibly with the features covering nothing but the bare minimum. The 2 megapixel cameras are now probably worth pennies to manufacture, while the number of other unessential features has been brought down as much as possible.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So with the Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT being such a no-nonsense handset there is very little room for surprises really. The Samsung proprietary non-touch UI is well time-tested and even if not the most up-to-date can cover all your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably our biggest regret about the CorbyTXT is the low-res display unit that it utilizes. The QCIF resolution is long outdated and even if it certainly is really cheap to manufacture we would have preferred a QVGA screen instead. Considering that the QVGA equipped Nokia 7100 Supernova retails for 125 US dollars the screen alone cannot be that expensive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>2.2 inches in diagonal is also smallish but on the positive side it has allowed the CorbyTXT body to remain compact. Indeed the handset is really easy to squeeze in your pocket, the slim 12.9mm waistline counting big time here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally typing on the CorbyTXT isn't nearly as nice as on the CorbyPRO but this is only because the bar was set too high. For a bar full QWERTY handset, the Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT fares more than decently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is an almost exact copy of the one on the Samsung B7330 OmniaPRO and you know how much we liked that one. Even the ergonomics are pretty similar providing nice tactile feedback for each key for maximum typing convenience and speed. In fact for a moment we had a deja vu holding the CorbyTXT but thinking of B7330 OmniaPRO. But we digress.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly the coolest value added feature of the Samsung B3210 CorbyTXT are the interchangeable back panels that provide a quick and easy way (not to mention relatively cheap) of customizing the handset's looks. Of course this feature is present on all the devices from the Corby family but it's the most important for the CorbyTXT as it gives the otherwise entry level handset some character.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leaving the cool fashion jackets aside, the Samsung B3210 is basically a what-you-see-is-what-you-get handset that one will be able to find on the really cheap. It is one of those devices that are the easiest to decide for or against purchasing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there isn't anything missing on the specs sheet that you cannot live without and you like the design, then just go ahead and grab yourself a shiny new B3210 CorbyTXT. The performance is surely going to provide on the promises (extremely limited as they may be) made by the features.</paragraph>
