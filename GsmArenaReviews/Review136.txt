			<paragraph>For today's show and tell, Samsung's first Android phone is serving Cupcake. The Samsung I7500 a.k.a. Galaxy is the first Google-powered device to come with a 5 megapixel camera and that's just the tip of much improved multimedia skill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is just a preview and it should serve to whet your appetite as the I7500 prepares to launch. As soon as we get our hands on a final version, we'll grab our tool bag and make an out-and-out review. For now, we'll just share our first impressions of the device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I7500 Galaxy at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Version 1.5 of the Android OS brings some very welcome refinements. The on-screen keyboard is obviously one of them, now that Android powers a full touch handset with no keyboard at all. Video recording and playback have also been included - both strangely missing in version 1. Stereo Bluetooth is aboard as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also some UI polish and plenty of work done under the hood. Extensive bug fixes and improved performance should make the OS even more enjoyable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we begin, it would be fair play to note that in this preview we're using quite an early version of the device and it's not all shipshape. The most noticeable absentees are the camera samples, but the obviously undercooked Camera app does the handset no justice. A good 5 megapixel snapper is a valuable feature and we have every reason to believe Samsung will get it right before launch.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I7500 Galaxy 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 115 x 56 x 11.9 mm this is the slimmest Android phone in our database. Well, that's not saying much as the rest of the competition still makes it in the top 3 anyway, but the Samsung Google phone is quite easily pocketable. The weight of 119 grams isn't quite as breezy as - say - some Symbian phones, but it's on par with the HTC Magic and lighter than the iPhone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For quite a while, the T-Mobile G1 had sole title to the Google phone nickname. The HTC Dream (the non-T-Mobile-branded version of the G1) and HTC Magic obviously have the same genes. The first thing that comes to mind when you see the I7500 Galaxy with the screen turned off is, clearly and undoubtedly, Samsung.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only when the screen lights up do you realize that Android's inside. The screen is easily the best part of the hardware - a 3.2" HVGA capacitive OLED touchscreen. We should note that our unit had a greenish tint but again, it's an early version with many issues still to sort out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is very responsive, reacting to even the lightest touch. Once the green tint problem is dealt with, the display should get the amazing vibrancy typical of OLED screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware buttons are where the user interface has changed the most. The trackball was replaced with a regular D-pad (a very old-school Samsung D-pad, we should add) and, while the other controls are the same, their layout and styling has changed. So if you're coming from a G1 you'll need a few minutes before you feel at home.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the back key is obvious enough, the I7500 menu key is marked by an arrow pointing up from a square bracket. That doesn't exactly scream "menu". The home key - that looks like an Nseries multimedia knob - is squeezed between the back and end button. The Home key is small but comfortably raised, so pressing it is trouble free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The styling of the phone is quite plain, more on the cheap than the conservative side. It's plastic all around, and the silvery accents on the control and navigation pad do little to glam up the basic piano black front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the I7500 Galaxy are not that different from the G1. On the left there's just the volume rocker. The right-hand side has the shutter key, which can be half-pressed to handle autofocus, and a hold key typical of Samsung touch phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the need for a Hold key is questionable. In the G1, the end call button locks the display anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the I7500 Galaxy there's an application called "Spare Parts", which allows you to make minor tweaks like changing the behavior of the End button. You can set whether the End key should lock the phone, return to home screen or go to homescreen and then lock. We hope it gets updated to control the behavior of other buttons too. A user-configurable Hold key could be very helpful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top has the microUSB port and a lanyard eyelet and - guys at HTC, pay attention here! - a standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The all-plastic rear is rather plain. The only embellishment is a dot-printed world map to subtly hint of Google's global reign ? erm, sorry? reach. The camera lens, single loudspeaker grill and the Samsung and Google logo are all there is at the back of the I7500 Galaxy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel camera lens is enclosed in a slightly raised frame, which also accommodates the LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back panel reveals the easily accessible SIM compartment. Unfortunately, that's how you get to the microSD card slot as well. The memory card slot is under the battery cover, but the card can be swapped without removing the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Samsung I7500 Galaxy is pleasingly compact and the hardware controls are quite roomy. It sits well in the hand, its 11.9mm of thickness count for a lot of that. The Plain Jane styling borders on cheap and comes out a bit too boring for a handset that's debuting a brand new OS in the Samsung portfolio. The handset has a distinct Samsung face though and the brand's loyal customers will perhaps appreciate that. The other positive thing is that we have no reason to question the phone's long-term durability.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A robot's user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have quite an extensive description of the Android UI basics in our T-Mobile G1 review, so to keep things short in the Samsung I7500 preview we'll just try and focus on the changes brought by the latest revision of the OS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Virtual on-screen keyboard for small robotic fingers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The biggest change in the Samsung I7500 Galaxy obviously is the switch from a physical to a virtual keyboard. It does the whole-letter pop up each time you press a key but there's something to look out for - three dots under the letter. If those appear, a press and hold will bring up all available related symbols - the letter with all the diacritics for example. The keyboard also auto rotates to landscape thanks to the accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The I7500 virtual keys are smallish - especially in portrait mode - and typing could be very error-prone. Otherwise, the keyboard offers helpful features like a ".com" button when you're typing an URL, or a "Next" button when there are more fields to fill in, with that button changing to "Done" at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You will spot that the Apple iPhone keyboard is physically larger. The larger screen estate surely adds to that despite the lower resolution. But the most important difference with the I7500 Galaxy is that the iPhone keys are more loosely spaced apart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Folders go alive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've all seen phones boasting on-screen widgets that notify of new emails or display an RSS feed. With version 1.5 on the I7500 Galaxy, Android is trying out an interesting solution to unify such things and make them an inherent part of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The solution is called "Live folders". The main difference with ordinary folders is that the live folders are automatically filled with content. For example, there's a "Contacts with phone numbers" and a "Starred contacts" live folders. They do what you would expect them to do - they are filled with contacts that have phone numbers or are starred.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nothing particularly exciting so far, but that's not even half of it. A live folder can be populated with your emails, playlists, an RSS feed, bookmarks and so on. There's a simple API to provide content for live folders. In non-programmer talk, this means it's easy to write programs that stay in the background and fill the various live folders with custom content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, it won't be long before Twitter live folders become available, or a folder for your Netflix queue, or just about anything, that can you can make a list out of. We think this is a great way to deliver dynamic content to your homescreen from many sources without it becoming a colorful mess of differently styled widgets.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Miscellaneous chrome plating<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are some minor additions in terms of eye candy as well - switching between apps causes the current app to zoom out and "throb" while the other app loads. Another minor tweak to the I7500 OS is the shading of the buttons, which gives them a more elaborate look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another of the more useful additions is the ability to filter the list of applications in the "Manage applications" menu - you can choose to view running apps or apps from third-party sources. You can terminate running apps, turning this into a simple task manager (there are more advanced ones in the Marketplace).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the I7500 Galaxy Settings menu, there's a new addition called Locale &amp; text. It allows you to pick a different locale (which changes the language of the UI), change some keyboard settings and access the user dictionary. That last bit lets you teach autocomplete new words.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The music player is the same<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There aren't any visible changes to the Music player, the only worthwhile addition is a music player widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It does what any other music player widget does - display track info and add a play/pause button and a skip button to your homescreen. The widget doesn't offer fast-forward and there isn't a skip back button. A tap on the widget brings you straight to the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player the Spartan way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were quite disappointed with the lack of a video player in the original version of Android (although we found a silly hack to view 3gp files through email). Luckily, there's a dedicated video player on board the I7500 Galaxy? well, sort of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's about as simple as you can make it - once you hit the video player icon you get a list of all videos available on the phone. And the interface while playing a video consists of play/pause, next and previous buttons, as well as a draggable progress bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The I7500 Galaxy video player seems to support only the H.263 codec but since the application crashed when trying to play other files, we suspect it's a long way from finished. Perhaps it won't be far fetched to see even DivX/XviD support implemented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the app really needs is some UI to filter videos like the one in the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The I7500 Galaxy or the Samsung's take on the Google phone is a solid device with all the gadgetry we've got used to in smartphones. We're very eager to get our hands on a final version and see how the camera performs - YouTube and Picasa integration that will be part of v1.5 would turn it into an even more connected device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ample 8GB of internal storage and microSD expansion, topped with a 3.5mm audio jack and A2DP make the I7500 a worthy competitor to dedicated music players and Samsung sure know good audio quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung I7500 however is more important than that as it marks an important point in the history of the Android OS - it's the first working non-HTC device running the OS. Yes, Androids have a long way before them but they don't give in to their more mature market adversaries.</paragraph>
