			<paragraph>HP had their announcements out of the way a few days before the actual start of the MWC so we can now skip straight to the hands-on experience. The powerful Pre 3 and the cute little Veer were both in attendance and happy to pose for our camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here the two are together. You can get an idea of them, size-wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also got a glimpse of the HP Touchpad tablet, though it was fixed to a desk so we couldn't quite enjoy the full experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a side note, the Palm logo was nowhere to be seen at the booth so we guess we can officially start getting used to calling the whole thing HP.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HP Pre 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HP Pre 3 is a marvelously performing device with a taste for multitasking. Needless to say, its pebble shape makes it fit perfectly in any hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As is to be expected from a device with a 1.4 GHz CPU, the Pre 3 is a silky-smooth performer. Multitasking is what webOS really loves to do so having quite a few "cards" running in the background doesn't slow things down at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>webOS is one of the most user-friendly and nicely looking platforms on the market and if HP manage to get that application store of theirs up to speed they might be back up there with Android and iOS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The QWERTY keyboard is pretty comfortable, though we couldn't achieve the same typing speed on the oval keys as on a BlackBerry Bold. Still, the overall ergonomics of the Pre 3 are quite good and with little practice even long emails will be breeze.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We could have used a virtual QWERTY for those cases when you need to input just a few symbols, but that's not the webOS way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In general, we are very impressed with the Pre 3 and we find it to be the right choice of device to mark HP's return to the smartphone business.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HP Veer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And the little fella here is the HP Veer. It brings midrange smartphone power and a full hardware QWERTY keyboard in a body so neat and round and small you cannot help but love.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new webOS development tools allow multiple screen resolution support so you can rest assured that most of the apps for the Pre 3 will be available for the Veer too. The exceptions being, of course, the ones that require more processing power than the little fella can provide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now we did find the keyboard on this one to be quite small for our oversized fingers, but then again, we get the feeling that we are not exactly the Veer target market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ladies with a thing for messaging on the go will surely find the HP Veer an attractive proposal. If only there were more feminine color versions it would look like like a certain hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now don't get us wrong - the black version is pretty stylish too and if they get the pricing right, the Veer might lead to a surge in the webOS market share.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HP TouchPad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And finally here comes the heavy artillery - the HP TouchPad tablet. The webOS cards interface is even cooler on a screen this big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we departed the HP booth we also managed to do a UI demo video of the HP TouchPad. Check it out!</paragraph>
