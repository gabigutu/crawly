			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Keen to place a contender in every nook and cranny of the smartphone market, Samsung are bringing the Galaxy Ace Plus on as a substitute for their midrange Galaxy Ace. Boasting a slightly bigger screen and a faster processor, the Galaxy Ace Plus could just be the right stepping stone for those coming from a dumbphone. It should be a relatively inexpensive upgrade of an entry-level droid too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have gone the extra mile with the Galaxy Ace Plus, treating it to Gingerbread 2.3.6 and the latest version of their TouchWiz UI for a more refined experience. There's been a boost to performance too. One thing that Samsung knew they needed to address was the poor video recording on the original Galaxy Ace. VGA @ 30 fps may sound like a waste of a 1GHz processor, but at least it's something, considering the predecessor had to make do with the miserable QVGA @ 15 fps. Here's what else the Galaxy Ace Plus has to offer.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung I9001 Galaxy Ace Plus at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace Plus seems to be covering all its bases as a sensible midrange smartphone. It's not that the original Galaxy Ace has raised the bar too high, but it feels like Samsung fixed most of what needed fixing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should be looking at an updated package that's well within the budget limits of the original. Our first encounter with the Galaxy Ace Plus S7500 begins with a hardware checkup right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus has grown in both height and width to accommodate a bigger 3.65" touchscreen. The difference in size from the original Ace is negligible though, meaning the increased screen real estate mostly comes at the expense of the bezel. At 114.5 x 62.5 x 11.2 mm the Galaxy Ace Plus won't make a bulge in your pocket and allows easy single-hand operation. The 115 g of weight are on the light side, but it's an all plastic handset after all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace Plus isn't vastly different from the original, meaning it will have to stave off unflattering comparisons to the iPhone. Loyal Samsung users will probably liken it to the Galaxy S. Anyway, it's pretty much standard touchscreen bar design with rounded edges and a single hardware button up front.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the device is mostly touchscreen, 3.65 inches of it to be precise, and HVGA (320 x 480) resolution. The screen quality of the Galaxy Ace Plus is somewhat disappointing. The display is bright enough with good sensitivity but that's where the flattery ends. Viewing angles aren't the best around, contrast is passable when the screen is viewed head on, but quickly lost at even the slightest tilt. Having a slightly bigger screen, the Galaxy Ace Plus has lower pixel density (~158) than the original, and bits of the UI do look grainy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a pretty clean front design: there's an earpiece above the display and at the bottom you'll find the home button with two capacitive Menu and Back keys on each side, which only light up when used. There's also a proximity sensor next to the earpiece to automatically turn off the display during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glossy back features the 5 megapixel camera lens, paired with a single LED flash and a loudspeaker grille. We did like the textured back panel of the original Galaxy Ace. The sequel has switched to glossy black plastic, which is the usual smudge magnet. There're no alternative color versions announced at this point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset features the power/lock button, in usual Samsung fashion. Some people may be used to having the sleep button up top, but the typical target should be brand-loyal upgraders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side has the volume rocker and a lanyard eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy Ace Plus is where the 3.5 mm headphones jack is placed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom there's a microphone pinhole and a microUSB port for both charging and computer connections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is powered by a 1300 mAh Li-Ion battery. A thorough battery test will have to wait till a full review. We'd just note at this point that the original Galaxy Ace has a 1350 mAh unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus has a traditional Samsung styling and reasonably solid build. it handles comfortably and we like the fact that it hasn't grown much in size despite having a bigger screen than the original. On the other hand, the bigger display is a questionable upgrade - it stretches the resolution without giving you much in return. Overall though, it's a decent experience for an LCD screen. One thing we're not impressed with at all is the glossy finish of the rear.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>TouchWiz UX 4.0 up front<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace Plus is running Gingerbread and has the latest version 4.0 of Samsung's custom TouchWiz launcher. The visually rich experience and extended functionality should be no news for users following Samsung and their Galaxy line. Of course, the company's high-end phones are about to move on to Ice Cream Sandwich but the Ace Plus has nothing to be ashamed of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a demo of the TouchWiz launcher on the Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The redesigned lockscreen of the Ace Plus has the usual integration of missed events but doesn't go further. There're no shortcuts to different apps on the lockscreen, as seen on recent HTC phones and the Huawei Honor, to name a few.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen accommodates plenty of widgets with lots of functionality. You can have up to 7 homescreen panes. A pinch zoom brings you to an aggregate view of all homescreen panes, which can be rearranged, deleted or added.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets, shortcuts or folders are pulled onto the homescreen from a drawer that appears at the bottom of the screen once you enter edit mode (press and hold on an empty spot or do Menu &gt; Add).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In typical TouchWiz fashion, there are four shortcuts docked at the bottom of the screen that are visible both on the homescreen and in the app launcher. The first three are user configurable (Phone, Contacts, Messaging), the fourth one being locked. It's the app drawer/home shortcut so it makes sense to always keep it in the same place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding widgets, shortcuts, folders or changing wallpapers is done by a context menu that pops up on demand from the bottom of the screen. You select a widget by swiping them left or right, enjoying a smooth animation throughout. You can also swipe each of the homescreen panes, which is a nice bonus functionality of TouchWiz 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app launcher is very similar to the homescreen - you can create folders to go with your shortcuts and you can add, remove and rearrange pages just like you would homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose List view instead of the regular grid view if you prefer. There's also a preview of all your app launcher screens for quicker browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has been slightly remodeled in TouchWiz 4.0, but there aren't any major changes to the functionality there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung Galaxy W I8150 you get a standard Android task switcher but with one modification - it has a button to launch a task manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom task manager, which Samsung have preinstalled, offers a lot of functionality. It also comes with a handy widget which shows you the number of active applications right on your homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the time, Android does really well when it comes to managing apps by itself (in fact, some claim that using a task manager is detrimental to the performance of a phone), so you would only need the task manager to occasionally kill a buggy app.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Speaking of performance it's time to put the Galaxy Ace Plus to the test. It's a step up from the original Galaxy Ace with a faster processor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The benchmark scores reflect the fact that this smartphone is only running a single core. Not that the Galaxy Ace Plus has anything to proove - it doesn't mind looking at the multiple-core beasts from a safe distance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a quick compare with the Galaxy Ace, which has an 800 MHz processor as opposed to the 1 GHz one of the Ace Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Galaxy Ace Plus is a solid performer nonetheless compared to other single core devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone didn't freeze or hang, and the general feel was fluid and responsive. A single core processor will be less capable when it comes to stuff like gaming. The Ace Plus supports Flash but embedded 720p videos were a no go.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus uses the standard Android gallery. The gallery automatically locates the images and videos no matter where they are stored. It even imports the online photos from your Google Picasa web albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Little about the Gallery should surprise you. It displays full resolution images and supports double tap and pinch zoom. It supports sharing images over Bluetooth, email, messaging along with uploading to Picasa or using DLNA to push the image to a compatible TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There're some basic editing options available right in the gallery: crops, 90-degree rotation and some more advanced features such as image adjustments, effects and selections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall it's a nice looking application and works really well with smooth zooming and flipping through images.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player offers a simple list-based interface. It displays all video files stored on the phone and you can sort them by name, date, type or size. The video player also remembers the last viewed position of the video, so you can resume exactly where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player lets you choose between three crop modes for how the video fits the screen. There's 5.1 channel virtualization and subtitle support. You can change font size and adjust subtitle sync (time them back or forth) but there's no option to manually load subtitles, they have to have the same filename as the video file to load.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We spare no praise for the rich codec support on Samsung droids, but the Galaxy Ace Plus is an unfortunate exception. Hardly a surprise either - the original Galaxy Ace was equally disappointing in this regard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DivX and XviD videos are not supported and even heavier mp4 videos of 720p resolution wouldn't play. We guess that has something to do with the Qualcomm-based chipset, which is rare enough on Galaxy devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus uses the standard TouchWiz music player. Samsung have enabled equalizer presets (including a custom one) along with the sound-enhancing DNSe technology and 5.1 channel virtualization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, tracks are sorted into four categories - All, Playlists, Albums and Artists. From the settings, you can add or remove filters to set up the music player just the way you like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The album art has a central place in the Now Playing interface, but you can replace it with an equalizer. You can skip songs or FF/rewind by sideways swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature allows you to quickly look up a song on YouTube or via Google search. The handset also prompts you to select whether to look up the artist, the song title or the album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you minimize the player you'll still get control over your music - it's displayed on the lockscreen and the notification area. It's a basic set of controls: play/pause and skip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace is also equipped with a stereo FM radio with RDS support. All it needs is a headphone set to be plugged in and you're good to go. Tuning into stations is easily done by two back and forth arrows. You can save frequencies, enable loudspeaker playback and more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus comes with a 5MP camera and a single LED flash. It captures photos at a maximum resolution of 2560 x 1920 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is the same as on previous Galaxy devices with two shortcut bars on each side of the viewfinder. On the right you get the still camera / camcorder switch, a virtual shutter key and the gallery shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left there's Scenes, flash on/off/auto, effects and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Ace Plus' image samples show a slight drop in quality compared to the Ace. They have less detail than the predecessor and color rendering is worse. There isn't much noise in the photos, but that's mostly down to to the aggressive noise reduction that tends to smear away some fine detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, it's a decent performer but probably middle of the 5 MP league.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Although the Galaxy Ace Plus has a 1 GHz processor, video recording is capped at VGA. This isn't much, considering 720p has become something of a given. But certainly better than the 15fps QVGA videos of the original Ace.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a video sample for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The interface of the Android web browser has hardly changed. Its user experience is, as always, flawless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser supports both double tap and pinch zooming along with the new two-finger tilt zoom. There are niceties such as multiple tabs, text reflow, and find on page. A neat trick is to pinch zoom out beyond the minimum - that opens up the tabs view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another neat trick is the browser-specific brightness setting. You can, for example, boost the brightness in the browser to comfortably view your web pages but keep the general brightness low to conserve battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Flash 11 support, which means you can watch YouTube videos right in the browser (videos up to 720p worked smoothly) and play Flash games too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While offering a fairly smooth Android experience, the Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus isn't terribly exciting. On a second thought, excitement doesn't probably rate as highly in the midrange as reliability and familiarity. The Plus is supposed to cater mostly to users who won't necessarily put hammer to the piggy to get themselves a smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyone coming from an entry-level smartphone can easily get on board with the Galaxy Ace Plus. We don't expect the price to be much of an issue, so even newcomers to the smartphone game could quickly come to grips with a package like the Ace Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Ace was a sound all-round performer for a sensible buck, leaving the Plus with a job to do. Upon a casual scan of the spec sheet, it doesn't come across as a massive upgrade but Samsung have done well to address some of the original's shortcomings. The Ace Plus has adequate inbuilt storage, the browser supports Flash and the video recording usable, at least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Add an up-to-date connectivity and software package with the latest TouchWiz and Gingerbread, and the Galaxy Ace Plus S7500 has more than enough to work with when introducing itself to future users.</paragraph>
