			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K610 is a new addition to the K-series but with a twist - it is one of the smallest mobile handsets available with 3G support and video calls. But if that is not enough, the mobile packs in a 2 megapixel camera and a Memory Stick Micro (M2) card slot. The classic shape and design would most probably appeal to the male audience, and one thing's for sure - you could always find place for this little fellow in your shirt's pocket.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Main advantages<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K610 is in the medium class of mobile phones and is aimed at people who need functionality and reliability at the same time from their phones - it's seems to us that it's targeted mainly at the office workers - it has a classic design, high-tech features, compact size and has everything that's necessary to back up your daily schedule. In fact, as regards to the functional characteristics of K610, it is fully identical to Sony Ericsson W710 with the added 3G features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The K610i version of the phone is to be sold in Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa. The other version K610c is for Mainland China. Recently, Sony Ericsson announced another new version of the phone to be manufactured - K610im which will be a black, i-mode version of K610. I-mode is a network operator service for direct handling of iMail, for browsing the Internet and viewing online content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we start, though, we should warn you that the phone we tested was a beta version so there are some bugs we found and we are more than sure that they would be fixed in the final version. We won't mention those as we go along the review though, because the bugs are a pretty common thing in a pre-release version.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As regards the retail package, the box should include a stereo headset, a USB cable and a 64MB Memory Stick Micro (M2) card along with a Memory Stick Duo Pro adapter but as we have always said - the contents of the retail package are market and country dependant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Size does matter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dimensions of the phone are pretty similar to those of K750 with a slight difference in the thickness and weight in K610's favor. The new 3G handset measures exactly 102 x 45.2 x 16.9 mm and weighs no more than 89 g without the memory card which puts it among the top five or so lightest 3G devices in our catalog. It has larger display than K750 with a diameter of 1.8" but unfortunately, uses the same resolution of 176 x 220 pixels. Make a note, though, with a thickness of 16.9 mm the phone is only 3 mm thicker than the famous Motorola V3 RAZR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The construction of the phone is very solid - so solid in fact, that it looks as though all the details and elements are etched into some uniform bar instead of put together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The test phone had a very nice matt silver finish which added to the overall "classic" looks of the phone. The keys themselves look as if they are made of the same material as the body which, of course, is highly unlikely but adds a great uniform feel to the design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  K610 general view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside to the phone is that it really didn't look as if it's an expensive device. Don't get us wrong, it doesn't look cheap or anything, it's just that it doesn't possess the flashiness of an expensive business or fashion phone. And it's not one of those, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not necessarily a drawback, however, since some people don't need a phone that makes a fashion statement and they usually look for a design as subtle as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is available in two color variants - one in red and the variant we got to test - the silver one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Exterior is well made<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The body of the phone is made out of plastic which has rather metallic looks which is something we liked. The main speaker is located at the top front part. The secondary VGA camera for video calls is slotted right next to it. The display is surrounded by a black frame and has mirror-like finish in order to improve legibility under direct sunlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Video calls camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the phone there is a music player shortcut key which is used for starting and stopping the music player when it's running in the background. On the right side of the phone we see the two traditional volume keys and a camera shortcut keys which is used both for starting the camera application and for taking pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top part there is only an on/off key which, when pressed briefly, opens up an additional menu that allows you to quickly lock the keypad, turn on the silent mode, change the current profile, or of course, shut down the phone. On the bottom side of the phone we see the regular Fast port for connecting the charger, the headphones or the USB cable, along with the microphone aperture and the neck strip eyelet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    K610 all over around</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now turning the phone around reveals the back panel which incorporates the loudspeaker, the self-portrait mirror and the camera lens. An interesting thing is the back cover which is really hard to slide out unless you press it on the right spot - the three dots. Now once we got the hang of it, we managed to access the 900 mAh Sony Ericsson BST-37 battery which according to the manufacturer should last for 2.4 hours of talking in 3G networks and 7 hours of talking in GSM networks. The video calling would drain the battery after 1 hour and 35 minutes, while no matter what the network is the phone should last 350 hours in stand-by. In reality, the phone lasted about 4 days and nights with about 10 minutes of talking a day in an area of strong network signal in a GSM-only network. Heavier usage should drain the battery quicker. Of course, those numbers are purely indicative since battery life depends heavily on the network specifics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    K610 back view ? battery and battery cover removed</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you remove the battery cover you gain access to the M2 memory card slot which is accessed from the right side when looking at the phone's back. The battery doesn't need to be removed in order to change cards. This is good since that Hot Swap functionality is becoming standard nowadays. The M2 memory cards are still quite unpopular. Much like the microSD cards, they are made for the mobile devices market for their small size and lower power consumption. The standard is used by Sony in most of its new range of portable products and as such it should pick up speed before the end of the summer. A good thing though that you get the Memory Stick Micro (M2) card with an adapter housing that allows you to plug it in every card reader device that supports Memory Stick Duo cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   K610 held in hand</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Getting to grips with it?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We are generally impressed by the ergonomics of the keypad. The only thing that required some time to get used to was the navigation D-pad that's less convenient than the conventional joystick used in most Sony Ericsson phones. Yes, we know that the Sony Ericsson joystick is prone to malfunction after the first year of usage, but regarding to their new phones, Sony Ericsson claim that they have improved the design of the infamous joystick. Given that, the joystick turns out to be a much better navigation solution. Of course, eventually you get used to the D-pad too, but we are left with the impression that you can hardly achieve the same operation speed seen in the joystick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The navigation D-pad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having said that, we must point out that the D-pad solution may be more well suited for the W-series music phones where the music player controls are assigned to the D-pad itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, besides the D-pad, we are delighted with the ergonomics of the other parts of the keypad. The alphanumeric keys are very well spaced, they are very easy to get used to and typing a SMS is a piece of cake. The design of the functional keys is also a great one - the two soft keys and the RETURN and CLEAR keys are made as rocker keys and we got to admit - it's a great solution. The two shortcut keys are embedded in the middle of the abovementioned rocker keys, but they can be hardly pressed by mistake - as opposed to those in K800. The right shortcut key opens the Activity menu, while the left one opens the NetFront web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The keypad: in daylight and in dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard backlighting is nicely blue and an interesting thing about it is that it makes some ripple effects when somebody is calling you or you receive a message. All keys are evenly lit with the exception of the two shortcut keys which happen to have no backlighting at all - quite a strange solution. But hey, as we said before, they are conveniently placed and they knob out a bit so they are easy to distinguish by touch.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Colors made bright<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone sports a 262K colors 1.8" TFD display. Now TFD technology is not something new and it's been around longer than TFT in fact. TFD (Thin Film Display) is very much like the TFT (Thin Film Transistor) since both technologies feature an active matrix of pixels. The TFD display though, has much lower power consumption - as low as the now obsolete STN displays which were used in the first days of the color mobile displays. The drawback of the TFD technology though, is that it's hard to get a color depth greater than 65K color with it. As already mentioned, K610 has a 262K colors display with the somewhat low resolution of 176 x 220 pixels. But given the right price tag, the display resolution might turn out to be just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> K610 display</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It does what it's made for<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>During the test period the K610 showed great signal reception both in GSM-only and in UMTS networks. The sound during calls is good and the microphone is pretty sensitive but nothing fancy. The loudspeaker is also loud enough - sorry, pun intended. The MP3 ringtones have the usual sound quality and you can hardly miss a call even in noisy city streets. The vibration is ok, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Making a call ? receiving a call</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Interior as good as exterior<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in K610 is a standard non-smartphone Sony Ericsson user interface. This is the reason why we would use some excerpts from our previous reviews of Sony Ericsson phones. Of course, we would use the screenshots from K610 for illustration and the text would take into account all the interface specifics of this model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In active stand-by mode the screen displays information about the network signal, battery strength, current date and time, plus the next alarm that's due to go off. You can choose to display the clock with large semi-transparent numbers which take up half the screen but blend with the chosen wallpaper very well as long it's a dark one. The numbers are almost invisible on light-colored wallpapers. A good thing is that you can set the clock to be seen in the upper right angle of the screen even while browsing through the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the navigation D-pad in any of the four directions can start a given feature or application according to the user preference. In fact when you start using the phone for the first time, the phone reminds you of that option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Stand-by screen ? create shortcuts to the D-pad's four ways</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu itself is made of a matrix grid with 4 x 3 animated and zooming-in icons. All sub-menus are in listed view with tiny icons on the left side. The phone reacts and performs fast in every submenu and application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The main menu ? a listed sub menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several repetitions of applications and shortcuts in the menus, which can be confusing for some users. The test phone had only one preinstalled graphic theme but of course there are more available online. The themes change the color scheme, the wallpaper and supposedly, the menu icons. According to us the default theme is rather irritating. We have seen a version of the phone with a dark purple graphic theme which suited it far better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the things, that have been developed a lot, is the Activity menu which has a dedicated shortcut key on the keypad. The Now running tab of the menu offers real multi-tasking. In K750 you could only run simultaneously one regular application and one Java application, for example. Now you can run three Java applications in the same time which allows for a lot more freedom and flexibility in everyday usage. You can always open the browser, open an instant messenger client, listen to the radio and play a game, all at the same time. That's a great functionality that is not seen in other non-OS phones of other manufacturers. The rest of the functionality of the Activity menu has remained the same - it offers quick access to recent events, the web menu with integrated Google search and the My Shortcuts menu which contains a list of frequently used features and can be modified to the user preference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The Running applications tab of the Activity menu</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebooking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface is simple and easy to use. As always, the phonebook asks you whether you would like to copy your contacts from the SIM card to the phone's memory. However you can choose either the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be the default for the phonebook. Both lists cannot be displayed simultaneously. Otherwise, a nice option is that you can make the phone to autosave in the SIM card any new contacts that you save in the phone's memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Choosing default contacts ? browsing the phonebook with SIM contacts </paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between different phone numbers and emails for a given contact is possible via pushing the side ways of the joystick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum capacity of the phonebook is 1000 contacts but you can save up to 2500 phone numbers. Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. Contacts are searched by gradual typing of the desired name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact, there are five possibilities for the phone number: Mobile, Home, Work, Fax and Other. This is the first tab of fields for the new contacts. The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture and a custom ringtone. The fourth goes for Title, Company, Street, City, State, ZIP, Country information. The last, fifth tab, is for additional information and birth date. When you add the birth date, the phone asks you whether you would like to add it to the calendar and put a reminder of it. That's a good feature and we like it that we see it available more and more often in current phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Contact details</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Calls made simple<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls log is divided in four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. The tabs altogether contain up to 30 call records, which are shared between the separate tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Calls log</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Trash the typewriter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All messages, except emails, use one Inbox. No matter what kind of message has been received, it goes to the common Inbox. Only email messages have their own separate Inbox. There is a My Friends feature which works like an instant messaging application and can be used if your network operator supports it. The phone also offers a RSS feeds reader that in fact uses the NetFront web browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Messaging menu </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start typing a message, first you must choose from the three variants: Text message, Picture message or Voice message. There is no point in that as you can easily transform a SMS into a MMS along the way by simply attaching multimedia objects to the message. The editor shows up to 5 lines en bloc. There is a character counter which activates when you reach 20 characters before the 160 limit. When you pass the limit a "2 SMS" warning sign comes up for a second to alert you that the message will be divided in two parts. Of course, there is the T9 dictionary to assist the typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Write new ? typing a SMS ? exiting from the message editor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports POP3 and IMAP protocols. It can also manage several accounts simultaneously. You can choose from downloading only headers or headers and text. There are many options available for the check interval, you can set it to check from every 5 minutes to 12 hours or disable the automatic check at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Reading your welcome email</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music all over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson K610 supports MP3, WAV, MP4, AAC, AMR, MIDI file formats. The media player has an equalizer with several options and can manage Playlists. It also plays both music and video files. It can be set to run in background so you can do other things with the phone while listening to music. Unfortunately, when in background mode, there is no indication of the name of the song and artist of the track currently playing. Otherwise, the control of the player is intuitive, it can be controlled via the navigation D-pad and that makes it really easy. The player is identical to the one seen in W-series music phones, and Sony Ericsson claim that the final version of the phone would include the MegaBass® equalizer preset which is a Walkman trademark. Unfortunately, our test phone didn't have such an equalizer preset. Generally speaking, the player has the same functionality as the first generation of Walkman phones - similar to the one of W810, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Media player options ? playing a song ? equalizer</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management at your fingertips<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you have used other Sony Ericsson handsets you won't be surprised by the K610 file manager because there are no significant improvements here. On the other hand if you are still new to SE phones, well let me tell you that they have one of the best non-OS file managers. It allows you to mark files (single or multiple), copy them, move them, and also create and delete folders as you please. There are three tabs of file lists - one for the phone memory files, one for the memory stick files and one mutual for all files. By selecting a given tab you can filter the file list you wish to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Different file manager tabs ? no M2 card present here</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing your pictures is as easy as ever - you could do that as a list with or without thumbnails while the file names are visible. You can also choose to view your pictures as a grid matrix of thumbnails in 2 x 2 or 3 x 3 grids with no file names visible. The video files can also be browsed as thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    List view ? thumbnails list view ? 2 x 2 grid view? 3 x 3 grid view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can view the pictures themselves vertically (in portrait mode) just as you would on a normal phone or horizontally (in landscape mode) if you prefer. The landscape mode allows for more details since most of the pictures are shot in a landscape aspect ratio and they fit better in a landscape screen. When viewing the pictures one by one the phone downsamples them and preloads the images in order to allow you fast browsing. By downsampling we mean that it displays them with a much lower quality than normally. Once you find a picture you would like to see in its full glory you should stop browsing for a second and the phone would load it with its normal quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Viewing the pictures in landscape mode is much more natural</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even more, up to 32x. Zooming is performed by small incrementing steps. That allows greater control but is kind of irritating since you have to go through several stages before you zoom in to the actual size of the picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Zooming in: 2x; 4x; 16x; 32x</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new thing about the file browser is the Timeline view which allows you to filter the pictures according to the month they have been taken in. After you specify the month, you could even choose the exact date. It's that sort of image filtering that is offered by computer picture browsers. The Timeline sorting will be seen more and more often in the K-series of mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Applying a monthly filter ? applying a daily filter after that</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A snapshot or two<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 2 megapixel camera of K610 does its job satisfactory without any bells and whistles. We've seen better quality cameras from Sony Ericsson, not to mention the lack of autofocus or a LED flash. The camera offers night mode, self-timer, panorama, frames, and burst shooting modes. It also features white balance correction. Several color effects are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     View finder ? some menu options ? Blog this on Blogger.com!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shooting is performed in landscape mode by using the camera shortcut button as a shutter key. You can, of course, take a picture in portrait mode too, but the camera menu is meant to be used in landscape mode. Once you've taken a picture with the phone you can immediately blog it on the Internet and thus share it with your friends. The camera options are in a menu that we have seen on all recent phones by Sony Ericsson so if you've had one, you would feel perfectly at home here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In good light conditions the camera performs well enough. The colors are oversaturated, which makes them pleasant for the eye, but are definitely not natural. Also, it seems that Sony Ericsson are experimenting with new noise reduction routines in this model - the noise is indeed low in good light (look at the sky), but this comes at a price - the fine detail is lost in some cases (look at the foliage).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>        Sony Ericsson K610 samples in full resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In low light the results are plain horrible. Instead the grain we've used to see in most phones under low light conditions, we see here blotches of color noise, which are a lot more unpleasant to the eye and also harder to fix with noise reduction software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson has no dedicated macro mode, everything closer than say 80 cm from the lens will be out of focus (look at the roses for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The auto white balance is not always reliable ? forget about shooting macros</paragraph>
			<paragraph>            K610 pictures resampled to 1024 x 768 pixels</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos taken with K610 are captured at a low QCIF resolution. You can choose if you would like to limit the video duration in order to fit it on a MMS message or whether you would like to make unlimited recordings. The options for the video camera are pretty much the same as those for the still camera with very minor differences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Video viewfinder ? choosing the video files length</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Video samples</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should also mention the video calls camera on the front of K610 since after all we are reviewing a 3G phone here that is capable of making video calls. We are pleasantly surprised by the functionality that this tiny VGA camera offers. The other party's video feed is viewed in a large frame in the middle of the screen while you see your own image in the very same time in a small frame in the lower left corner. There is also a possibility to view your own image mirror-like, meaning that the image gets reversed and looks as if you are staring at yourself in a mirror. It's much more natural that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also digitally zoom your image at a 2x degree or choose to replace your live video feed with a picture of your taste or with a live feed from the main camera. You can also do that during an actual video call. The options don't end here. You can further on control the exposure compensation of the camera or even switch it into a night mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 3 different video quality modes: Smooth, Sharp and Normal. Smooth delivers a smoother picture flow while Sharp provides more detailed images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Regular setup ? replacing the two pictures ? live feed from the main camera</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Plugged and unplugged<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides 3G and GPRS for fast data transfers, video calls and streaming content support, the handset offers the usual connectivity capabilities such as the USB support and the Infrared port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we tested, the integrated HTML Access NetFront Internet browser is at a good level and it does its job more than all right. It has a lot of options - you can view the pages fullscreen with no menus showing and you can even browse your Web pages in landscape mode. It has WAP and picture modes. It supports content created for HTML 4.01, xHTML 1.0, CSS and Java script, WAP 2.0. The supported security protocols are SSL/TLS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regrettably, the display does not allow exploring the full abilities of the browser. Generally, the Smart-fit function of the browser manages well with fitting the web content into the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    NetFront web browser</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset supports Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP profile which means that you could use a stereo Bluetooth headset with it and that is something you don't see in every phone nowadays. Another notable thing about the excellent Bluetooth support is the Human Interface Device (HID) profile which allows the phone to be used as a remote control for PC and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Further on, the phone could be used as a Bluetooth modem for Internet access of a PC or a mobile computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has support for local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC while the remote synchronization is with remote servers. The USB connectivity of the phone has two modes - one for file transfers and one for USB Internet or to put it simply - the second one is for using the phone as a modem. A great feature that we see in every new Sony Ericsson phone nowadays is the capability to update the firmware version of the phone over-the-air, meaning you can download the new version through the phone itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Doing your business<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This phone offers many time organizing features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Alarms, Calculator, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Applications and Code memo. The Calendar offers monthly and weekly view. As we have mentioned above, when you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone asks you if you wish to add it in the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Organizer menu ? Calendar monthly view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Reminders can be put as Subjects. Notes are written as messages; there even is the T9 to assist writing. There are five alarms available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat it on chosen days of the week or everyday. Furthermore, you can add text and a picture to the alarm as well as set its behavior in case the time that the alarm is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Alarms menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the applications are concerned, an interesting and funny one is the FaceWarp application which is used for manipulating portrait shots by adding funny faces and grimaces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Our friend Dexter in FaceWarp: boring, bigface, professor</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications include Video DJ, Photo DJ and Music DJ, Remote Control and Voice Recorder. Video DJ is for making video clips from scratch using special transition effects and even by adding background music. It's a very amusing application. Photo DJ is for editing images and by the way offers some rich features and Music DJ is a very simple application for creating polyphonic melodies. The Remote Control application is for controlling a PC via Bluetooth. The Voice Recorder allows unlimited recording.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>To play or not to play<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is one preinstalled game on the phone: QuadraPop. It's a Tetris-like game which can be rather amusing if you are in the right mood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  QuadraPop</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words...<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This phone managed to impress us with its user-friendliness. It's nothing flashy in looks but it's a work horse you can rely on without being too business orientated. The 3G and video call functionality along with the 2 megapixel camera and M2 memory card slot, all housed in a rather small package, make us think that if reasonably priced, the phone should become a market success. One can rarely see such a combination of extreme ease of use, fast interface response, a great web browser, wide connectivity options, and good battery life in such a small-sized bar shape phone. All that, along with the phone's classic design and looks, would surely provide its success in the battle for customers.</paragraph>
