			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At first, you might think that the Sony Ericsson C901 is just another 5-megapixel cameraphone. Well, that?s not terribly exciting in the current market bustling with 8-megapixel snappers, and probing the boundaries at 12. But you?d be wrong. Be it for the simple reason that the C901 is one of the few handsets out there sporting a Xenon flash. And the one on the C901 is special enough to help it stand above the crowd of cameraphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing to note is the eco-friendly GreenHeart version which - interestingly enough - is the only C901 flavor currently available on the Sony Ericsson website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C901 GreenHeart is trendy for being partially made of recycled materials (though, technically both devices are identical). You can find out more about it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even after reading those lines many would say there is nothing so special about the C901, particularly as it?s not even selling worldwide! Well, we?ve been inundated with requests that we review it and there?s nothing we like doing more than pleasing our loyal readers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 is a great value in terms of image quality. Looking at the pictures we took with it makes us nostalgic for the time when Sony Ericsson camerphones set the pace and the others just followed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the remarkable imaging though, the C901 is just an ordinary feature phone. And that isn?t a bad thing, since it does its job just fine. Very little to complain about, but at the same time not a huge list of features to get excited about either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyhow, it?s about time we opened the box and started the review, don?t you think? Head for the next page to see what we found in the box and what we thought of the Sony Ericsson C901 design and construction.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing: few things in a small box<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We realize that the C901 is not a high-end phone but it?s not among the cheapest in its class either, so we were quite let down by the small box that had almost nothing besides the phone. Prepare yourself for one of our shortest unboxings yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the handset you get a wall charger, user guide and a rather basic pair of earphones. OK, the Sony Ericsson C901 isn?t about music but given its nice audio quality (as tested) and the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack, it would?ve been nice of Sony Ericsson to throw in at least an adapter to make up for the supplied earphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the box contains? nothing else. That?s all. No memory card, no data cable, no software CD. Nada!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The eco-friendly variant Sony Ericsson C901 GreenHeart comes with an electronic in-phone manual to replace the standard paper version, saving over 90 percent of paper used in the retail packaging. And its box is even smaller as well to minimize the environmental impact of transporting the final product.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the Sony Ericsson C901 GreenHeart you also get a greener MH300 headset, which is made from 100 percent recycled plastic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson C901 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 is a compact candybar measuring only 105 x 45 x 13 mm. That makes is small enough to fit in any shirt pocket or purse. Despite the small size and weight (just 107 grams), due to its high quality materials it feels quite robust to hold.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 is entirely made of matt plastic which look and feel good. It may not look as sleek as piano black but at least it?s not a fingerprint magnet. The lens cover looks way better but that?s something we?ll discuss in a little while.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the standard edition C901 is available in three color versions (Noble Black, Sincere Silver and Precious Peach), the C901 GreenHeart is only sold in Ocean White color (the paint is waterborne). But don?t go rushing to your local store just yet ? the C901 availability is a tricky question as it?s only sold in selected markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 employs a 2.2" 256K-color TFT display of QVGA resolution. What we couldn?t miss noticing is the superb clarity and contrast. Sunlight legibility is excellent, even under direct sunlight. We have no problems with either reading or typing using both dark and light themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And above the screen we find the centrally positioned earpiece and the ambient light sensor on its left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath are the standard 6 control keys (two soft keys, Activity Menu and Clear buttons and Call/End keys) and the D-pad in-between. Their design and positioning are pretty standard for Sony Ericsson, but since the handset itself is quite small there isn?t enough space for all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The designers have tried to solve that problem by playing with their form. Well, we?re not sure whether it was the idea or the implementation that was to blame but the result is the same ? cramped, uncomfortable keys (especially the two soft keys). Luckily, the D-pad is very comfy so browsing the menu is zippy enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In camera mode, the D-pad gets some extra functionality and imaging-related controls are backlit in blue. The Up and Down keys on the D-pad are assigned to control brightness. Some of the alphanumeric buttons are involved as well, namely the 3, 6, 9 and the # keys. These are used to change the shooting and scene mode, as well as turn the self-timer and the inbuilt xenon flash on and off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad is made of the same rubber-like plastic used for the controls and the D-pad. They are big enough and mistyping is not an issue. Key presses involve a distinct click and typing is quick and easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The soft white keypad backlighting is strong and even. The D-pad backlighting has a bluish tint - an almost inevitable spillover from the alternative blue illumination in camera mode. The controls on the sides of the D-pad are lit in a soft, even white.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson C901 features nothing but the lanyard eyelet and the regular Fast Port - unfortunately, but quite expectedly, it doesn't have any protective cover to conceal the connectors and keep dust away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset is the top side in digicam terms. It hosts the slightly elevated volume rocker - which doubles as a zoom lever when taking or browsing pictures - and all the camera controls. The two-step shutter key is also there and is positioned very comfortably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Halfway up the right side there are another couple of camera controls which are laid out similar to the volume rocker key. They are the dedicated camera mode switch and the Gallery button.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>noTitleParsed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The top part of the phone hosts only the battery cover latch which works just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most distinctive part of this phone is the back. The camera lens and Xenon flash are revealed by sliding the dedicated cover. Sliding is very smooth and solid, and it immediately starts the camera. There is a slight resistance when starting to slide the active cover, but after the mid-point it goes all the way almost automatically. Thumbs up for both looks and handling here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The loudspeaker grill lies almost unnoticeable just above the Sony Ericsson logo on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover (using the latch on top) unveils the standard Sony Ericsson BST-33 Li-Po battery with a capacity of 950 mAh. The same unit is widely used across a range of Sony Ericsson handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The manufacturer claims the battery should provide up to 430 hours of standby and up to 9.5 hours of talk time in a GSM-only network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, battery life ranged over two to five days on a single charge, depending mainly on multimedia usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also under the battery cover is the M2 memory card slot. It is hot-swappable, you just have to remove the back cover to access it. There is no eject mechanism so you?d better have some strong nails when trying to pull out the card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 is a sleek and compact bar. Those few handling issues we mentioned a few lines back aren?t a deal breaker and when it comes to shooting images (one of C901?s main tasks), the ergonomics come into their own .</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: no news is sometimes good news<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The C901 interface is the regular Sony Ericsson feature phone UI that is used in most of their top handsets. To put it bluntly, the C901 offers nothing more than a few cosmetic tweaks over the elderly C902 - except for the addition of threaded messaging of course. It's also true though that it doesn't fall short of the Cyber-shot top dog, the C905.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with information on top indicating signal strength, currently used data carrier and battery status. At the bottom of the display, just above the context keys are their labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard foursome - theme-dependent, 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating view features three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden, just as an indication of what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar featuring tiny icons for the other main menu entries. Neither of those view modes works with shortcut keys. Only the Grid view allows quick numeric keypad access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can minimize the progress indicator when receiving a file over Bluetooth but you can't do that when sending a file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode can only work with a SIM card in the device and requires a restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is visually appealing and snappy. Auto rotation is enabled in the Media Center and is generally quite responsive. There's a barely noticeable lag involved but we guess that's to be preferred over an over-sensitive accelerometer that can often play up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C901 supports Flash Lite themes, which change the color scheme and wallpaper. Our handset has four themes preinstalled: Clarity, Cyber-shot, Peach, and Wink. The Cyber-shot theme was the most interesting one and is actually a slideshow of multiple preloaded images displayed on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson handsets also come with a handy option for their wallpaper - you can use an application as a background instead of an actual image. Of course you can't just use any application - the choice is currently limited to a few apps. These are WalkMate, Standby World Clock 3D, Slideshow Wall and PIM Wallpaper. The step counting WalkMate and the PIM Wallpaper are probably the only practical apps among them.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Traditional phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way you can set up the phone to autosave to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up your contacts list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact employs a tabbed interface that?s well known for anyone that has used a Sony Ericsson handset in the past couple of years. There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and finally the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you can add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of the contact is written in only one field, but you still have the option to order contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and it does it very well. Naturally, you can search through the contacts list by gradual typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling of calls is excellent and we didn't experience any voice quality or reception problems with the Sony Ericsson C901. Call clarity is great in both the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C901 offers videocall functionality, but since there is no front-facing videocall camera, it's more like videocall sharing - meaning that you can see the other party on your display but you can only share what your primary camera "sees".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing or ?Smart Search? as Sony Ericsson call it, is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed Call Log application should be familiar too if you've used a fairly recent Sony Ericsson handset. It displays in four tabs, including All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to or from a single contact, only the last one gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While conducting our traditional speakerphone test with Sony Ericsson C901 we discovered some new ringtones preloaded, which we really enjoyed. However, the maximum volume was a bit disappointing and the device scored average. Here is how it compares to some of the other handsets we have tested. You can find information on the actual testing process, along with the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging sports threaded view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical for the latest Sony Ericsson phones, the C901 sports the threaded messages view. SMS to and from a certain contact is organized in speech bubbles much like in an instant messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between the conversation-style layout and the regular Inbox is only a matter of toggling a tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting fact is that if you get a reply while you're still in the thread, it will be automatically added to the conversation, instead of appearing as an alert on the home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson C901 offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts and the option to assign categories to messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manage Messages application enhances message handling. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact. Categories also allow quick and comfortable sorting of messages with separate folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a rich T9 dictionary. The SMS and MMS messages share an editor; when typing SMS you can easily convert it into an MMS via the options menu or using the attach-stuff toolbar below the text box to insert images, animations, videos or sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone automatically downloaded the settings for our Gmail account. The options to view messages full screen and change font size really helped get a lot of text on the screen. Even at the smallest font setting text remained legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email you get the Manage Email feature, which has the same functionality as the one for text messages. Saving attachments is problem-free, even if the phone doesn't recognize the file type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Sony Ericsson C901 (much like all other Sony Ericsson feature phones) can't preview any documents including the ones attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of any document reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>The Media Center remains untouched<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C901 runs the flash-based Media Center. Its menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, Games, RSS feeds and Settings icons. The settings menu is simple - you may opt for portrait, landscape or auto-rotate modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Player to be found in C901 is version 3.0 - a slightly abridged edition of Walkman player 3.0. Across the Media Center menus, you can enjoy screen auto-rotation. The player supports numerous file formats, including the regularly used MP3, WAV, WMA, M4A and E-AAC plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening. The player can naturally be set to run in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface colors of the Media center vary across different themes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in the media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, and the interface is simple and stylish. The video files are accessible via the file manager too. Other extras include fullscreen mode and screenshot capability, and you also have the option to save a frame of video and add it to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no XviD or DivX support of course, but according to Sony Ericsson, their MediaGo desktop software is enough to transfer any video from the desktop computer to the handset in the correct format and resolution to be played on the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Our review of the desktop application proved it does its job alright, but there's still more to wish for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to our C901 now, the Media center video section also houses the pre-installed YouTube client. It gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarked favorites and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image gallery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery stores the shots you've taken, along with prebundled or uploaded images, and offers some extra options like mark as favorite and photo feed. Latest Photo provides quick access to the most recent photos. Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year and when a month is open, it reveals a 3 x 4 grid of photo thumbs. Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the corresponding month with the highlighted photo slightly enlarged for better viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures section again opens as a 3 x 4 grid of thumbs with non-camera images such as the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the fullscreen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Photo gallery is a richly-featured tool for managing your photo collection and it offers very good customization capabilities. Photo Tags displays previously marked favorite photos. The sending options include Send as Picture Msg, as Email, to Blog, via Bluetooth or even to Facebook. Uploading to Facebook is quite straightforward in 3 easy steps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, you can set a photo as wallpaper, screen saver, startup screen, and contact picture straight from the gallery. The well known Pan and Zoom and slideshow features are also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the C901 is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images using Cell-ID. When browsing tagged images in the gallery, the View-on-map option displays the location where the picture was taken directly on the preinstalled Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, picture browsing via the classic file manager is still possible, but we are sure only a few users will make use of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PhotoDJ, VideoDJ and MusicDJ are signature features for all Sony Ericsson phones, and are available here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of the picture or even beyond, yet extreme zooming won't really do any good. Browsing 5 megapixel images didn't involve any lag at all, while zooming does take a little time. The magnified section of the image preloads in low quality and only appears in full res after a couple of seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is a mixed bag<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of the C901 is just about the same as its mid-range Sony Ericsson siblings we have tested recently. The handset achieved excellent scores on most readings but a disastrous frequency response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response deviates severely from the textbook rules. It has extremely boosted bass and treble and reduced mid frequency sounds. The graph looks as if an equalizer has been applied only that it wasn't. We can hardly imagine how far off the frequency response would be if you actually apply one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side all of the other readings are pretty good with the distortion levels simply great. The stereo crosstalk, the noise level and the dynamic range are also nothing short of excellent. You can see for yourselves that save for the frequency response the Sony Ericsson C901 is quite a gifted musician. You can also notice its resemblance to some of the other Sony Ericsson handsets we have tested recently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson C901 frequency response is pretty disastrous</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more info about the testing procedure and more results here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of Sony Ericsson C901 has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has a nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player but offers none of the fancy fullscreen graphics the player does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is accessible through its original location in the entertainment menu. The service interface comes with the same expanded features that we first saw on C902 - "Find similar music", "Send music info via SMS", "TrackID charts" and a very extensive "Artist info" section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID also offers the online search option. It allows fast search in the entire database for artist, album, title, and lyrics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent 5 megapixel shooter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you should already know by now, the Sony Ericsson C901 has a 5 megapixel camera capable of producing images with a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. The handset is equipped with a xenon flash and a LED one to assist auto-focusing in poor light conditions. The xenon flash is strong enough and definitely saves the day in poor and no-light conditions. But we will talk about that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel autofocus camera offers a wide range of niceties such as smile shutter, face detection, BestPic, auto-rotate, macro mode, spot metering, image geo-tagging, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has the familiar user interface. Its pop-up sub-menus enhanced with icons and the Multi Menu packing all the available settings are here to facilitate the user.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera toolbar gives access to shoot mode, scenes, picture size, focus, flash, self-timer, metering mode, white balance, effects, and settings Multi Menu. An ISO setting is not available in the C901.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus mode has an extra feature - Face detection. The face recognition system allows you to simultaneously track as many as 3 faces but focus is locked on the one that's closest to the center of the frame when the image is captured.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shoot mode menu has five modes, two of which deserve special attention - the well known BestPic and a feature introduced to the market for the first time by Sony Ericsson in the C905 via a firmware update - Smile Shutter mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using Smile Shutter is easy - first you fully press the camera key all the way down to activate it. A small blinking yellow icon in the right upper corner indicates that the mode is on and the phone will automatically snap the photo as soon as it "spots" a grinning face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ultra quick-snapping BestPic mode has two varieties - fast and slow. In fast mode it produces 9 full-size 5 megapixel images in about 2sec, each of them of approximately 1MB of size. The slow mode takes 9 images again but at a larger interval of about 3.5 sec. Unfortunately in the BestPic mode none of the flashes are available for use. It's understandable for the xenon, because it couldn't recharge so fast, but there is no explanation for the LED. It definitely would be nice if we could use it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images thanks to the Cell-ID feature. You can enable geotagging (Add position) from the settings to add GPS location data to your pictures. A flag icon at the bottom of the viewfinder indicates that the option is activated. Remember that the Cell-ID geotagging will more probably cause small amount of data traffic to be generated on your monthly bill.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated macro mode in the C901 allows you to take images from as close as 10 cm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer the camera is also able to auto-rotate your images when you are previewing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one shortcoming that concerns the one-way camera menu layout - to reach the Multi Menu you have to pass all the other settings on the toolbar as it's the last item there. Browsing items on the toolbar from the opposite end should be an option, as with the camera interfaces of competing brands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 camera is a really capable shooter. The C901 image quality is very good, easily ranking among the best 5 megapixel cameraphones on the market. The photos have pleasing colors and good contrast with the noise levels well under control. The amount of resolved detail is one of the best from the 5 megapixel lineup and almost matches the current leader - the Nokia 6700 classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some places where the noise levels can go a bit high, but thankfully it's rare enough. The processing algorithm must have been upgraded since the last Cybershots. You can see for yourself from the samples below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The xenon flash performance is almost on par with the Sony Ericsson C905's xenon, but the produced images are a bit softer than those taken with the C905 in pitch dark conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Sony Ericsson C901. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 is quite close to Nokia 6700 classic performance in both resolved detail and noise reduction algorithm. That again goes to confirm that what we have on our hands here is one of the best 5 MP shooters we have ever seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the C901 is also capable of capturing video, even if it's limited to QVGA resolution at 30fps. You can use the LED flash in the video recording. The clips are recorded in mp4 format and take about 3 MB for every minute of recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mid-range connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 is not an internet-centric device and scores modestly on connectivity options. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G are all on board for worldwide roaming. 3.6 Mbps HSDPA, as well as HSUPA are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, the Sony Ericsson C901 offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options. There is also support for the A2DP profile allowing you to listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset. Last but not least, there is also the M2 card slot (under the battery cover), which is often one of the quickest ways of transferring data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The C901 supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. Unfortunately there is no USB cable bundled in the package and you will need to buy one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no premium connectivity options such as Wi-Fi, GPS or even a 3.5 mm audio jack, but we did not expect them since the C901 is a pure camera-oriented phone at a (relatively) bargain price.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good browsing experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C901 has an Access NetFront browser v3.4 featuring the extended home screen, also available in C903, C905, T700 and G705. Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen, right under a search and an address bar. They grant access to free content, such as clips, tracks and games on the Sony Ericsson site, including a step-by-step guide for setting up email accounts or internet connections. The appearance of the home screen changes to a different bright color each time you start the browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elaborate web pages are rendered well and there are lots of configurable settings too. The dedicated full screen mode in portrait mode is replaced by the auto-rotate feature, which actually opens it in full-screen landscape mode. View modes include Text only, Pan and Zoom, and Zoom page. The Panning/scrolling speed is up to standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer, which is nice to work with. Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option. It searches the loaded web page but the first match is not immediately listed and you need to press the find key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If are still not satisfied with this browser, you can always count on the superb (and free) OperaMini as a suitable replacement.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 offers a wide range of time-management features. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar. The to-do application allows storing of two types of tasks: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages and the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms are part of the main menu and there are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm's behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson one. It offers the basic functions, no bells and whistles, but you can run the Converter from there. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the familiar basic applications. The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the available free memory the only restriction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the additional applications, Sony Ericsson C901 comes with AccuWeather, Facebook, YouTube, Standby World 3D, Photo Mate, PIM Wallpaper, Slideshow Wall, World Clock 3D and Walk Mate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo Mate offers help and practical tips for getting the most out of your camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Slideshow Wall is a simple application that displays the available images with a few animations. The main purpose of this application is that it can be used as a wallpaper, otherwise it would've been pretty useless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walk Mate is a simple step counter application which works in background mode getting its data from the built-in accelerometer. Again, it can be used as homescreen wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AccuWeather application gives you up-to-date weather information for locations of interest. Current conditions overview and a three day forecast is available for a great number of cities around the world. You should bear in mind that the data is downloaded in real time so data charges may apply. Not that we can think of any other way for the application to work but we still feel a warning is due.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Standby World 3D is a nice application with readings for up to three different time zones around the world. The background changes as day turns into night in the selected locations. You can set this app as a default background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PIM Wallpaper is an app showing your appointments for the next two days in a rather boring grey layout. But it can be set as a default wallpaper, which some of you may find useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook application lets you log on to Facebook and see the latest news about your friends or change your status. You can't do much more than that but still it does the basic job. If you minimize the app your online friends will appear on the homescreen with small thumbs and bubbles for their current moods. It's a very fancy option in fact: all the thumbs are semi-transparent and switch from one to another every 3 seconds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, World Clock 3D allows you to spin the globe searching for a time zone. You can zoom in and out as you please. Of course you can also search by city name.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Six games onboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C901 comes with six full Java games preinstalled: Bowling, Brain Challenge, Brick Breaker, Bubble Town, Kasparov Chess and Sudoku.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bowling is a small but real cool game using the motion sensor. Choose your position, direction and then swing with your hand and watch what happens. It's great fun and you can play in tournaments against your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next one is Bubble Town. It's a simple bubble breaking game that involves shooting colored balls and forming three or more identical bubble combinations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Brain Challenge is quite an entertaining game that involves solving mathematical problems, memory games and pattern recognition exercises.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Kasparov Chess doesn't need any explanation - it's a standard chess game named after the famous Russian chess player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Brick Breaker is a replica of an arcade classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last game is a Java interpretation of the world-popular Japanese game Sudoku. It's got a nice interface and enough difficulty levels to suit every taste.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 is not the usual mobile phone we meet these days. This review doesn't come in the nick of time really but the C901 might as well be quite on track to give the Cybershot line a well-deserved boost before the likes of Satio and Aino prepare to steal the show. Pet names are all the rage now in the Sony Ericsson portfolio, but a bit of old-school charm and skill turned out quite refreshing. And the conventional model name is by far not the only thing that makes the Sony Ericsson C901 a Cybershot classic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Packing all of the standard mid-range features is unlikely to make it stand out, but the unusual camera certainly does. The surprisingly good processing algorithm topped with xenon flash and active camera lens cover bring out the best out of the Cybershot family. The Sony Ericsson feature phone UI combined with the Flash Media Center hasn't change a bit, but still it managed to please us with its vivid colors and nice animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First in line for shoppers to consider are its siblings the Sony Ericsson C902 and W902. Both match the price tag on the C901 and their cameras are similar, but crucially lack the xenon flash, meaning that they fail to deliver the level of versatility offered by the C901.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson C902 ? Sony Ericsson W902</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For 70 euro more you can already get the Cybershot C905, which is ageing and getting cheaper. This 8 megapixel snapper comes equipped with xenon flash along with all the other high-end stuff like Wi-Fi, GPS, bigger screen, etc. We agree, the price is really not so close, but it's still quite a bargain.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson C905</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7220 Ultra b matches most of the key features of the C901, but can offer even more - a document viewer and GPS. However, it does lack the xenon flash. With a distinct and bold styling, the Samsung bar is certainly a worthy rival.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S7220 Ultra b</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6700 classic is definitely worth your time too. It's among the best 5 megapixel phones we have ever seen. And a cool looking handset too. For 40 euro more than C901 you get amazing photo quality and a built-in GPS with Nokia Maps though running on the now dated S40 UI. Again if you can live without the flash, it's worth checking out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia 6700 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Exactly the same price tag still sticks on the Cybershot K850 and the fashionable Samsung F480 Tocco. The first one comes with similar camera and hardware features, but handily offers microSD compatibility along with the in-house M2 slot. The F480 is part of the Samsung fashion line and also matches the C901 spec sheet, and even adds a 2.8" touchscreen. It has no xenon flash though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson K850 ? Samsung F480 Tocco</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surely the Nokia 6220 classic deserves special attention for its similar camera with xenon flash, which did quite well in terms of photo quality. Even more, the 6220 is already a few bucks cheaper, but comes with a better display, a videocall camera, GPS and TV-out along with a 3.5mm audio jack. The camera is equipped with Carl Zeiss optics and captures VGA videos @30 fps. Not least, the Nokia 6220 classic is a Symbian powered smartphone and we believe the comparison is slightly in favor of the Finns. Still the Sony Ericsson C901 speaks design more fluently and offers an extra LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similar is the situation with the Nokia N82, which was the all-reigning imaging champion back in its day. It's got the smart skills with Symbian and all the modern connectivity options such as Wi-Fi and GPS. But we have to admit its design is quite dated now, the phone is relatively bulky and it seems quite overpriced for a device of that age - it still goes around 240 euro, you know.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Last in line is the Motorola ZN5. The 5 megapixel bar boasts a Kodak sensor and comes with xenon flash. It runs a mobile Linux implementation, which is not widely adopted on phones, but the handset costs only 140 euro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Motorola ZN5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson C901 comes with style, a premium camera and mid-range features. In all honesty, it was hard to find something we didn't like about it, particularly at such a low price point. The list of competitors isn't short, but the C901 can surely compete with the best of them.</paragraph>
