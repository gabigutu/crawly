		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's phablet o'clock on HTC's watch and they're shifting gear and changing direction. Done expanding the One portfolio towards the compact end of the spectrum, HTC are going the other way with the aptly named One Max. It builds on a proven formula emphasizing media consumption and looks, while bringing a few welcome new features to the lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The expandable storage deals with one of the chronic liabilities of the One, so you're no longer limited in your selection of videos and songs to enjoy on the excellent speakers and the now even bigger screen. There's also the latest Android release powering the whole thing, coupled with the most up-to-date edition of HTC's proprietary Sense UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The choice of Snapdragon 600 over its more capable Snapdragon 800 sibling is bound to raise a few eyebrows, but realistically, the Snapdragon 600 is no slouch either and it has never left an impression of being underpowered. And with the resolution unchanged over the HTC One, there will be no extra strain on the GPU to worry about either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So what we need to find out now is whether the Sense UI 5.5 is as good as HTC touts it to be, and whether the fingerprint scanner can be a key selling point. We already saw an excellent hardware implementation of the feature by Apple in the iPhone 5s, but the software failed to make proper use of it. We now set out to find what HTC did differently and how well it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first thing - first. The HTC One Max is getting a proper physical examination right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC One Max 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max measures 164.5 x 82.5 x 10.3 mm, which makes it notably larger than the Samsung Galax Note 3 (151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm). The extra millimeters around the waistline are particularly easy to feel on a device of this size and along with the much heavier weight (217g vs 168g) make the One Max notably harder to wield than the Galaxy phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the HTC One Max has dual front-mounted speakers and a 0.2" larger screen to show for it, and it's up to everyone to decide for themselves whether the trade-off is worth it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max is an instantly recognizable member of the company's high-end lineup. It offers the same combination of metal, high-quality plastic and glass as the One mini and provides the same premium feel as the other two members of the One family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entirely plastic sides are certainly not as cool at the metal edges on the original One, but they are certainly more durable and since they don't take too much away in terms of looks, we find this a good solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course a device this big can't quite match the sophistication of the mini (or even the original One), but once you hold the One Max you will immediately know that it's a premium offering. And while the weight might take its toll on the usability it certainly contributes to the solid vibe the phablet gives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And, yes, the fingerprint sensor doesn't sit as pretty on the silver back as it did on the home button of the iPhone 5s, but that's mostly nitpicking. Bottom line is the HTC One Max is a sleek smartphone, which you'd feel proud of owning (once you get past the usual "is that a phone or a tablet" jokes).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint scanner aside, the HTC One Max features the same set of controls as the other two members of the One family.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel still features a loudspeaker with BoomSound tech either side of the screen. A strip of glass right below the display is home to the two capacitive keys, Back and... well, Home. A long-press the Home button launches Google Now, while a double tap brings up the task switcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no dedicated Menu and App switcher keys, but their absence is made up for with clever gestures around the UI. Normally you need to pull down when at the top of a list (app drawer or BlinkFeed for example) to reveal the extra available settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen is the front-facing camera, plus the ambient light and proximity sensors. The top speaker takes the role of an earpiece during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera on the HTC One Max is the same as on the One - it has a 2.1MP sensor with a wide-angle lens and it can shoot even 1080p video, complete with HDR mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the phablet features a couple of keys - the volume rocker and the power button. We have complained about HTC placing the power keys on its smartphone on top, where reaching it is the hardest and the company has finally listened. Not only is the right side of the One Max the most obvious choice for the location of a button as frequently used as this one, but the location also lets you index finger fall right above the fingerprint scanner when unlocking the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port and the mouthpiece are at the bottom. The USB port is MHL-enabled, so you can use it for HD TV-Out and for USB Host functionality. There's a noise cancelling mic at the back of the phablet. Besides its usual noise cancelling duties, the second mic keeps track of how loud the ambient noise is and the One Max will boost the sound from the mouthpiece to make sure the other side hears you loud and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the HTC One Max features the 3.5mm audio jack and the IR emitter, which can be used for controlling various home equipment. The phablet comes with a remote app preinstalled and we found it to work quite well, while supporting a long list of devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Controls (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The left side of the HTC One Max houses the knob that releases the back panel. The detachable back plate is the other big difference when comparing the phablet to the international version of its One sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the HTC One Max is way busier than those of the One and One min. You get the familiar cutouts for the 4 megapixel camera lens and its LED flash, but there's more going on this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right under the camera lens sits the fingerprint scanner. HTC has stayed mum on what makes it tick, but it confirmed that the sensor here operates differently to the Apple's Touch ID. Not that we couldn't have figured that out by ourselves as the One Max requires you to swipe you finger over it, rather than just place it on top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that we found the One Max fingerprint scanner to be quite quick to react and accurate enough to be actually usable. We'll pay the feature and its functionality a bit more attention later on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other elements of interest at the back are the secondary microphone used for noise cancelling and the pogo pins that are used for attaching the battery-extending Power Flip Case.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Despite featuring a removable back panel, the HTC One Max doesn't grant you access to its 3,300mAh Li-Po battery. All you get underneath are the microSIM and microSD slots. Memory expansion is a feature many have looked for in the One lineup for a while now and it's good to see HTC finally delivering.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We completed the batter test and the ample battery delivered quite impressive numbers. The final score was an exciting 81h, and the endurance in the individual challenges was great too.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can find the complete breakdown of the One Max battery performance over here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gorgeous 5.9" display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max has a brilliant 5.9" IPS LCD screen, that has an image quality quite similar to the HTC One 4.7-incher. The extended diagonal has caused the pixel density to drop to just 373ppi, but at this point the difference is rather hard to spot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has been putting out some excellent screens recently and the One Max's display is just another example of this. The contrast is impressive and the viewing angles are extremely wide - there's no shift in colors and only a slight contrast loss at extreme angles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is laminated too, for a maximum close fit between individual layers, bringing the image as close as possible to the surface of the glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only area of the HTC One Max screen performance that could be improved is sunlight legibility. It's not doing bad by any means, helped by its good brightness levels, but it's not quite up there with the best either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android 4.3 and Sense 5.5 in charge of UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max runs on the latest available Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, but more importantly it comes with the latest version of Sense UI, 5.5. Much like Samsung, HTC prefers to add its own exclusive features to Android, instead of marching to Google's drum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Sense 5.5 brings better BlinkFeed, new camera features, customizable toggles, and the long awaited option to turn the BlinkFeed off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick overview of the HTC One Max interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen now accepts widgets. You can reveal the second lockscreen with a swipe and start adding widgets. Each widget occupies a single pane. Unfortunately, there are very few available widgets for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default lockscreen pane remains untouched. There's a clock, weather info and four shortcut slots. You can put a folder instead of an app shortcut if you need more than four apps accessible right from the lockscreen. Missed calls and incoming messages are duly displayed, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no way to change lockscreen shortcuts independently from the ones docked on the homescreen. Many users may find that inconvenient - LG and Samsung both let you do that on their phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen looks the same as we left it in HTC One's Android 4.2. The leftmost pane is the familiar BlinkFeed that resembles the Flipboard UI a lot. Thankfully, you can now turn the BlinkFeed off, if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service aggregates posts from your social networks and stories from over a thousand news sources. You can pick what topics you're interested in and BlinkFeed will automatically pull relevant content. You can also search for specific content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed has been updated with the new Sense 5.5 UI. Now you can reveal the new options menu with a swipe to the right. There you can select a specific topic or launch a search through the BlinkFeed content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have social network accounts linked, you can post on them straight from BlinkFeed, including sharing stories that you've come across on the feed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, BlinkFeed now offers you the option to save articles for later. You just need to tap the Read later dedicated icon when reading an article and it will be saved for later in the sliding-out menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like its predecessors, the HTC One Max doesn't have a Menu key at all. Most of the UI has a virtual menu key, though, and most of the apps in the Play Store have already been updated so they don't require a Menu button, so that's hardly anything to worry about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is one aspect of the interface where the HTC Sense has lately been a bit behind the curve. It's a pretty barren place to start with - you get the notifications themselves, the clock and date, and a shortcut to go to the power toggles page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yup, the power toggles are not placed on the notifications area of the pull-down menu, but you need a second tap to access them. Alternatively, you access them from everywhere by a slide down with two fingers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's new here on the HTC One Max is that for the first time on Sense UI you can choose the available toggles and their order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, all that's left for HTC is to implement the long-press functionality, which other manufacturers have (a long press opens the corresponding settings menu).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond what we just listed, Sense UI 5.5 feels very similar to its predecessor. You get up to five homescreen panes to fill with shortcuts and widgets (the sixth is reserved for BlinkFeed). Upon a pinch zoom, the enabled homescreen panes are displayed in the top one third of the screen, the rest available to the interface for adding widgets and shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the homescreen management interface, you can set any of the panes as default - including the BlinkFeed. Widgets are pulled out of a dedicated container and are not displayed in the app drawer, which we find to be the more intuitive approach. Another notable difference from Samsung TouchWiz and the LG Optimus UI is that the HTC One's homescreen panes cannot be scrolled in a loop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the app drawer itself, the default layout is a 3 x 4 grid of icons, which does not make best use of the huge, high-res screen. The icons aren't even bigger than usual, they just have plenty of padding. Luckily, you can switch to a 4 x 5 grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either grid represents an Apple-style vertically scrollable list with an auto-hiding scroll bar on the right, indicating the number of "pages" the list of apps extends across. That's it, no extra tabs for widgets or recent downloads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sorting options (alphabetical, custom and chronological) are available on a hidden toolbar that shows upon a swipe down in the top page of the app drawer. It also hides shortcuts to the Google Play Store and Search, and lets you manage apps and select grid size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task switching interface is the same as in previous Ones - recent apps are displayed in a 3 x 3 grid of thumbnails, which makes way better use of all the available screen size and resolution. It's a single screen that cannot be scrolled, so nine of the most recently used apps is the most you can get. To terminate apps you have to swipe up or down (not left or right). The task switcher launches upon a double tap of the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu is untouched as well - everything is where you'd expect it to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wallpapers, ringtones, notification sounds and alarms can be customized straight from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max comes with a dedicated Car mode screen, which has been styled to look like the rest of the interface. There are only five big controls besides the clock and weather info. There's music info too, which takes a whole row by itself, along with shortcuts to Navigation, Dialer, the Music player (again) and for Voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to automatically launch when you put the phone in the car dock and connect to the car Audio over Bluetooth. There's also an option to resume playback of the music player or radio when the Car mode app launches, for an uninterrupted listening experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an interesting option in the phone's app drawer, borrowed from Windows Phone 8. It's called Kid mode and it is actually an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they can have access to. One annoying bit is that to enable Kid mode the first time around, you need to sign up via email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also comes with premium features and you can pretty much get it on any other Android smartphone running Android Froyo and up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC usually includes an app to help you switch from your old phone by transferring the important data, and on the HTC One it's been updated. It can transfer data from an old HTC phone or an Android from a different maker (v2.3 Gingerbread and above), a Windows Phone, a BlackBerry, an iPhone or even some featurephones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The switch from an iPhone is pretty easy - the One can even read the data off an iPhone backup file, so even if you've lost or sold your iPhone, you'd still be able to copy all your contacts and personal files easily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of iPhone, HTC introduces a new feature called Do Not Disturb mode, which does exactly what its iOS DND counterpart does. It gives users further control of notifications. If turned on, it will mute incoming calls or alerts, including LED notifications. You can allow calls from your favorite contacts, you can allow alarms and timer too, and you have the option to set the auto turn off interval. Unfortunately, you will have to turn the DND mode on manually every time, there is no scheduling option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dedicated shortcut to activate the DND feature in the notification pane with the toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the One Max is of the phablet kind, HTC did nothing particular to enhance the big-screen user experience. There are no single-hand operation mode, no specific phablet-oriented apps or productivity perks (such as split-screen or something), and while there is stylus support (and an official HTC stylus), there's not slot for it on the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only HTC has provided the One Max users is the Scribble app that allows you to draw with fingers or a stylus and save your scetches. It offers different templates, but is still far behind the Note 3 services or even LG's Quick Note.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Fingerprint sensor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>One of the cool new features brought by the HTC One Max is the fingerprint sensor on its back. Unlike Apple's implementation, this one requires you to slide your finger over it, rather than just hold it on top, but it is still quick and accurate enough. The One Max recognizes up to three fingers, which is even more limiting than Apple's Touch ID maximum of five records.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a value-added feature you can assign an app to each stored fingerprint so it gets activated automatically with the screen unlock. That way you can have your index finger launch the phone app, your middle finger launch the camera, and have another finger simply unlock the Max. Unfortunately, those shortcuts are no longer available once you unlock the phablet, which we find to be quite disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To set a fingerprint you need to swipe three times on the sensor. That kinda reminded us of the first times we saw fingerprint sensors on phones - the Toshiba G900 had a similar learning setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the G900, the One Max sensor is pretty accurate, but because you need to do a swipe gesture, not just tap and hold, we find it slower than Apple's solution. There are some occasions when you are in a hurry and you are just not slow enough for the sensor to read your finger, which has the potential of getting in your way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a quick setting for the Fingerprint reader in the Notification Quick Settings pane. It will take you straight to input a new fingerprint screen if you have a free fingerprint slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, before you setup a fingerprint lock, you will be asked to enter a password for security reasons. In case you are unable to use the fingerprint scanner, you can unlock the device with that password.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks and performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One Max runs on the Snapdragon 600 chipset - the same ticking inside the HTC One and inside at least one variant of the Samsung Galaxy S4. It has four Krait 300 cores clocked at 1.7GHz, Adreno 320 is in charge of graphics and there are 2GB or RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual our first test is all about single-core performance. The Krait 300 score is on par with the S600-running Galaxy S4 devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC One Max repeats the result from our previous test, performing equally to the S600 gang on the multi-threaded version of Linpack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 is a popular CPU benchmark, where the One Max scores a hair below the original HTC One.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant and AnTuTu 4 gauge the overall device performance instead of just the CPU and the One Max managed to produce the same results the HTC One did earlier this year.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've put the Adreno 320 GPU through the GFX Benchmark. It did as we expected - decent, on par with the S600 Galaxies and One, but noticeably slower than the S800's Adreno 330.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The updated Epic Citadel benchmark has the new Ultra High Quality setting and we've re-tested every 1080p device we possibly could. The One Max scored just a whisker below the HTC One.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The JavaScript performance of the HTC One Max is decent, though the SunSpider score is the lowest we've seen on a Snapdragon 600 device.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The combined BrowserMark 2 benchmark showed the HTC One Max is once again on par with the rest of the S600 gang.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the HTC One did better on Vellamo than the original One and on par with the Butterfly S.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, HTC One Max performs exactly as well as you would expect from a Snapdragon 600 device. This is no longer Qualcomm's top-of-the-line chipset, but it delivers excellent lag-free user experience that won't disappoint anyone. The latest top-notch games won't pose much challenge either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Snapdragon 800 shows its superiority when it comes to web browsing speed and app loading times. It's not a choice between good and bad performance, more like between great and the best, but when you are shopping in this price range the best is often the only one good enough.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As an integral part of Android Jelly Bean Google Now is present on the HTC One Max. You can get to it by holding the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will display information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to Google Now and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this from the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Google Now widget which generates information for you based on what your interests are.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People app in Sense 5.5 has seen some minor changes too. Instead of clickable tabs on the bottom of the screen you get side-scrollable tabs on the top, which is a more convenient solution (and along the lines of stock Android's solution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and finally the "Gallery" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more. If a contact is linked with a Facebook or other account you can see them either merged or choose to view either profile.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony works like a charm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max did a fantastic job in our signal test, providing great reception in environments where others dropped calls. The volume in the earpiece was extremely loud (we almost never used it at full volume) while clarity wasn't an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC One Max displays your recent calls with the usual tabs above accessible via side-swipes. There's smart dialing on the One Max and works really well. Once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max doesn't support video calling over the cellular network by default, which is a pity, given that you get a wide-view front-facing camera. The good news is there are a bunch of apps which could fill in the blank spot with video calling over Wi-Fi and 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, Quiet ring on pickup will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has integrated a clever Do Not Disturb feature, which blocks all incoming calls and mutes all notifications. It allows you to set up an exceptions list with select contacts who can reach you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC BoomSound stereo speakers perform excellently and managed to score a Good mark in our test. This puts it head to head with the Galaxy Note 3 and even beats the HTC One by a hair. You can find more about the testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging well set<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC One Max are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's Gtalk, which can connect you to Google's chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered - the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. "drx" matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or about a third in landscape. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard has been redesigned. Keys are well spaced but the overlay doesn't include any gaps between them, which is only a cosmetic feature and poses no discomfort. The 5.9" diagonal offers more than plenty of space for comfortable typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has included Trace keyboard, which acts like Swipe. You drag a finger over the desired keys and the phone predicts what you're trying to write. It works really well but language support is limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the built-in HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color-coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs, but they are hidden by default. You can choose Edit tabs from the menu and pull out the ones you want. You can choose from Favorites, Unread, Marked, Invites and Attached.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC One Max lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Zoe is enhanced in Sense 5.5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Zoe is more advanced than any other gallery on a phone and it was made possible by the dedicated ImageChip 2 that the One Max uses. When you use the camera in Zoe mode, every time you press the shutter key, the phone captures up to 20 full res shots and a 3 second video (1 second before you press the shutter key and 2 seconds after). All that information is required for the advanced features of Zoe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of those features is Events. Zoe can be used as a regular image gallery with photos stacked together by folders, but Events groups photos by when and where they were taken. Each event has a 30 second highlight video, which is stitched together from those 3 second clips plus a slideshow, including some of the pics. You can remove clips and add new ones to the highlight video, add a video effect and also include a background music (the tracks are preset, though it is possible to add new ones to the list).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gallery UI is updated in Sense 5.5 and is now navigated by sliding the panes left or right, instead of the dropdown menu of the previous version of Sense. HTC's Video Highlights feature is at the forefront of the Gallery interface and shows your latest snaps and videos in a flashy way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can easily edit the Video Highlights, too. HTC offers you to adjust the video playback speed, select which videos and photos get played as well as add music of your choice. Naturally, there are some predefined themes (12 in total) as well, if you don't feel like doing too much work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Creating Video Highlights on the go is also an option as by just picking one image the One Max will offer you similar ones. It's quite accurate and reliable as well. Best of all, it's not restricted by time and can be any length you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The animation in the Gallery is seamless which is more than we can say about it outside the HTC One Max. If you save the pictures into your PC you're left with 20 shots for every Zoe animation created. The good news is HTC allows you to upload the sequences to HTC's Zoeshare webpage and send the links to your friends. Images there are displayed like GIFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos and multiple full-res shots come into play when editing images as well. Since the phone has a video of the scene during which the photo was taken, it can find moving objects and put a red X on them so that you can tap and remove the ones you want, but keep the rest. The result is a full-resolution 4MP image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zoe can also make sure everyone in the photo is smiling and their eyes are open - it detects all faces and circles them, then you can swipe to go through all available images of that face until you find the perfect one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another feature is called Sequence shot. It takes a shot of a moving object and it creates a cool effect "multiple exposure" effect where that object appears several times on the photo. It's perhaps easier to show the effect than explain it, here's a shot of a BMXer jumping over a ramp. You can tweak the effect by adding and removing clones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zoe arsenal of effects doesn't stop here - there are some vanity effects too. One such effect is Face contour, which allows you to easily slim someone's face. There's also Skin smoothing, an automatic lightning fix, Eye enhancer (which makes your subject's eyes open wider), Eye brightening, Red-eye removal and Anti-shine. The strength of these effects is adjustable with a slider so you can fine tune it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The photo editor feature also lets you create GIF animated images from videos. The interface for creating them is simple enough by providing a slider with handlebars that adjust the length of the GIF. You can also adjust the speed, direction of play as well as apply different effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's just the Retouch section of the Photo Editor. There are also effects, frames and transformations available. Basically, Zoe is a knowledgeable Photoshop helping hand in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we said, Zoe events can be shared on the dedicated Zoe Share site and we've prepared several albums to share with you: Album 1, Album 2, Album 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before you can find a map with your Geo-tagged images in the Gallery.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player with very limited codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Video player on the HTC One Max has a pretty simple interface. There isn't even a dedicated app, you just pick a video from the gallery. Anyway, you get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to launch the camera and a small square with the current time and battery charge. Those automatically hide after a few seconds, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player can use the Beats audio sound enhancement just like the music player, which is great for watching videos. The video player supports DLNA and you can use an MHL adaptor to plug the phone into a TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One pretty unique feature allows you to change the playback speed of the video. This is helpful for clips, you've shot in one of the high frame rate modes, it allows you to watch either a High Frame Rate (it playbacks in real-time, just like The Hobbit) or in slow motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max failed pretty miserably when it came to codec support . It couldn't play all our DivX videos save for one, MOV files were out of the question and did choke with some audio codecs (like AC3).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos that played did so up to 1080p, which is a given with this CPU but still deserves a note. With a large display like that the HTC One Max is some proper codec support away from becoming a powerful tool for watching video on the go. Luckily there are a few dozen video players in the Play store to address that deficiency and some of them are even free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player sans Beats<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max comes with a custom music player, which, as we said earlier, isn't Beats enabled. It can organize your music library by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders (we don't see this option very often). The phone will also easily stream songs over DLNA, you're not limited to the music library you have in the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the Gallery app, the interface of the Music app is also swipe based. This makes navigation easier as it doesn't require you to reach the dropdown menu that was present on Sense 5. Anyhow, the rest of the interface has remained unchanged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has some handy features out of the box. It can automatically look for and download Album art and artist photos (you can limit it to Wi-Fi connections only) and it can also search for lyrics. The lyrics can be displayed either in karaoke mode or just as text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max doesn't come with BeatsAudio sound enhancement but we found that to have no negative effect on the audio output quality. Unfortunately, there no equalizers whatsoever in the Music player making it harder to tune the music the way you like it. Nevertheless, there are plenty of apps on the Play Store that offer this functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and it has even been integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio and TuneIn Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the headphones or loudspeaker choice you also get Mono sound if the reception is poor. There's no Beats enhancement here, however, not is there a playback control card on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also go with TuneIn Radio. It relies on your internet connection and can play just about every station on the planet that's gone broadband (let's face it, most of them are). And the quality is arguably even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set stations as favorites, search local stations by country or genre, and the app will even list you results to specific artist, album or song searches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can also set your alarm to wake you up with your favorite station. Keep in mind that you need an active connection for this and it does tend to take the life out of your battery fast in the morning.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Beats is gone, audio output is still class-leading<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The fact that HTC One Max lacks a Beats audio label got quite a few people worried that it might not be able to match the audio output of its One sibling. As it turns out there was nothing to worry about, though, as the phablet has some of the finest audio in business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier, the One Max deliver flawless output with no weak points whatsoever. All the readings are perfect and the volume levels are great - a combo none of the One Max competitors can deliver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More impressively, there's virtually no distortion when you plug in a pair of headphones. Except for the very minor bump in stereo crosstalk the output is unaffected. And even that is only detectable if you have lab equipment like we do. A stellar overall performance by the One Max.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>UltraPixel camera without OIS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max uses the same 4MP UltraPixel sensor that was introduced with the HTC One, except without the optical image stabilization (OIS). It's about the size of most smartphone camera sensors (1/3") but thanks to its lower resolution it has much bigger pixels. On the up side, bigger pixels have better performance in poor lighting conditions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensor has a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is perfect for viewing on the phone, on most tablets (which typically have 16:10 screens) and HDTVs. 4:3 photos that other phones produce would either get black bars or get cropped, which does help close the resolution gap somewhat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the camera side, HTC Sense 5.5 has added a few software improvements. You can now shoot simultaneously with both cameras with a PiP dual-shot mode, and can even resize and relocate the smaller window while recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface itself is pretty simple - there are two shutter keys (one for stills and one for video), above them is the gallery shortcut and below is the effects button. On the left side of the screen you get flash mode selector and the Zoe toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, we already covered what Zoe does after you've taken a shot, here's how the actual shooting goes. You enable Zoe (an indicator at the bottom of the screen confirms you're in Zoe mode) and tap the still shutter key. The key turns into a progress bar, counting down the three seconds during which the phone records video, reminding you to stay relatively still.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera on the One Max produces images that have decent color, but rather low detail and the exposure is not the best we've seen. Also, surprisingly given the larger pixels, there is a fair amount of noise. There are some oversharpening halos and purple fringing, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewed at 1080p resolution, the photos look pretty good, but there's very little room for cropping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max has HDR support for both its still image and videos. In stills, HDR mode gives shadows a good boost, but it tends to wash out the highlights. At least the effect isn't as exaggerated as on the HTC One. Note that HDR photos do have some extra smearing as the phone has to align and compose a couple of different exposures.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max has the same camera as the rest of the new HTC One family, sans the image stabilization. You can see how the two stack up and how they compare to other cameras using our tool's resize option.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>FullHD video camera with HDR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max can shoot videos at up to 1080p resolution at 30fps. It has an HDR option for the video, but enabling that causes the framerate to fall to 28fps and the field of view gets narrower. It also supports 720p @ 60fps high framerate video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features continuous autofocus and you have the option to lock the focus during video recording, if it hunts too much in dynamic scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 files with a 20Mbps bitrate - among the highest we've seen. Sound is captured in stereo with 192Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate. Framerate wasn't a solid 30fps and sometimes would dip as low as 28fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features some very good resolved detail, which it retains even in low light. Colors are slightly off (oversaturated), but not as much as most other phones produce, and there is a good amount of noise which gets introduced under low light. Still, the One Max features one of the better camcorders we've seen, as long as you stick to 30fps (more on this below). Unfortunately for it, the device that captures the best videos around is its direct rival - the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a FullHD video sample captured with the One Max we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 1080p sample (0:14s, 37.0MB) taken straight off the HTC One Max.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR videos capture more detail in the highlights, but don't do much for the shadows. The white balance is off (videos have a purple tint) and the colors are duller. Combined with the narrower FoV, we'd only enable HDR for videos as a last resort when shooting against the sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind, however, that the field of view get significantly narrower during HDR video capture, which means you'll be able to fit much less into the frame than you normally would. Note that 720p mode also has a narrower FoV, nearly the same as the 1080p HDR mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a 60 frames per second mode on the HTC One Max but it reduces the maximum resolution to 720p. This doesn't sound too bad, but the actual output is pretty bad. There's very little detail and even though the clips are really smooth, we'd advise you to stay away from this mode. Oddly, we found that the 720p @ 60fps mode has the widest FoV, wider than even 1080p with HDR off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've added the HTC One Max to our video quality comparison tool. Here it really managed to show what it's capable of, particularly when you look at the low-light video where it fared quite impressively.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max is jam packed with connectivity options and covers a wide array of network frequencies. You get quad-band GSM, quad-band 3G and market-dependent LTE support, making the One Max a true globetrotter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and stereo Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the One Max with a PC. The long list of options includes Portable Wi-Fi hotspot, settings, USB and Bluetooth tethering (the phone becomes a modem).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC connectivity with Android Beam is present too. We found it to work hassle free with webpages and heavier items like photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also a microSD card on the HTC One Max for expanding the 16/32 gigs of onboard storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Portable Hotspot can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max comes with an MHL port, so if you plug a MHL dongle in, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection. The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV and with the FullHD resolution of the display, watching on an HDTV is a joyful experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max also has a built-in Infrared port, which, coupled with the excellent remote app, allows you to remotely control a whole host of living room equipment. The smartphone can be setup to control all sorts of TV's, receivers, various video and audio players - pretty much any gadget that uses the standard Infrared remote controls.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser has full Flash support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC One Max comes with the latest version of the Sensed-out Android web browser. Combined with the fullHD display and potent Snapdragon 600 power inside, the Jelly Bean browser makes for an awesome time on the web.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of its UI is out of sight, leaving the entire screen to the web page. And even when it does appear it consists of a single bar, which now holds the address field, the Tabs and Menu dropdown shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has also thrown in some extra buttons at the bottom of the screen, which seemed to pop up when you scroll back to the top of a page, which was getting a bit annoying at times. You see sometimes those buttons appeared along with the top bar, whereas on other occasions they remained hidden when the top bar was showing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from being way too big, those mysteriously behaving buttons let you save a page in your bookmarks or reading list, view bookmarks, saved pages or tabs. You might want to enable Quick controls - they let you tap on any point on the edge of the screen and move your finger to select the desired option from a jog-dial menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner - they can't be swiped off the screen like you do in the app switcher. Incognito tabs are available if you want to browse without leaving traces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another cool feature is preloading search results that the phone believes are relevant, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Happily, the HTC One Max comes with full Flash support in the browser. We tested a couple of games and videos and everything worked like a charm. That's not something many smartphones boast nowadays.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Organizing is dully covered on the HTC One Max. Office documents are handled through the preloaded Polaris Office 5 app. It supports Excel, Word, PowerPoint and more and lets you view and edit files on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested a couple of Word and Excel files and found the One Max perfectly capable of handling them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar on the HTC One Max has been redesigned in accordance to the refreshed Sense 5.5 look. For one days aren't highlighted in a hand-drawn circle but regularly instead. Instead of the selectable tabs now the Calendar lets you side-swipe between tabs (just like in the People app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has four different types of view: daily, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation view only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), only one of which you can sync with your computer. You can also easily show/hide the ones you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the HTC One Max features a 5.9" display, it's very comfortable to draw on. HTC takes care of that with a new app dubbed Scribble. It's intended for note taking, making lists as well as fun activities like drawing pictures or making cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening it greets you with a number of available templates that can jump start your work. After you've done you can either share the scribble by uploading it to the cloud or simply save it to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator on board. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app comes with World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch and a Timer. The World clock is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and zoom in on it freely. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock application can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The stopwatch and timer are pretty self explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tasks app is here as well. It does exactly what the name suggests and can access your Google Tasks. There is no location-based reminder support unlike with Any.DO, iOS's Reminders, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Weather app is here too. It became popular years ago with its cool weather animations and widget. You can preset many cities across the globe and it uses the Yahoo! Weather info (much like Samsung and Apple do).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has all the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it. You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important ones are covered (file managers, audio and video players, navigation apps, document readers etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no HTC Hub in the Jelly Bean version of HTC's Android implementation. This means you can't get additional HTC wallpapers, HTC lockscreens, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in about 10-15 seconds (with A-GPS switched off no less). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is an integral part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max is a solid phablet - there are no two ways about that. The awesome screen is nicely complemented by the front-mounted stereo speakers and excellent battery life to round off one of the best devices around for gaming and watching video. Granted, the built-in video player is rather limited in terms of codec support, but that's nothing a quick trip to the Google Play Store can't fix.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also the metal unibody, which makes sure that the One Max is one of hottest looking phablets you can get (and it would look even sharper in black, if there ever is a black version).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, even a solid foundation like this one is not always enough considering the kind of competition that the One Max is facing. With a price-tag matching that of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, the HTC phablet can't afford any compromise if it so much as hopes to win this around. Sadly, it does make a fair share of those.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UltraPixel camera is basically a one-trick pony (with only low light photos worth their salt), and without OIS even that might be an overstatement. There's also the chipset, which while certainly snappy, is not the stuff flagships are made of these days. Snapdragon 600 is good enough, but Snapdragon 800 is better and it makes for a difference that you can actually feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The less than optimal usage of the available space at the front is also somewhat of an issue. With a screen diagonal that's only a fraction of an inch bigger than that of the Galaxy Note 3, the One Max is 13mm taller, 3mm wider and 2mm thicker than the Note, which for some is already too big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One Max faces a much harder task than the HTC One had at launch. Earlier this year, the HTC One was able to happily match the Galaxy S4 for processing power, had OIS to back up its low-res camera and had a distinct advantage in looks and build. But the Galaxy S4 is no longer the smartphone to beat this season and the One Max doesn't have any advantages whatsoever. Sure, it does have the unique fingerprint sensor, but it's so limited functionality at this stage that it would hardly make a real difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you are willing to look past the meanest fish in the phablet pond (the Note 3), you will see another major competitor for the One Max. The Sony Xperia Z Ultra packs a massive 6.44" Triluminous display, which makes it the biggest fish in this pond. Sony hasn't been particularly careful with the bezels either, but the Xperia Z Ultra packs a Snapdragon 800 chipset and costs ?100 less, being waterproof at that, so it's certainly worth a second look even if it's the most unwieldy of the phablet species.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Note 3 ? Sony Xperia Z Ultra</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final phablet worthy of your attention is the upcoming Acer Liquid S2. Offering 4K video recording and a ring LED flash, the Snapdragon 800-powered beast might turn out to be the dark horse in the phablet race.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer Liquid S2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in the end, the HTC One Max is a solid device that has more than enough to keep you happy, but it may have a hard time luring you into the store in the first place. Unless HTC delivers a prompt upgrade that makes the fingerprint scanner a real game-changer, it will probably have to cut the One Max's price a bit to keep the phablet relevant.</paragraph>
