			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia officially announced its first ever family of Android smartphones. Meet the X family of smartphones consisting of the Nokia X, Nokia X+ and Nokia XL.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't make any mistake about it, this is not a Google-certified project and thus the X phones don't run the Google Play Services such as the Play Store, Gmail and Chrome. Nokia and Microsoft have worked hard though to integrate their core services and apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result, all phones have the excellent Nokia HERE Maps, as well as the Microsoft One Drive (former SkyDrive) and Skype. Users will be free to sideload any Android app they want and can download new apps easily from the dedicated Nokia store and Yandex Store, which is quite popular in Russia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X+ and XL share the same chipset - a 1GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 with 768MB of RAM. The Nokia X is the only one with just 512MB of RAM.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia X hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X features a 4" IPS LCD display of WVGA (480 x 800 pixels) resolution. Colors are okay, brightness and contrast are reasonable, but nothing spectacular out of a sub-100 euro device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the hood, the entire Nokia X range shares the same 1GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 chipset, with only the X somewhat limited at 512MB of RAM. Internal storage is just 4GB, but is expandable up to 32GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the Nokia X there's a 3MP fixed focus camera, but no front-facer. The phone weighs 129 grams and packs a 1500mAh battery. It's good for 10.5 hours of 3G talk time and a maximum standby time of 17 days. It is also capable of up to 26 hours of music playback, while video playback time is quoted at 8.4 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the X is superb. The plastic feels nice as with most recent Nokia smartphones and isn't a ferocious fingerprint magnet. It's quite sturdy too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, Android runs well on the X, despite the lower RAM than the other two X members. It's also very easy to navigate around as the tiles offer a comfortable view of what you have on the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X is no performance monster, but we ran some benchmarks anyway. The phone to compare it is the Moto G, which has noticeably higher-end specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a side note, we downloaded Benchmark Pi and AnTuTu 4 from the app store on the phone - it's great to see content in a store that's just a few days old.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia X+ hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia X+ is a bumped up version of the Nokia X, but not by much, as only the RAM has been affected. It's up from 512MB to 768MB, and while it doesn't sound a lot, it makes a difference in terms of actual experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between apps is a bit faster as is navigating around the operating system. You'll also be able to play a bit more demanding games too, which will otherwise be unplayable on the lower RAM on the X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality and feel of the X+ is identical to the X and both have the same color options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bump in RAM increases the price of the X+ to &amp;euro99. The Nokia X costs ?10 less, so you'll have to decide if reaching deeper into your pockets for the X+ is worth it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia XL hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia showroom floor at the MWC 2014 is drawing crowds eager to see Android running on Nokia hardware. We've managed to get cozy with the Nokia XL for a minute and we're now going to tell you all about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL features a 5" IPS LCD display of WVGA resolution and it's not all that bad. Yes, the phone is cheap at ?109, so we are not expecting much to begin with. That said, colors are nice, but contrast isn't great. As you'll see from the live Nokia XL photos below, it gets covered in smudges in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This tells us that Nokia has cut corners by not placing a protective coating on top of the display to prevent it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tthe Android experience on the Nokia XL is reasonably smooth. The phone runs a version of Jelly Bean as far as we could tell, but the exact version is not specified. The 1GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 chipset does a good job of running and switching between multiple.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has also included a bunch of its Lumia apps on the XL including its Store, Camera, Mix Radio and HERE Maps. Microsoft's presence is also felt with the addition of Skype and OneDrive apps. Speaking of which, XL users will get 10GB of free OneDrive storage as well as 1 month free of Skype Premium. Speaking of goodies, Nokia also includes a 4GB microSD card in the XL's package</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL is made of plastic with an exclusive paint job that the X and X+ don't get - bright orange. The finish feels very nice to the touch, similar to the Nokia Asha 501 and Lumia 1320.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the phone, there's a 5MP camera with LED flash. As you can see from the photos, there's a large physical key below the display, which acts like a Home/back button. The user interface is overly simple too, with two main screens - the app list screen and fastlane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The list of apps is reminiscent of the WP8 home screen with resizable app tiles. The larger the tile, the more information it displays. For example expanding the People's tile will display your favorite contacts, while the Gallery will show the latest photos you've snapped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XL measures 141.4 mm x 77.7 mm x 10.9mm with a weight of 190g. The back covers are replaceable.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia XL has the same CPU and GPU, but with more RAM - 768MB. We expected a minor performance edge, but the three benchmarks we ran showed virtually no difference. Again, the Moto G is the one to measure up to.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia 230 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia made the headlines with the Android-powered X line of devices (X, X+ and XL) but the affordable Nokia 220 and Asha 230 are also on display. Both feature dual-SIM versions as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We got to spend some quality time with the 220 and Asha 230. The 220 starts at an insanely-low ?29 while the Asha 230 starts at ?45. Both devices we handled at the Mobile World Congress were yellow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 230 is a touchscreen device ? even the back button is capacitive. There are physical unlock and volume keys. It has a 2.8&#x2033; screen of QVGA (320 x 240) resolution and clocks in at 142 pixels per inch. The Asha 230 includes Nokia?s Glance screen tech, a slap in the face of the Lumia 520. The Nokia 220 has a 2MP camera on the back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastics used in the Asha 230 feel even lesser in quality compared to the Nokia 220. The Asha 230 is heavier at 89.3 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen looks okay at these specs. The Asha UI isn't immune to stutter, probably due to the lower-end internals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 230 comes with a 1020mAh battery that?s good for 33 days of stand by time according to Nokia. Talk time over 2G is rated at 11 hours. There?s a 1.3 MP camera on board.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 220 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 220 is a non-touch device which focuses on the bare necessities in order to accommodate the ?29 price tag. The 220 comes with only 2G connectivity, skipping even Wi-Fi along the way. It does, however, feature preinstalled Twitter and Facebook apps. The plastic used in the 220 isn?t the best but feels okay to the touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this price point we can?t really expect miracles, the phone is very thick at 13.2 mm for starters. The UI is fluid enough and the buttons are good and those not enamored with touchscreen will love the full numpad. The 2.4&#x2033; QVGA LCD offers an unimpressive 166 ppi but has good colors. The 220 weighs a manageable 83.6 g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 220 is available starting today while the Asha 230 will start hitting the shelves in March.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia X app store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While handling the Nokia X phones we installed a couple of benchmarks from Nokia's app store and it dawned on us that it will be interesting to find out just how rich the app store is on what is basically Day 1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We opened Google Play Store on one of our standard Android phones and checked the Editor's Choice and Top Free sections, then we searched for those apps on the Nokia's.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we found is that the X phones use an interesting setup ? there's Nokia's app store, but there are several others preinstalled too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If an app isn't available in Nokia's store, but is available in one of the others, it will show up in the search results. Just tap on it and the other app store will launch and repeat the search. We spotted 4-5 different app stores in our searches. Apps marked with a * are from other app stores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the list of missing apps is longer, but those are mostly games, the only app we really miss is Nova Launcher (though you probably might be able to sideload that directly). At least the apps that are there cover the basic social networking apps (Facebook and Twitter) and the popular chat apps (WhatsApp, Skype, Line, even Telegram). Popular keyboard replacements SwiftKey and Swype are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And what's this ? the Nokia X (X+ and XL too) will have Instagram on Day 1! We are, of course, alluding to how much effort Nokia put into bringing Instagram to Windows Phone (remember all those #2InstaWithLove updates?).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using Android has advantages after all, huh? More importantly, this seemingly confirms Nokia's claim that most apps are compatible with its brand of Android (the missing apps may be missing because they are not uploaded to the alternative app stores, not that they're incompatible).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Nokia has a cool site to help developers test if their app is compatible with Nokia X ? it's literally just drag and drop.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia Icon hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia Icon (aka 929) is the first of Nokia's new generation flagship phones. It's based on the Lumia 1520 phablet, but scaled down to a 5" device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nothing but screen size and battery capacity was lost during the shrinking process, so the Lumia Icon has a 5" 1080p screen (AMOLED this time rather than LCD), a Snapdragon 800 chipset and a huge 1/2.5" camera sensor with 20MP resolution and optical stabilization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is as good as any big AMOLED we've seen ? the Nokia ClearBlack tech (special polarizing filters) help keep reflections to a minimum, which really makes a difference. It helps that at full blast the screen puts out 500nits of brightness. The Nokia has custom software to adjust the screen settings (white balance and saturation).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery capacity went down from 3,400mAh to 2,420mAh, which is on the small side for a 5" phone, but wireless Qi charging allows to quickly and easily top up the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Icon is based on the Lumia 925 design ? an aluminum frame with a polycarbonate back. The sides of the frame are left exposed. The naked aluminum does boost the premium feel of the device ? it's similar to Sony's flagship Xperia phones or iPhone 4/4S, except the plastic on the back hides fingerprints better. It should resist scratches better too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia Icon is 40g lighter than the 1520 phablet, which improves handling, but the device has gotten just over a millimeter thicker. The thicker body does mean that the camera hump has gone away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One interesting feature of the phone is that it has four microphones ? two on the front and two on the back. No wonder this was the focus of the first Lumia Icon ad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that the Nokia Lumia Icon is a CDMA phone for Verizon. There's no official GSM phone with similar specs, but we've heard rumors (there was even a small hope Nokia will unveil the Lumia 930 at the MWC, but alas that didn't happen).</paragraph>
