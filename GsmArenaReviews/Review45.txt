			<paragraph>Make way Nintendo Wii and Project Natal ? the Sony Ericsson Yari can play both motion-based games and camera-tracked gesture controlled games. A 5MP camera and GPS in an attractive package and of course great audio quality ? we might have a winner on our hands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What?s all this gesture gaming we?re going on about? Simple, well, sort of ? Yari uses its secondary camera to track motion so that you can use your body to control the game, like the impressive Project Natal demos you might have seen (and if you haven?t, do ? you?ll know joysticks are a thing of the past). The accelerometer also comes into play ? the Bowling game puts a Wii in your pocket.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Sony Ericsson Yari is not just about games. Even though Sony Ericsson are done using the Cybershot and Walkman labels, Yari?s seems to have both types of genes. It packs a 5MP camera with auto-focus and the audio quality is great. Keep in mind this is a reasonably priced phone we?re talking about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Games, music, navigation ? the Sony Ericsson Yari is a Swiss army knife of a phone. Tech-geeks will be impressed, but the Yari will appeal to civilians as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Jump to the next page, where we open up the box and begin exploring the Sony Ericsson Yari.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Yari<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari box contains all the standard stuff and comes with two not so typical additions. Inside, you?ll find the Yari itself, the charger, a one-piece headset, a USB cable (the Yari uses FastPort so you?ll probably need it), as well as manuals. The Yari also comes with 1GB microSD card to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to the two additions we mentioned ? one is a stand for the Yari, which can hold the phone in portrait or landscape mode, and the other is a microSD card reader. The stand is intended for use with the camera-enabled games, but you can use it to watch videos or play music too. The card reader supports microSD only, but it?s well made and offers faster transfer rates than using the USB cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Yari 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari has rounded corners and a nicely contrasting color scheme. It?s available in three versions ? Achromatic Black, Cranberry White and Metal Rose.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Yari sports a neat and simple design that will probably seem attractive to more conservative users. However, under the ordinary hood lay some pretty extraordinary features that tech-buffs will certainly want to explore.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For starters, there are two small knobs above the display, which are the so-called gaming keys. Those are quite small but that?s by no means their biggest problem. It turned out that their usage in games is quite limited (close to nil actually). Fortunately, they have their function in the camera application. Between the keys in question are the light sensor, the secondary camera and the earpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below them is the 2.4" 16M color display which has pretty good picture quality and acceptable sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the display, an ample circular D-pad is sided by four controls. They are topped by a thin soft key, followed by pretty large Call (left) and End key (right).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom buttons are Activity Menu on the left and Clear key on the right. The styling of the navigation pad is quite elegant and the controls are reasonably usable ? except the soft keys that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are so thin they look like design accents rather than actual buttons. Most likely, you'll be pressing the call key below instead of the soft key itself. Nothing major but it does take some getting used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Up key on the D-pad also acts as a shortcut to the music player, hence the music player icon on top of it. The other sides can also be assigned various shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the phone open reveals a 12-key alphanumeric keypad. It is quite flat offering no tangible borders between the different rows: at least the columns are separated by a slightly raised ridge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left and right rows of keys are somewhat problematic ? they look wide but in fact the active area is limited, so if you?re not pressing spot on, no press is registered. It was frustrating at first and that makes the Yari keypad one of the less comfortable we?ve worked with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson Yari features nothing but the regular FastPort, which echoes back to Sony Ericsson?s glory days but unfortunately also hampers usability quite a bit. A standard microUSB port would have been a much better solution here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset is the top side in digicam terms. It hosts the volume rocker and the two-position camera key. Here you can also find the hot-swappable microSD card slot (no complaints here), hidden under a small plastic lid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom and the top are pretty simple, the lanyard eyelet the only thing to see there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping over the Sony Ericsson Yari we find the 5-megapixel camera lens accompanied by an LED flash. The camera is inset deep into the phone, which offers pretty good protection against scratches and fingerprints. The two loudspeaker grills are also here at either end of the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the 1000 mAh Li-Po battery. It sounds like enough for a feature phone, but after a day of moderate use (10 minutes of telephony, two hours of fiddling with the interface and about 30 photos) the battery fell to 50%. Charging the Yari in the evening is likely to be a common occurrence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the Sony Ericsson Yari is very good. The matte plastic on the back hides all fingerprints, even the glossy plastic on the front does pretty well in that department. We tested the Achromatic Black version, but we imagine that the other two - which are predominantly white - will be even better at concealing fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yari weighs 115 grams, but it doesn?t feel heavy in the hand. The rounded corners make the phone fit snugly in your palm and the big call keys are a pleasure to work with. The positive impressions last until you have used the soft keys or the keypad ? the compromised usability will inevitably affect your opinion of the device. On the other hand, the round D-pad is doing great. Excellent press in all directions, and a very soft and responsive confirm button with nice rubbery finish. No worries with the slider either.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari interface is the regular Sony Ericsson feature phone UI and it is still used in most of their top handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with information on top indicating signal strength, currently used data carrier and battery status. At the bottom of the display just above the context keys are their labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard foursome - theme-dependent, 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view. There's nothing that we haven't seen before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flight mode can only work with a SIM card in the device and requires a restart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is visually appealing and snappy. The Sony Ericsson Yari features an inbuilt accelerometer so auto rotation is enabled, but it only works in the Media Center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari supports Flash Lite themes, which change the color scheme and wallpaper. Our handset has four themes preinstalled: Cranberry white, Silver grey, Clarity and Unlimited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We experienced some lags in the otherwise smooth and visually elaborate interface ? mostly in the Photo gallery ? but we have no other major complaints about system behavior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, you can also use an application as a background instead of an actual image. There?s another app ? Game Carousel ? which places a strip of shortcuts of the currently installed games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To browse the Game Carousel, you press the left soft key (the one that otherwise launches the Media menu). You can either use the D-pad or tilt the phone to get the game icons roll left or right thanks to the accelerometer. Game Carousel is an interesting addition that freshens up the old interface a bit and also serves to underline the gaming slant of the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A phonebook we already know<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way you can set up the phone to autosave to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up your entire contact list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of the contact is written in only one field, but you still have the option to sort contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and it does it very well. Naturally, you can search by gradual typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact employs a tabbed interface that?s well known to anyone that has used a Sony Ericsson handset in the past couple of years. There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and finally the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you can add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: bad signal reception<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Yari unit we tested had poor signal reception and the line was constantly dropping when the signal was low. The call volume even at the highest setting is very quiet. Overall, the Yari doesn?t score very high in what should be its primary function ? phone calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yari offers videocall functionality thanks to its secondary camera, but that?s a small consolation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing or ?Smart Search? as Sony Ericsson call it, is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed Call Log application should be familiar too if you've used a fairly recent Sony Ericsson handset. It displays in four tabs, including All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to or from a single contact, only the last one gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our traditional speakerphone test with Sony Ericsson Yari scored a Very Good mark. You should have no problems hearing it in all but the noisiest environments. The vibration strength was quite low however. Here is how it compares to some of the other handsets we have tested. You can find information on the actual testing process, along with the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari handles all common types of messages, all of which - save for emails - share a common inbox. The phone also supports push email but can't handle any documents that are attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of a document reader.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like all the recent Sony Ericsson phones, the Sony Ericsson Yari has enhanced message sorting - the so-called Conversations mode, a.k.a. Threaded messaging. We missed a preinstalled IM client though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going back to Conversations mode - it is the alternative conversation-style layout and displays messages in threads. The SMS communication with a certain contact is organized in speech bubbles much like in an instant messenger program.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, the Sony Ericsson Yari also offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact. Each message can also be sorted into one of six categories - Business, Favorites, Follow Up, Fun, Holiday, Important ? but you can create new categories as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email application failed to retrieve the settings for our Gmail account automatically ? by now we?re used to the phones doing most of that work for us. On the upside, the app supports push notifications ? when you set up a push-enabled email account, the Yari will ask you if you want to receive push notifications. Click Yes and you?re all set up ? at least that worked great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari also offers the proprietary Manage Email feature, which is the equivalent of Manage Messages, but for email (duh!). You can arrange messages by email address, date or size, and copy them to either the phone memory or the memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Media Center is a winner<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari runs the flash-based Media Center. Its menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, Games, RSS feeds and Settings icons. As we've already said, there's an accelerometer on board so auto screen rotation can be activated if needed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Music Player to be found in Yari is version 3.0 - a slightly abridged edition of Walkman player 3.0. Across the Media Center menus, you can enjoy screen auto-rotation. The player supports numerous file formats, including the regularly used MP3, WAV, WMA, M4A and E-AAC plus the MegaBass equalizer preset and Stereo widening. The player can naturally be set to run in the background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface colors of the Media center vary across different themes. The Walkman player on the Yari also offers fun Styles ? skins that change the look of the player into a vinyl record player, a reel-to-reel tape player, CD player and others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no shake control however, despite the built-in accelerometer. It was quite a hip feature ? you could skip songs or even shuffle the playlist by just a flick of the hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A familiar Walkman goodie, SensMe, offers a different approach to populating a playlist. It automatically generates playlists based on what tempo and what mood you want ? fast or slow, sad or happy. Songs need to be tagged, which is only possible with the Sony Ericsson?s PC software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is also present ? it analyzes the currently playing song on the radio or whatever it picks up with its mic and tells you the performer and name of the song.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Images<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery stores the shots you've taken along with the pre-bundled wallpapers. Luckily, auto rotation is available so you can still rotate images to landscape orientation not only manually but automatically as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images are generally displayed as a 3 x 4 grid of thumbs. The shots in the dedicated Camera Album are sorted by the date they were taken on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening an image makes the thumb zoom in to fullscreen view mode, while exiting the fullscreen view zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Photo gallery can get quite laggy when there are a lot of photos in a folder. Sometimes, the phone froze for a couple of seconds before moving on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari sports an inbuilt GPS receiver and it can geotag camera images. Then, you can use the View on map option in the image gallery. It allows you to check the place where the shot has been taken directly on the map using the preinstalled Google Maps application (data charges may apply).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does subtitles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player in the Media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, and the interface is simple and stylish. The video files are accessible via the file manager too. Display mode automatically switches when the phone is rotated. It supports the MP4 and 3GP video formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player can also show subtitles, it handles the .SRT format. Subtitles are displayed against black background. We wish this was more customizable ? options like text size, background opacity and so on would have been nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video section also houses the pre-installed YouTube client, which gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarked favorites and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of the Sony Ericsson Yari has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has a nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flawless audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari audio quality is near perfect with spot-on frequency response and no weak spots whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Almost every area of the Yari performance is top-notch and comparable to the best in class. It's the best Sony Ericsson we have seen to date and certainly one of the best handsets altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table and graph below so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>You can find more info about the testing procedure and more results here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>5 megapixel shooter with no contrast<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you already know by now, the Sony Ericsson Yari has a 5 megapixel camera capable of producing images with a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. The handset is equipped with an LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5 megapixel autofocus camera offers a wide range of niceties such as smile shutter, face detection, macro mode, spot metering, image geo-tagging, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has the familiar user interface. Its pop-up sub-menus enhanced with icons and the Multi Menu packing all the available settings are here to facilitate the user. The game keys also come into play here ? the lower key (when the phone is held in landscape orientation) switches between the available scenes, and the upper key toggles the flash. In video mode they toggle Night mode and the Video light respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera toolbar gives access to shoot mode, scenes, picture size, focus, flash, self-timer, metering mode, white balance, effects, and settings Multi Menu. An ISO setting is not available in the Yari.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The focus mode has an extra feature - Face detection. The face recognition system allows you to simultaneously track as many as 3 faces but focus is locked on the one that's closest to the center of the frame when the image is captured.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using Smile Shutter is easy - first you fully press the camera key all the way down to activate it. A small blinking yellow icon in the right upper corner indicates that the mode is on and the phone will automatically snap the photo as soon as it "spots" a grinning face.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony EricssonYari is capable of putting standard GPS coordinates in images thanks to the built-in GPS receiver. You can enable geotagging (Add position) from the settings to add GPS location data to your pictures. A flag icon at the bottom of the viewfinder indicates that the option is activated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated macro mode in the Yari allows you to take images from just a couple of centimeters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer the camera is also able to auto-rotate your images when you are previewing them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is one shortcoming that concerns the one-way camera menu layout - to reach the Multi Menu you have to pass all the other settings on the toolbar as it's the last item there. Looped scrolling of items on the toolbar should be an option, as with the camera interfaces of competing brands.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the Sony Ericsson Yari has a problem ? the contrast is way too low, which makes the photos look washed out. The amount of noise is low, but even if you fix the contrast in an image-editing program, there would still be some detail lost. Between that and the noise reduction algorithm, most of the fine details are smeared away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either way, you?d need to do some post-processing on the photos before you can show them to your friends. The built-in PhotoFix option doesn?t cut it (in fact, it makes things worse) and there?s no PhotoDJ app for manual adjustments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Sony Ericsson Yari. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Yari is also capable of capturing video - VGA resolution at 30fps. You can use the LED flash in the video recording and the clips are recorded in MP4 format.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video suffers from the same general lack of contrast, but otherwise stacks up pretty well against the VGA-recording crowd. There are compression artifacts and the occasional doubled frame, but unfortunately this seems to be the current norm in the mobile phone world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video (VGA@30fps) for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Midrange connectivity for a midrange handset<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari scores average on connectivity options. Quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and 3G (two versions ? one dual-band and one tri-band for the Americas) are all on board as is HSDPA (3.6Mbps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the network-based connectivity, the Sony Ericsson Yari offers the usual Bluetooth v2.0 and USB options, though you?d need a Sony Ericsson Fast Port to USB cable. There is also support for the A2DP profile allowing you to listen to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there?s the hot swappable microSD card ? it is the fastest way to transfer large amounts of data. The easy access to the card and the microSD card reader in the box leave no excuses for not using this option.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browsing is good enough for a non-touch phone<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Yari comes with the nice Access NetFront web browser v3.5 featuring the extended home screen, also available in the other recent Sony Ericsson handsets. Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen right under a search and an address bar. The appearance of the home screen changes to various bright colors each time you start the browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Elaborate web pages are rendered well and there are lots of configurable settings too. There is a full screen mode both in portrait and landscape view. Auto-rotation works like a charm and the panning/scrolling speed is up to scratch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari web browser offers a virtual mouse pointer that?s nice to work with. For YouTube, you have a dedicated application, which launches automatically when you try to view a YouTube video. There is also support for RSS feeds and on-page search, copying text or downloading pictures off a page are not a problem for the Yari browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We experienced some lags in the interface of the browser however. Nothing major, nor too common, but still noticeable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari offers a wide range of time-management features as usual for its class. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Java Applications, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Calculator and Torch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts you to add it to the calendar too. There is just one general-purpose type of entry in the Calendar, but it features enough details. Notes are composed similar to messages and the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms application hardly needs any detailing. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari comes preinstalled with some of the usual apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Walk Mate is a step counter, which challenges you to achieve a healthy goal ? walk a thousand steps. Music Quiz tests your knowledge of songs - it plays samples of your music library and asks you to name the song.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PullFace 2 and Voice Transformer are two fun little apps. PullFace lets you snap a photo and play with it ? you can use several image distortion tools to twist a photo into a funny cartoon. Voice Transformer is the corresponding app for sound ? you record a sound and then you can apply various effects ? robot, play it backwards, high/low pitch, drunk and so on. When you?re done, the app saves the sound as a WAV file (mp3 would have been much more useful though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a regular sound recorder as well, which records AMR files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also use two preinstalled apps as wallpaper ? the first is Walk Mate, the other is Calendar Wallpaper, which puts an analog clock on the wallpaper. Using the built in accelerometer, you can switch to other views ? calendar, tasks and last photo.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Games ? take that Project Natal for Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari is not strictly a gamer?s phone but it puts a fresh new spin on mobile gaming. The gaming keys and the Game Carousel are just a part of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, there are the typical D-pad controlled games like FIFA 10, Guitar Rock Tour, Bubble Town, NitroStreet Racing, and Quadrapop. We?ve reviewed these games before, so we?ll skip them and get straight to the news.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari comes with two motion based games preinstalled ? Bowling and LocoRoco.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bowling is a small but fantastic game using the motion sensor. Choose your position, direction and then swing with your hand and watch what happens. It's great fun and you can play in tournaments with your friends.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LocoRoco follows the adventure of a blob-like creature. By tilting the phone, you have to guide it through hills and valleys, even tunnels. LocoRoco is a fun physics-based game and is very kid-friendly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for the piece de resistance ? the gesture-controlled games. The gestures are performed without touching the phone ? you put the phone in its stand and move your hands or entire body to control the games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two gesture-controlled games preinstalled ? Tennis and Fitness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Tennis game you control the serve and shots. To serve, you swing your hand forward and then back. To return a shot you swing your hand left or right ? it doesn?t really matter as forehand or backhand are chosen automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Arrows show up on the screen to indicate the direction in which you need to swing your hand and the best moment to do it. That turns Tennis into a sort of rhythm game. The sensitivity is good enough and doesn?t take long to get used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fitness is much simpler but, like with Walk Mate, the point is the exercise more than the complexity of the game. There are three modes ? The Squat, Repetitive Side Step and Yoga.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Again you put the phone on the stand and follow the instructions ? there?s nothing overly complicated. As the name implies, you either squat or side step. The Yoga portion requires you to do the Vrksasana pose (a.k.a. Tree Pose) and hold your balance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There you have it ? the method of control is quite innovative and promises to be the ?next big thing? after motion control (like the Nintendo Wii). But the games themselves are not very impressive ? even Tennis doesn?t quite hold up to the Wii version, perhaps because the accelerometer in the Wii Remote is a lot more accurate than the motion capture on the Sony Ericsson Yari.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the motion-controlled games ? Bowling and LocoRoco ? they can be quite fun for an impromptu bowling tournament or to entertain children.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>?But what about the gaming keys?? you?re probably wondering. Well, just one of the preinstalled games uses them - FIFA 10. That hardly justifies putting dedicated gaming keys.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation costs too much<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari features a built-in GPS receiver. Its sensitivity is decent enough and with A-GPS enabled, it managed to acquire a lock almost instantaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yari is equipped with Wisepilot navigation software and offers all the features you'd expect in a proper SatNav solution. There's voice-guided walk and drive navigation, maps are courtesy of NAVTEQ, there's 3D view of the maps, extensive route-planning settings, speed camera alerts, POI and weather. SatNav software is a big plus for every feature phone, because installing one is near impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its main downside is that maps are not stored locally but instead are downloaded over the air. A flat data fee is recommended but 1MB of data should get you about 600km of navigation. Still, we would have liked to have a map downloader as well, like with Nokia Maps. It really would have helped in avoiding data roaming charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also wish there was a built-in compass like on most of its competitors to facilitate navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wisepilot for Sony Ericsson comes with 30-days trial period, beginning the first time you start the app. After this month expires you will need a subscription ? 3 months for Europe will set you back 27.95 euro and for North America for 3 months it?s 27.95 US dollars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After Nokia released their Ovi Maps with full voice-guided navigation for free that seems way too expensive. For almost 30 euro for 3 months we at least expected to get to download the maps, because paying the data charges (especially when roaming) really ramps up the price of the whole thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is included as well if you prefer it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Tracker application that tracks your route as you exercise ? jogging, running or bicycling. You can view your previous routes as well as a summary, which includes things like Total, Average or Best lap time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were very excited about the Sony Ericsson Yari when we started the review. The camera-tracked gesture control combined with accelerometer action is a move in the right direction for gaming ? just look at the sales of the Nintendo Wii compared to PlayStation 3 for example (and the Wii just uses an accelerometer-enabled controller, it can?t do the camera gesture trick).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the more advanced of the two preinstalled games ? Tennis ? has the equivalent to two buttons for control ? one to press and release to serve and another to press when the game prompts you to hit the ball. While using the camera instead of physical buttons is impressive, the game itself is simpler than Guitar Hero ? and you don?t get Rock Band style multiplayer fun either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the primary camera was quite a surprise ? an unpleasant surprise. From the makers of impressive Cybershot cameraphones, not tweaking the camera contrast is a major blunder. The weak signal reception and poor keypad mean that the Yari doesn?t do so well as a phone either. And what?s with the gaming keys that have such limited use?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there were some high points ? the Sony Ericsson Yari could easily live up to the Walkman series name, though it isn?t officially part of that range. And SatNav navigation for feature phones is hard to come by, even if you?re willing to pay for it. The push email support is a great feature, though we would have liked a preinstalled IM client too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari is not a very expensive phone so maybe we shouldn?t be too hard on it ? after all, it offers a great package for the price. But let?s see what it?s up against.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia 6260 slide is an equal to the Yari in price and specs though it does have Wi-Fi, to get ahead of the Yari. It?s an older device and hardly a looker, nor does it have the gesture and accelerometer controlled games.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it?s looks that you?re after, then the Nokia 6700 classic is a great option. It?s a bit more expensive than the Yari, but its solid metal body and top-of-the-line 5MP camera should make up for that difference. And because it?s not a slider, it?s much thinner than the Yari.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia 6260 slide ? Nokia 6700 classic</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S7350 Ultra s is similar in specs, but can be found quite cheaply ? 140 euro is not uncommon and we even managed to find it for as low as 100 euro (140 dollars). If you stumbled upon such a bargain, would you pass it up?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Have a look at the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH too ? for a premium you get an AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, 8MP camera with mighty impressive video recording plus DivX/XviD support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung S7350 Ultra s ? Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Yari will certainly find its supporters ? despite its drawbacks it sure is a looker, especially the Metal Rose and Cranberry White variants, and the gesture-based games may be a bit of a gimmick but they?re still quite impressive the first time you see them. Reasonably priced and reasonably skilled is what it takes to do well in the midrange. But the Yari sure stands out for its willingness to experiment.</paragraph>
