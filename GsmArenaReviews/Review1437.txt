			<subsectionTitle>Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab is Samsung?s move onto the tablet warfield and luckily we are right here in the battle fray to give you first-hand scoop from the announcement event. Some might argue that it?s rather a step down from laptops but the Samsung Galaxy Tab smartphone DNA is obvious from the moment you touch it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 7-inch Android tablet has full phone functionality and the only thing that separates it from being called an insanely oversized cell phone is the fact that you cannot make phone calls by holding it next to your ear. The rest of the specs sheet looks like it belongs to a cell phone if you don?t mind the oversized screen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>However the Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab specs don?t have the privilege to be considered in isolation. With the biggest player in the tablet world also belonging to the phone OS tablet category, the Tab will always be compared to it. The Apple iPad has quite a head start and it will be hard for a newcomer to steal the spotlight, but so was the iPhone back in the day and that didn?t stop Samsung from trying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So here?s a brief look at what the two big guns hold as advantages over each other.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPad over Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There?s something we would like to highlight in the lists above. The first items in each of them turn this into a choice between handling and functionality (because a tablet?s main feature is its screen), which boils down to picking your priorities, rather than picking the better of two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that leads us to suspect that it may not be a battle for survival between those two. There might just be a spot in the sun for both of those cool gadgets after all. But it?s still too early to tell as we have a whole lot of touching to do before we make any conclusions. And even if those two do eventually settle in their own corners of the ring, punches will fly quite heavily at one stage or another.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let?s not waste any more time and see what the Galaxy Tab does in real life. After all specs are a good place to start but they don?t even begin to tell the whole story.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The design of the Samsung Galaxy Tab was certainly one of the most surprising things that its announcements brought. The final version of the tablet has nothing to do with the iPad clones that the leaked prototypes were. You can probably see reviews of those all over the Internets today - but just so you be sure - if you see they've got a Galaxy Tab with a silver back and sides, it's an early prototype, even software wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead the final Galaxy Tab employs a new design where the sides match the color of the front, rather than the back panel and the body is curved in the opposite direction. And the result is really sleek despite the all-plastic construction. The white back panel is really sleek and surprisingly fingerprint resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic body also brings another advantage ? it lowers the Galaxy Tab overall weight to an easily holdable 380 grams. Of course it?s much heavier than any phone, but feels feather light next to the iPad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Samsung Galaxy Tab is mostly about the 7? WSVGA (1024 x 600 pixels) LCD touchscreen. It has great picture quality for an LCD unit and even though the contrast isn?t quite as impressive as the SuperAMOLED units it?s good enough to rival the iPad. Of course the higher, 192 ppi density also helps here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However when it comes to viewing angles the Galaxy Tab seems to be a bit behind the Apple tablet. We will need to do a side by side comparison of the two units to see the margin of its defeat but it seems the colors get distorted at a smaller angle than on the iPad. This is not to say that you are unable to see the Galaxy Tab display from small angles ? the colors might be false but the image is all there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the Samsung Galaxy Tab touchscreen is simply superb but that is hardly any news when talking about a capacitive unit. It may make styluses and gloves a no-no but every single touch of your bare fingers is sure to be registered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display we find four capacitive touch buttons. Those include back, home, context menu and dedicated search keys. They are all large enough and pose no obstacles to usability. And since the keys use the same technology as the screen, using both is as smooth as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right hand side (assuming portrait is its default position) of the Galaxy Tab is quite busy. Samsung has placed the volume rocker and the power/screen lock keys there as well as the SIM card and microSD slots. There are small plastic lids covering the two card slots so dust and dirt accumulation is far less likely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The same cannot be said about the 3.5mm jack, which is the only functional element that?s located on the top of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left is also pretty bare with the microphone pinhole the only thing of interest. It?s located near the top so it?s harder to muffle it with your fingers when holding the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Samsung Galaxy Tab is where the stereo speakers and the 30-pin connector are located. The company did consider placing a standard microUSB port instead, but that wouldn?t allow accessories such as HDMI cables to be plugged there, so they went for the proprietary connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We conclude our trip at the back where we find the 3.2 megapixel camera and its LED flash. We got quite curious as to why Samsung didn?t include a higher-res shooter as it wouldn?t have increased the price that much (and certainly wouldn?t have bloated the body notably).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery of the Samsung Galaxy Tab is not user removable. In case you need to change it, you'd have to visit a Samsung Service center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It turns out that Samsung never considered the Galaxy Tab as a device that you can use to take photos all the time. Instead they placed the camera as a tool that enables more apps to run on the Galaxy Tab. There are plenty of apps in the Android market that need the camera to work and that?s the main reason why the snapper is there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the hood lays a 4000 mAh battery that according to Samsung is good for 7 hours of video playback (we are assuming SD content here). This doesn?t sound bad at all but the iPad does 10 hours of that on a bigger screen so it?s not quite great either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general impression of the Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab hardware is very positive. The display is quite good, the controls are large enough and there are generally no ergonomics blunders. We are sorry they had to go with a proprietary connectivity port but at least that would allow HDMI output (via optional cable), which makes good sense on a 1080p DivX-capable device. Our geeky souls however would have been happier with a higher-res (8MP or so) camera with HD video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Tab handles great in general for which contribute its slim profile, narrow bezel and light weight. It is also pretty compact and you might even be able to squeeze it in a wider pocket now and then. This is all, of course, only true if you look at it as a tablet. If you want it to replace your phone on the other hand, things look quite differently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you've probably heard, Samsung has a nice set of accessories ready for the Galaxy Tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Okay, so now that we have the hardware covered we?ll see what the Galaxy Tab has to offer on the software side of things. Join us after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab runs version 2.2 of the Android OS or otherwise said Froyo. However Samsung are taking a somewhat different approach here - they haven't done their TouchWiz magic to the homescreen or the main menu as they did with the Galaxy S.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Instead here they have focused their efforts in customizing some of the apps and bringing their own widgets to the homescreen. We are hoping that this way Samsung will be able to bring future Android updates to the Galaxy Tab quicker as redesigning single applications should be much easier than rewriting a full UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The selection of apps for the Galaxy Tab is quite extensive. Naturally, most of them are just automatically upscaled versions of existing apps, but since the screen isn't too huge and it isn't actually necessary to do too much upscaling (WVGA has just over 60 percent of the WSVGA pixel count) you can't really see any irritating pixelization.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the user interface, the Samsung Galaxy Tab offers three docked shortcuts and up to nice planes worth of space for you to fill with widgets and shortcuts. By default the docked shortcuts open the application drawer, the web browser and the email client. The main menu shortcut is there to stay but you can change the other two as you see fit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going into editing mode on the homescreen is pretty easy - you just pinch-zoom out and you can start adding, removing and reordering panes. You can do the exact same thing in the main menu by the way, but rearranging is your only option there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a hands-on video showing editing the menu panes, as well as the music player and gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two of the Android handsets key features, the notification area and the Task switcher, haven't seen much change. The task switcher icon count has been raised to 8 by Froyo but that's basically all. Not that they need much change as they are doing their job just fine anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance is generally great - the 1GHz CPU obviously does a great job at keeping the things blazingly fast. Not that we expected something else from a chip that is capable of playing Full HD video seamlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a hands-on video:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>This is certainly one of the most interesting features of the Galaxy Tab. Not because every user will be using the tablet for calls non-stop, but because it's interesting to see how Samsung implemented it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we are pleased to say that the South Korean company did a great job with it. You can talk on the phone using the built in microphone and loudspeaker, you can plug in a pair of headphones and use only the microphone or you can attach a handsfree and use its built-in mic instead. The even better news is there will also be a handsfree supplied in the retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth handsfree units are also compatible with the Samsung Galaxy Tab. And with the front-facing 1.3 MP videocall camera the capabilities of the device are basically as good as they get. Okay, you cannot hold the device next to your ear and talk in it but that's all you are missing and it would look ridiculous anyway.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned Samsung have customized several of the apps on the Galaxy Tab to make better use of the increased screen estate and resolution. The most notable changes concern the email, which has an iPad-like interface (the list of emails goes on the left and the currently selected one is previewed on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are free to change the size of the two columns (i.e. expand one at the expense of the other) as you see fit, much like on a desktop email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice touch to the email client is the shortcut for alternating different mailboxes and the option to display all you mails together (with color codes so you know where each one came from).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SNS-friendly phonebook packs an interface similar to the email client, only it doesn't allow you to alter the column sizes. On the left you get a list of your contacts and on the right appear the details on the currently selected one. You also get shortcut buttons to check their Twitter, Facebook or MySpace updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another totally redesigned key app is the calendar. The different view modes are on top and you can browse it based on the selected mode (dates, weeks, months) by sliding at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also added Music hub and Reader hub apps to the Galaxy Tab, which allow you to quickly find samples and than purchase and consume music tracks, newspapers, magazines and e-books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we are going to mention the camera. As you might have noticed from one of the short demo videos, its interface is pretty simple and convenient. Samsung know how to make a good touch-driven camera interface and this one is no exception. They have reduced the number of customizable options quite drastically but as we already said the camera is not quite a key feature by itself here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video showing the video player and camera interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab is one pretty sleek device that suits its intended purpose perfectly. It's not running a proper desktop OS so those of you that hoped to throw away their laptops or netbooks after purchasing the Galaxy Tab are in no luck.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the Galaxy Tab delivers impressively smooth performance and allows you to stay in touch on the go, which as it turns out is what a huge number of people really want. Plus if you are willing to live with the size it can fully replace your mobile phone but that's a long shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At any rate Samsung have managed to pull an Apple stunt here and have created a device that doesn't do everything but performs greatly in everything it does. The company has of course also been helped by the rapid development of the Android OS, which is arguably the most user-friendly and functional mobile OS right now (and until the iPad gets iOS 4 it will certainly rule the tablet world).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have also managed to add enough in terms of new features to compensate for the iPad headstart and have come up with a innovative and sleek design. However we are still getting the feeling that with the size and weight difference between those two there will be enough room for both of them to co-exist happily on the market. Different people have different needs and those two cater for two different groups of customers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultimately it will be the pricing that will decide the Galaxy Tab fate, but Samsung have a great record in that area really so we hope they will stay reasonable here too. Plus they are promising availability through a vast number of carriers so chances are you will get the chance to snap the Tab at a subsidized rate as well.</paragraph>
