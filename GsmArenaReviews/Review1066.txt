			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG G5's modularity is the highlight of the company's G5 flagship but is actually more to it. The LG G5 has a few accessories, called LG Friends, which will make your experience complete. They were announced alongside the G5 in Barcelona and were meant to really complete the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With mid-range smartphones offering more and more polished experience, many companies have turned to accessories to serve as a differentiator of their top dogs and LG hopes to deliver the most interesting lineup there. It offers an entire series of exclusive gadgets, dubbed Friends, which we've listed below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G5 Friends:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are a few nice options that you may want to connect to the LG G5 right from the beginning, while third-party G5 modules should be coming later this year as well. That said the success of the whole thing largely depends on how successful LG is in committing 3rd party makers to the concept, which in turn will certainly depend on the initial market success of the G5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG was kind enough to send us some of the Friends, while we saw others at the MWC expo so we have the full picture for you. We'll start dissecting the lineup of modules on the next page.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Cam Plus module for LG G5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first extension is the LG Cam Plus camera grip. It adds extra 1,200mAh of battery capacity, and hardware camera controls: shutter key, a camcorder button, camera on/off button and a zoom dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapping the the module is very easy, but you have to detach and reattach your original battery, which requires a restart of the phone. Luckily the G5 is one of the fastest booting phones around so at least it doesn't take too much time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The module, being a replacement for the bottom of your phone, also houses a USB Type-C port, a microphone, a loudspeaker, and some antennas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It works as expected - the slider at the bottom fires up the camera, while the two-step camera shutter focuses and takes pictures. The small key next to the shutter starts up video recording immediately. The added grip at the back is great and helps you feel the LG G5 secure in hand when shooting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the zoom dial while in photo mode is quite a unique experience. Thanks to its dual camera setup the LG G5 offers a unique hybrid zoom - starting with digital zoom from the wide camera and switching to the normal one when you reach that point. After that you are again left with regular digital zoom, and you should better steer clear of that..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The zoom dial is quite loose, doesn't provide any tactile feedback, which isn't working in its favor. We've seen better and we hoped LG will fix this in the retail units, but unfortunately it didn't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While you are using the LG Cam Plus, the Quick Charge option is disabled as the charge goes through the module's integrated battery. The charging is the opposite of quick - it can pass 5V/0.5A or 9V/0.5A current towards the G5's own battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is the LG Cam Plus charges your battery for about 5 minutes upon clicking any of its button. It doesn't act as a power bank; it just sends a small charge to your main battery in order to restore what was taken while you were shooting images/videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news is - if you don't have enough battery for shooting, the extra 1,200 mAh will barely help you keep the phone alive, let alone take more than few shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Cam Plus wasn't designed to stay long in your LG G5 and we recommend using it only when needed. It extends your power autonomy and boosts the grip, but compromises charging and the design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keen photographers will appreciate the extra grip and controls, but we have to disappoint those of you hoping to use it as a power bank - it doesn't work that way and has a rather damaging effect on pocketability.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&amp;O Play for LG G5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The second module initially available for the LG G5 Magic Slot is the LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&amp;O Play. It's a 32-bit Hi-Fi DAC and Amp designed to enhance your audio experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The audio module has a Sabre ES9028C2M DAC and a Sabre 9602c amp - a combo quite similar to LG V10's audio hardware. The software and the module's design are B&amp;O work, and you can notice the piece is slightly larger than the original G5 cap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the LG Cam Plus, the Hi-Fi Plus needs your original battery in order to work with the LG G5 and it has an integrated mic, loudspeaker, and an embedded antenna. The Hi-Fi Plus module comes with its own 3.5mm audio Hi-Fi port, and an USB Type-C port to be used for charging the LG G5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The B&amp;O module is universal for all LG G5 paintjobs - it's made of matte black plastic, so it goes equally well with any G5 flavor (but doesn't exactly match any of them). There is a small brushed B&amp;O logo at the center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Hi-Fi Plus can work as a standalone DAC and AMP, too. Just place the cap on the top, and you have a complete external audio device with a secondary USB Type-C port used for connection to other devices such as phones, slates, and PCs. LG has bundled a proper USB Type-C to microUSB OTG cable, so you are ready to use it right out of the box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is a small black leather B&amp;O pouch, so you can carry the gadget safely. It's a nice touch and kudos to LG and B&amp;O for walking the extra mile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, what this thing can do? No matter if you use it on another device or inserted in the LG G5, the Hi-Fi Plus module does two things - plays your 24/32-bit Hi-Fi content via its dedicated 3.5mm audio port (over speakers or headphones), or it can upscale and upsample lower quality audio so it can play close to its originally intended sound. It's a software enhancement though so don't expect great results - your low-quality tracks will still sound pretty badly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you do have high-quality audio you will need some proper speakers or headphones to enjoy the excellent sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried the Hi-Fi Plus on the Galaxy S7 edge and the Huawei P9 and it worked hassle-free. Connecting it to PC is a fairly simple affair too even if it requires some extra time - Windows will automatically install the driver, or you'll have to get it manually from lg.com.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As expected the LG Hi-Fi Plus with B&amp;O Play delivers top marks for audio clarity no matter if you are plugging an active external amp or a pair of headphones. The stereo crosstalk is kept low, while the loudness is above the average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we are to compare it with the LG G5 output - the extension delivers louder sound, with deeper bass levels, and quite expectedly - wider dynamic range. It isn't the best DAC you can buy though, and considering the high price, you should opt for this only if you will be using it on the LG G5 and with a proper pair of headphones. For any other case, we suggest you shop around first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, using it on a PC requires for you to install a special driver (navigate to the fifth tab and scroll down). Then you will get a control panel for the upsampling options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It does improve the quality over the LG G5 and most of the audiophiles will be able to tell it even with cheaper headphones, but we are not sure if its high price tag serves it right.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG 360 CAM<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the actual Friends, the spherical LG 360 CAM is the easiest and cheapest way to produce your own VR content on the go. If you want to create and share YouTube 360 videos, that's the thing you'll need. It's a tiny device with dual 13MP sensors, each behind a super-wide (200-degree) fisheye lens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 360 CAM records 2560x1280 videos, and the content can be viewed on any Cardboard and YouTube 360 compatible device. It has a 1,200mAh battery for up to 70 minutes of video recording on a charge. It supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi pairing with the smartphone. Finally, this small cam weighs just 72 grams.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG 360 camera can also capture and upload multimedia content to Google Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 360 CAM comes bundled with a USB Type-C cable and a protective cap. The latter also doubles as a camera holder, which is helpful if you don't want your hand to take a quarter of the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a standard tripod mount at the bottom, right next to the cap protecting the USB port and the microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG 360 CAM has just two keys - an on/off switch on one of the sides and a shutter key below one of the camera sensors. A click on the shutter key captures a 180 or a 360-degree photo (there is a LED indication around the off switch to remind you what photos you are snapping), while a tap and hold kicks off the spherical video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Connecting the LG 360 CAM to compatible smartphones (most recent Android devices and iPhones) is easy - you need to install the LG Friends Manager and from there download and install the LG 360 CAM app. The app is simple enough - it lets you configure the photo mode (360 or 180 degree) and choose the video quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is also useful for its real-time viewfinder and remote control over the 360 CAM. It can also preview all photos inside the 360 CAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 360 CAM is probably the most compact 360-degree camera on the market, especially compared to Samsung's Gear 360. LG did a good job designing the thing - it's lightweight and portable, and provides a secure grip. It could easily be attached to a selfie stick, which many will appreciate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Snapping photos is a click away. Viewing them on the LG G5 or another Android smartphone is equally fast. The quality isn't impressive, but given that the resolution is distributed over such a large viewing field and the reasonable asking price we didn't expect miracles. And while the captured detail is a mixed bag, the stitching is very good, and so are the contrast and colors (even if they are a little too saturated).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening those 360-degree shots via a PhotoSphere player makes things better - the images look very pleasant when run through such a program and the preview on devices like the Samsung's Gear VR that we had at hand is equally nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here - try the spheres below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see the 360 shots are quite interesting. You can view them through spherical viewers or VR players. They do the job to capture the entire place and its spirit into one very nice VR scene. While the quality could have been a bit better, we believe the 360 CAM is an excellent tool for capturing memories.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG 360 CAM is capable of capturing 2560 x 1280 pixel spherical videos, 1280 x 1280 for each side. The video quality is worse than the still pictures, and the stitching isn't nearly as good. Even though we aren't impressed with the quality of the captured videos, we still like the results. They can be quite valueable on specific occasions - beach sports, sea travels, helicopter rides, parades, or concerts. Especially with the option to record 5.1 sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in conclusion the LG 360 CAM might not be the perfect VR camera, but it certainly has the potential to become the most popular one. LG got its size, affordable price and ease of use right, and that should be enough to the majority of the target audience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG 360 VR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG 360 VR headset is quite compact and very portable, and it doesn't require you to attach your handset at its front to use its screen. You still need to plug your phone, mind you, so it powers the headset and stream the content but it can sit comfortably in the pocket of your jeans.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 360 VR has a setup of dual 1.88" displays, each of 960 x 720 pixels. The 360 VR is compatible with Google's Cardboard app and YouTube 360 multimedia content. Unfortunately, the image quality is far from what the competition has to offer - it's much more pixelated and not as immersing as the Gear VR with a, say, Galaxy S7. Then again it's one of the cheapest standalone VR headsets around, so there is that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, the 360 VR is small and lightweight, but its metal bracket fitting the nose is uncomfortable and may render the headset unusable for some. After half an hour of use the metal nose pad left its mark on our noses, as did the temples around the ears.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG 360 VR still does a very good job in displaying the content shot with the LG 360 CAM, or other 360-degree snappers, as well as playing online VR multimedia or games. Just don't hold your breath over picture quality or comfort - both had to cut some corners in order to keep the targeted $200 price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The problem is that even so, the Samsung Gear VR costs half as much and offers better fit and more controls. Not to mention the partnership with Oculus, which greatly expands the available content, which is a pretty big deal at this early point. Then again, the Gear VR only works with a handful of Samsung flagship so it's not an option to everyone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG Rolling Bot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have to admit this little fella caught our attention at the MWC the most. Not because it's a groundbreaking or market-shaping gadget, but simply because it's impressively cool. The bot is 20cm in diameter, with an integrated 8MP camera (it can move up and down by up to 15-degrees), loudspeaker, a microphone, infra-red sensor, a couple of LEDs, and of course, the ability to move around your house all by itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rolling Bot can fully monitor your house and live stream everything that's happening real-time, with sound. There is a microSD card slot to record video and pictures, if you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then it can control all of your appliances - TVs, sound systems, air conditioners, the lot. If something can be controlled via an IR remote, then the LG Rolling Bot should be able to operate it whether you are home or not. You give a command, and the Bot relays it to the appliance of your choosing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, this Rolling Bot, thanks to its camera, speaker, and mic, can help you interact with your pets even when you are not home. We thought it would have been nice if the Bot also featured a hologram projector, but those are a few years away at this point so let's not get greedy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that a few months have passed since the Rolling Bot was announced, there are quite a few similar gadgets on the way. The coolest of those is probably the Sphero BB-8, coming from the latest Star Wars movie. It does similar things, costs about ?150 and is double the coolness, because Star Wars.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Tone Platinum<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, LG Tone Platinum are new wireless headphones LG is now selling. It is tuned by Harman Kardon to a "Platinum" sound grade and delivers 24-bit Hi-Fi audio through a Qualcomm aptX HD audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a catch though - you can get this 24-bit Hi-Fi audio output only via the LG G5, but other devices with the same Qualcomm aptX HD audio codec might work as well. If such thing isn't available on your device, then the quality will depend solely on its codec capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a dual setup of microphones for noise cancellation and voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tone Platinum Headset is beautifully designed and is built with high quality materials, including metal. It offers dedicated call and volume controls, on/off switch, multimedia controls, and battery indicator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have a rather positive experience with the previous Tone wireless headphones, and we know the Tone Platinum will be worth the hefty price tag for those looking to play Hi-Fi sound though Bluetooth. And if you own the LG G5, you won't be needing the B&amp;O module with the Tone Platinum, as those work wirelessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you aren't after the Hi-Fi sound, some of the previous Tone models will do you just as good at a fraction of the price.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We certainly appreciate LG's out-of-the-box thinking with the Friends series. A lineup of exclusive accessories is bound to add new dimensions to the LG G5 and boost its popularity. With actually useful new features on the software side increasing hard to come by, the move seems great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And if you go by the LG 360 CAM things are looking even more optimistic - the simple too for snapping spherical photos and videos would serve great for sharing memories and connecting better with your loved ones from afar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, it's mostly downhill from here. The two modules work, but target niche user groups and just aren't enough to really justify the whole "modular design" ad campaign. Even simple stuff such as the option to use the LG Cam Plus as a power bank was lost somewhere between the drawing board and the store shelves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meanwhile the Hi-Fi Plus boosts the audio experience on the G5, but you can find phones that perform just as good without needing to replace parts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 360 VR is cheap headset with integrated screen, but the uncomfortable fit and the limited experience upgrade over a simple Google Cardboard mean it's simply not worth the investment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Rolling Bot was the coolest of the Friends but it's yet to come on the market. Meanwhile many other competitors are available for purchase, and even the Star Wars BB-8. Unless you explicitly need the Bot's laser dot to fool with your cat, it might be coming to the party too late. We'll also need a price to pass judgment on that one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the LG Tone Platinum offers great audio experience once connected to the LG G5, but there's no escaping the fact that it's a very pricey headset, so having mass appeal is extremely unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So while the LG Friends idea was great, the execution is a hit and miss. We would have be more willing to forgive that if the lineup consisted of a dozen or more devices, but we are only talking two modules and three actual Friends here. Subtract the extremely niche ones and those that are yet to hit the shelves and you are left with a Cam grip and the 360 CAM - not exactly the huge expansion potential LG is trying to sell.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's hoping LG outs more and better Friends in the upcoming months, so it gives a great idea the treatment it deserves. Meanwhile delivering a few firmware updates to some of the existing ones and polishing their experience could help buy some time.</paragraph>
