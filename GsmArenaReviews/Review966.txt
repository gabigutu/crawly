			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've got something special at HQ today. The perfect Nexus phone has arrived and it looks like a Galaxy S4. This shameless poser embodies everything worth admiring from both worlds - timely updates, the unblemished stock Android experience, the highest-grade hardware money can buy and expandable storage. The Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition makes the LG-made Google Nexus 4 look like it should be in the minor league.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With one swift blow Samsung managed to create a mouth-watering Nexus smartphone, featuring some really hot hardware coupled with the latest software bundle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it makes you wonder, why did the South Koreans bother? With over 10 million Galaxy S4s shipped already, it's unlikely that the Google Play Edition S4 will make an impact, especially when you consider the high price tag and limited availability (USA-only, no subsidies). Was the idea to make good with Google or developers? Or was it just a blatant demonstration of power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In any case we're happy to just let this one slide and enjoy the fruits of the holy Samsung-Google alliance, which has brought a FullHD Super AMOLED and expandable storage to the sanctity of stock Android.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out what else you get from the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition is not for everyone. It will be the device of choice for users that need the stock software, the way Google intends it to be, but want the absolute best hardware you can get - that's a pretty exclusive group to develop a device solely for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The majority of users will likely miss the TouchWiz advancements Samsung has implemented in its software package - the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink camera app, the 50 gigs from Dropbox, the smart gestures, Adapt sound, Air View, Direct Call, the list goes on and on into eternity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But perhaps there's a silver lining - getting both sides of the fence in a single purchase. If you're willing to root your I9505 Snapdragon-powered Galaxy S4 you could simply install the stable stock Android ROM and still have the option to return to TouchWiz at a later time. It's a route only advanced users will take but it gets you everything for less - the subsidized Galaxy S4 is widely available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hallmark of the Google Play Edition Galaxy S4 is the stock Android operating system. Sure, you could always get the same experience on a Nexus 4, but you'd be losing the huge and beautiful screen, the expandable storage, the immensely-better camera and the potent chipset - and that's a lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a rare enough thing to see a product which doesn't make sense but makes you want to churn out an illogical amount of cash to get your hands on. It shoots a strong bolt of electricity through our inner geeks and makes us eager to test it, get a better feel for it, and even place it side-by-side with the Nexus 4 and start pointing bragging fingers in its direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A whole heap of unanswered questions begs for resolution. Does the more conventional physical-button design work well with stock Android? Will the camera kick ass just as it did on the TouchWiz Galaxy S4? Will the device be as fast, will the battery retain its high standards? Does the cleaner look and feel outweigh the perks up the TouchWiz version's sleeve? These and many other pressing questions deserve a thorough investigation and thankfully we've got the right men for the job. Read on for the hardware digest.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition is the exact same size as the regular Galaxy S4 - 136.6 x 69.8 mm tall and wide and it's 7.9 mm thick. It weighs the same as well at 130 grams so it looks exactly as a regular S4 - that is, until you unlock it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a very impressive feat on Samsung's part stamping a 5" display on such a thin and compact body without making it unusable. It's even more impressive when you consider there is a physical power button, which is also surrounded by two capacitive keys for menu and back. The Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition is still slightly taller than the Google Nexus 4 but offers a bigger screen without the need for on-screen buttons, which only waste the available screen real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The US Galaxy S4 aside, the Galaxy S4 GPE is identical hardware-wise to the Snapdragon-powered version of the regular S4. The GPE only comes in White Frost, so you'd be out of luck, if you are into the Black Mist color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition has... or rather, as some would argue, suffers from the same design language used for the regular Galaxy S4. The edges are curved and smooth, plastics are hyperglazed with an underlying texture, the front is entirely made out of glass and there are chrome accents around the front, the home button, the camera, the earpiece and volume rocker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even though the design's appeal has already worn off in the past year or so, the slim bezels allow the brilliant screen to really shine through, while the slim body offers a strong high-end vibe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock Android doesn't affect the usability of this Galaxy S4 in any way. The phone is still comfortable to use in one hand but users coming from a Nexus 4 would need to adjust to the physical button layout instead of the on-screen one. Ultimately, you get more screen space to work with this way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android looks great on the 1080p Super AMOLED screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Stock Android Jelly Bean on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition premiers with a new live wallpaper dubbed Sun Beam, which is the popular Phase Beam but with a warmer maroon red twist. Stock Android has never looked livelier on another display. The 5" 1920 x 1080 Super AMOLED on the Galaxy S4 just brings out the entire OS to a whole new level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are vibrant and punchy, while blacks, which are heavily used throughout the interface are pitch black. There's one thing to note, however - there are no screen modes or scenarios like in TouchWiz. You cannot choose Dynamic or Adobe RGB setups, you're stuck with the default setting. That said, the default setting is nicely balanced - it's not as oversaturated as Dynamic mode but it still packs some warmer, more saturated colors than the HTC One, for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At over 440 ppi the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition's screen looks as sharp as it gets and you can't notice the individual pixels with a naked eye. Everything is perfectly sharp down to the smallest UI item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition screen under a microscope</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness levels of the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition screen are on par with the rest of the company's AMOLEDs, which is to say, they are not very high. However, due to the screen's low reflectivity, this doesn't affect outdoor performance. Keep in mind that enabling the auto tone setting in the screen option limits the maximum brightness to under 300 nits, so if that matters to you, you better keep it off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with the rest of the S4 variations this is easily the best screen on a mobile phone today.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Since the software has been changed you should expect differences in the controls pattern of the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition. But these changes are not drastic and you'll hardly ever notice the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display you get the same three keys as on the TouchWiz Galaxy S4 - the capacitive Menu and Back buttons plus a regular Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon a long-press of the Home button you'll not be taken to the Task switcher menu but instead Google Now will be launched. In order to get to the Task switcher you need to perform a double-press of the Home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu key does exactly as advertised and opens on the contextual menu in each app or part of the OS while the back key gets you back to square one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we have the earpiece, as well as a bunch of sensors. The traditional ambient light and proximity sensors are joined by an IR gesture sensor, which doesn't really do anything with the stock software. There's also a 2.1 megapixel front-facing camera for video calls and a status LED up there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Samsung Galaxy S4 features the volume rocker, while the power/lock key is on the right - no changes there either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition features the 3.5mm audio jack, the secondary microphone and the IR blaster that allows you to use the smartphone as a remote control for your home appliances. Thankfully, the IR remote control feature is still available even without Samsung's TouchWiz enhancements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port at the bottom is used for both data connections and charging. Not only does it support USB host but it also comes with support for the new MHL 2.0, enabling 3D 1080p output and TV connections without an external power source just as the regular S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last item to point out at the bottom is the primary microphone pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition is where the 13 megapixel FullHD-capable camera lens is located. Much like on the regular Galaxy S4, the LED flash is right beside it, and the loudspeaker grille is located on the bottom left edge of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover reveals the microSIM slot, the ample 2600 mAh removable battery and the microSD card slot. The memory card slot is hot-swappable, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery test showed that the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition doesn't differ drastically from the TouchWiz Galaxy S4. It managed almost the same web browsing battery life at 7:13 hours, then it was almost a perfect match in the video playback department with 12:32 hours and finally, put out a respectable 12:37 hours in our dedicated call test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the overall endurance rating for the Galaxy S4 GPE fell from the 69 hours of the I9505 Galaxy S4 down to 63 hours because of the lesser talk-time and stand-by scores. And occasionally we would experience strange battery drain when we left the phone on stand-by overnight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 63h rating means you can expect the phone to typically last this amount of time on a single charge if you stick to our test regiment of using the phone for an hour of calling, an hour of video watching and an hour of web browsing a day and then leaving it on stand-by during the rest of the time. Of course, your mileage will vary depending on your usage pattern and network environment but still, it's our standardized way of producing comparable results across smartphones by different manufacturers.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock Android looks great in FullHD<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition comes preinstalled with Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and a new live wallpaper dubbed Sun Beam. Just by looking at it this could easily pass as a Nexus device on steroids - it's got the stock OS and everything runs perfectly smooth and fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So here's where the name-calling and finger-pointing start. Firstly, there are physical buttons on the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition. Secondly, Google has promised fast updates but they will still need to go through Samsung before they make it to the Google Play Edition S4. Thirdly, there's the matter of the expandable storage, which doesn't play nice with Google's vision of a cloud-based storage system.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But seen as how you could get the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition straight off Google Play (in the US, and for a premium) we'll go about with the software part of the review with the disposition that this is, a rare, but honest to goodness Nexus device by Google.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off this is the first time we're seeing stock Android on a FullHD scale and the first time we're seeing it coupled with Samsung's top-class Super AMOLED behind the scenes. It's exhilarating and compared to the undersaturated screen on the Nexus 4 feels a different league entirely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a UI rundown video to start you off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen in Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean features the same large dotted circle around the center-placed padlock button. Lockscreen widgets are present on the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition and are full-screen, resizable tiles, one of which is always visible at the top of the main lockscreen, above the padlock icon. The rest are a swipe to the right away. The one on the main lockscreen is collapsed to make room for the padlock button, but can be expanded to display additional information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a large variety of third-party lockscreen widgets and a few stock ones: Messages, Calendar, Gmail and Digital Clock. The camera shortcut, previously located at nine o'clock on the unlock circle is now a stand-alone widget, a swipe to the left away from the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lockscreen widgets are resizable - tap and drag down to expand and show more content, if available. Lockscreen widgets can also be reordered by tapping and dragging, so you can choose which one is visible on the main lockscreen. They can also be dragged up to discard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are multiple unlock patterns to choose from: simple slide, pattern, pin or password, and face unlock. The lockscreen could even be skipped altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once unlocked, you're welcomed with the familiar homescreen interface introduced in Ice Cream Sandwich. As the Galaxy S4 natively features a home, back and menu buttons the bottom of the screen is no longer wasted for on-screen buttons. It's up to preference but there's no doubt that on-screen virtual keys work faster and there are no mechanics involved, meaning potentially less things to get broken.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dock is customizable and features two shortcut icons on either side of the app drawer key. You can have folders there, each with multiple shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean isn't just business and no play. Google's Daydream is a fun twist on the screensaver concept. Once turned on, you can set it up to show photo albums or the latest news from Google Currents when the device is either docked or idle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the notification center you'll find Quick toggles. They're accessible via an icon in the top right corner of the notification area. You get access to key device settings such as brightness, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Battery. Some toggles are directly accessible shortcuts to their respected functions in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick settings menu can be accessed by a two-finger swipe down from the top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has added a bit of personalization to the Quick Toggle panel in the notification area. Your name and photo are displayed but only after you've logged in to Google+ or after you've manually set them yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications can be expanded and collapsed with a two-finger swipe, and the top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen consists of five panes, none to be added or removed, to fill with shortcuts, folders and widgets. More often than not, the latter are resizable in all directions in order to fit any tight space. To resize a widget, you tap and hold and then release. Four handles will appear on its sides, allowing you to change the widget's size in the direction you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders haven't been changed since Ice Cream Sandwich and function as you'd expect. A folder is created by dropping a shortcut on top of another and can be named by tapping on the "Unnamed folder" label. Opening a folder expands it only as much as needed to fit the icons inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The folders themselves are circular with the shortcuts inside drawn as if they are in a line one behind the other and you're looking at them at an angle (complete with perspective). They are lined up so the first shortcut in the folder will be the only one unobscured - the rest of the icons are nearly impossible to tell apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer of the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition consists of 4 rows of icons, instead of the Nexus 4's five. It features two tabs - Apps and Widgets, each with side-scrollable pages. If you scroll past the available apps you move into the Widgets tab. There's also a Market shortcut next to the tabs, for quicker access to Android's app repository.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps and widgets are ordered alphabetically and there's no other sorting option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing a shortcut or widget on the homescreen works as you would expect: press and hold to grab it and then position it on the homescreen pane of choice. Two more options appear at the top of the screen while you're dragging - Uninstall (to quickly remove apps) and App info, which opens the application's entry in the Manage applications list. Drop the app or widget on either one to activate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, the Recent Apps list has remained virtually unchanged, save for some optimizations in load time and a few neat animations here and there. It all adds up as a really polished user experience and feels fantastic. It would be nice if Google adds a kill/close all option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's where Google's Project Butter comes into play. We've covered it already, but it's generally Google's way of getting the Android user interface rid of stutter and lags. Essentially, Jelly Bean runs at 60 frames per second where the hardware allows it. Since software engineers didn't stop there, they also added triple buffering (CPU, GPU and display working in parallel, not waiting in turns).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean offers a polished and smooth user interface and coupled with the top of the line chipset in the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition things are lightning fast all the time. The OS is getting closer to offering a lot of the features that skins like Sense 4+, Nature UX and Optimus UI have been having for a while now, and it's interesting to see Google's spin on them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the Android 4.2.2 tweaks don't end here. Follow us as we continue to explore. Next up, Google Now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now slightly updated<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now was first introduced back in Jelly Bean 4.1 and is definitely one of the most interesting additions in the OS. Simply put, it's Google's version of a personal assistant. Google Now is in the same neck of the woods as Apple's Siri, but it learns constantly from your daily routines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's accessed by holding the home button and gives you short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now in the form of cards. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, so it offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Jelly Bean 4.2.2, Google Now has become even smarter and, if you allow it, can scan your email for upcoming flights, deliveries or restaurant reservations and let you know when they are due. There are also numerous kinds of cards like birthdays (yours and those of your contacts) and what distance you've walked in a particular month. The last one could definitely feel creepy for some users, but it's easily turned off from the Google Now settings menu. The latest addition to Google Now cards are TV and Offers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hardware-wise the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition has the same chipset on tap, down to the clock speed. The CPU in question is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 600 and it packs four Krait 300 cores that are clocked as high as 1.9 GHz each, making them 200 MHz faster than what's available in the competitor HTC One Google Play Edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are 2 gigs of RAM on the Google Play Edition S4 and the Adreno 320 handles graphics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already tested the potent Snapdragon 600 in the global Galaxy S4 and we know it can compete on the highest of levels. The interesting question here is whether Google's stock Android will make the device faster or slower. So without further ado, here come the scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition manages to affirm itself in both single and multi-threaded benchmarks BenchmarkPi and Linpack and stands comfortably in front of the TouchWiz-based Galaxy S4 Snapdragon and Exynos variants.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 is a cross-platform benchmark, which allows us to compare the Galaxy Samsung Galaxy S4 against the iPhone 5 and the difference is double. The Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition failed to surpass the Snapdragon-powered S4 by very little but was significantly behind the Octa-core Exynos one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to compound benchmarks, AnTuTu and Quadrant. In AnTuTu the Google Play Edition S4 moved ahead of the S600 one and just below the Octa Galaxy. Quadrant showed it slower than both TouchWiz Galaxies and LG's Optimus G Pro, which also has a Snapdragon 600 on demand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's look at the GPU benchmarks. We ran GLBenchmark 2.5 in 1080p off-screen mode, which is also the native screen resolution for the flagships. The Galaxy Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition trailed behind the Octa, S600 Galaxies and the HTC One.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At GLBenchmark's 2.7 T-Rex 1080p off-screen test the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition was bested by the S4 Active, the iPad 4 and both the Exynos and Snapdragon-powered Galaxies, the latter of which claimed the victory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mali GPU inside the Exynos-powered Galaxy S4 was victorious in the Epic Citadel benchmark and the Google Play Edition S4 managed to secure fourth place.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we come to JavaScript, which is a known Achilles heel to stock Android. As expected, just like the Nexus 4 before it, the Google Play Edition Galaxy S4 was abysmal at SunSpider and fell way behind, third to last in fact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vellamo is another HTML 5-based benchmark, which didn't hand out the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition any compliments either.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So when it comes to general performance the benchmarks show the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition largely on par with its TouchWiz counterparts, if not faster at times. But there are two chinks in its armor and those are the lesser GPU performance and the less than impressive JavaScript scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 320 inside the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition is a very competitive GPU and the device won't choke on any of the games currently available on mobiles. And as for page loading times we weren't disappointed by the device's actual real world performance so we wouldn't worry just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stock Android UI ran perfectly smooth on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition and every animation or app loading was blazing fast - this feels like the fastest device on the market today.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook is unchanged, still great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is the stock Android app People, which hasn't been changed since its major redesign last year with the introduction of Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's made up of three tabs that you can switch between with sideways swipes. The middle tab is the default one, listing all of your contacts. Contacts are listed with a name and a picture to the right. They can be sorted by first or last name, and viewed as first name or last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's regular search as you type too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick contacts feature triggers on tapping a contact image to bring up a tabbed popup window. The tabs are phone and email with a list of the available numbers or addresses. These tabs can be navigated with sideways swipes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single contact view displays the contact's name along with a star to favorite a contact and a Settings button that lets you edit, share or delete a contact, as well assign custom ringtones to them or set the phone to redirect calls from that contact straight to voice mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under that is a list of all contact info sorted by category - phone numbers, emails, events, notes and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts that the phonebook displays can be filtered by service (e.g. hide all Facebook contacts) and even group (so you can hide all contacts that don't belong in a group, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two major tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is readily thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In-call quality with the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition has remained unblemished. Voices come out loud and clear and the device held on to signal without issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is one of the areas where stock Android is a step down from the TouchWiz-ed version of the international S4 model. There's no Direct Call, you can't silence calls by turning the device over and there's no Air View. The Galaxy S4 even has an equalizer feature for calls and more advanced blocking options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features the neon-blue on black theme, but hasn't grown any new functionality. There's still no smart dialing, which is a real shame and frankly getting annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer is just the first tab of the phone app, the other two being the Call log and the Favorites tab (you get the same in the Phonebook). In the Call log, you can't delete individual entries, which is mind-boggling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Edition. It scored a Good overall mark just as the Galaxy S4 I9505. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stellar messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual but with some improvements. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. A cool new feature is that you can select multiple threads to mass delete them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is organized like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts work here too and there's a call shortcut at the top of the screen when viewing a thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition to delete older messages (by default, it keeps 500 texts and 50 MMS). You can activate delivery reports and read reports too (they are notifications that the receiver has read the message).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a text is still frustrating as the text box starts off as a single line and grows only up to three lines, which makes working with longer texts hard. We mostly let it slide on previous versions, but with a 5" screen there's no excuse not to make the text box bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app now features color coded sender images, based on the first letter of the sender's name. This lets you easily see who your most popular email correspondences are with. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool new feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard has now even more room to stretch its legs on the 5" screen and typing is very easy. Keys get even bigger when you switch to landscape mode - the long screen becomes very comfortable for two-thumb typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Jelly Bean 4.2.2 Google introduced a new typing method called Gesture typing. It works in a manner very similar to Swype -- you just Swipe your finger over the letters you want to type, lifting after each word is complete. Naturally, the Gesture Typing feature benefits from the already existing Android word prediction, so you can just click on the words the keyboard suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a "handle" attached to the text cursor - it's easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A double tap will bring up the select options - select word and select all - with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a word has a typo, it will be underlined in red and when you tap it, the phone will offer a number of suggested corrections along with options to add the word to the phone's dictionary or just delete the word.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Your images in SuperAMOLED-y goodness<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery in Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean retains its ICS looks and functionality. The Default view of the gallery is Albums, the first of which is always the Camera album, which has a camera overlay icon too. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is the Make available offline feature - it lets you easily select multiple online albums and download them for offline viewing. The Gallery app supports online albums like Picasa (but not Facebook) and you can set it to sync photos only over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the single photo view is updated too - above the photo are several sharing shortcuts and a delete button, while the underlying line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album isn't present any more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more option. The editor can be accessed from a small icon from the bottom left hand-side corner and offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the strength of the effect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player doesn't compete well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is still not getting the necessary attention from Google and there's still no dedicated videos app (you have to go through the Gallery). Despite the excellent track record of supported video codecs the Galaxy S4 has, the Google Play Edition could only muster mp4 videos, while avi, mov, DivX and XviD were out of the question. We'd suggest using a player with a codec pack, like MXPlayer and enjoy videos on the great 5" Super AMOLED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When compatible, videos played up to FullHD resolution without hiccups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At long last, Google has implemented wirelessly sharing videos with a Wi-Fi enabled TV. The feature relies on the good ol' DLNA technology to connect and the Miracast protocol for streaming. It's another feature most customs launchers had, but is only now making its way to the platform itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Music streams and stores your music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google's own music player called Play Music is on board the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition. It went through a major UI overhaul and is now snappier and more beautiful. It features the spanking New Listen Now feature which tries to determine what you like and the sequence of your track-changing so that it can start offering you music you might like to play next.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Play Music also gives you the option to upload music onto the Google-branded cloud and stream it on your device via Wi-Fi or mobile data. There's also the nifty option of downloading the content onto the device if you want to have there for connection-less times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets that along with a user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen uses the song album art and gives you a quick shortcut to the rest of the artist's songs along with the play controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is working, the lockscreen features the album art and track info for the current song along with simple playback controls. The notification area also lets you control the playback via an expandable notification.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is perfectly clean<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 passed our dedicated audio quality test with flying colors. The smartphone had perfectly clear output when attached to an active external amplifier, with no weak points to its performance. The only thing to frown at here is the only average volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Impressively, there's virtually no distortion when you plug in a pair of headphones. Even the stereo crosstalk which suffers in that case just about every time was barely affected. Unfortunately, the volume levels remained only average.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camera still great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition premieres with the spanking new stock camera app. Although mostly looking unchanged it brings an end to the quick settings ring and instead opts for a quick settings arch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You need to hold a finger anywhere in the viewfinder to get to the quick settings. Using swipe gestures you can toggle HDR, exposure, settings for picture size, white balance, timer, Geo-tagging, scene mode, flash on or off and switching to the front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick settings can also be triggered by touching the corresponding icon atop the virtual shutter button. You can choose Camcorder, Panorama and Photosphere through the underlying shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewfinder is annoyingly though-out. It shows you a 16:9 feed while snapping photos in 4:3 aspect. So in essence it's a real task to frame your photos right and you cannot choose to be shown the native aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photosphere let's you take Street View panoramas of your surroundings. You start by aligning your image and then just move the phone about following a generated dot. After you've covered the entire surrounding scene the device generates a panorama, which can be viewed as a Photosphere in the Gallery and uploaded to Google's servers to be featured in Maps (if it's good enough).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of what you're giving up going for the Galaxy S4 sans the TouchWiz camera optimizations is a lot. The majority of shooting modes are gone - Night and Sports, Panorama isn't as good as the TouchWiz counterpart, there's no Best Photo or Best Face, you cannot remove moving objects with Eraser, there's no Beauty Shot, you cannot create cinemagrams (or GIFs) with Cine Photo, there's no Sound &amp; shot for capturing photos with ambient sound. The list goes on and on. It takes a lot of time to get the hangs of Samsung's image suite but there's no denying it's useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well the purified Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition has none of those and what you're left with is a pretty straight-forward camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the image quality it's safe to say that Google made good work with Samsung to bring an undefiled camera performance to the stock Galaxy S4. The impressive level of detail is all there without more noise creeping back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors look great if a little overly-saturated but it does add extra character to the images. White balance is slightly colder but when viewed on the Super AMOLED you'd be hard-pressed to notice it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's impressive here is that the level of detail hasn't suffered even after the bump in resolution. We're convinced Samsung managed to cross over its processing algorithms from the regular Galaxy S4 over to the Google Play Edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro images turn out great. Focusing happens instantaneously and you don't need to find the macro focusing mode from settings - the camera focuses automatically depending on the distance to the object.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR images come out great too. They're nearly unmistakable when viewed side by side with those from a TouchWiz Galaxy S4. Highlights aren't over-sharpened and the scene is nicely exposed throughout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We could easily say that this is the best camera on a stock Android device and it runs circles around the Nexus 4. Compared to a Galaxy S4 with TouchWiz on board it's identical in terms of quality but lacks half the functionality, which isn't ideal for camera enthusiasts.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great FullHD video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface borrows heavily from the camera one. It is, however, very limited in terms of options and gives you settings for white balance, camera preference (front or back), a flash toggle, Geo-tagging and the option to choose the video resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can take full-resolution images while recoding a video, which is great, especially given the fact that the camera does continuous autofocus during video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an option for taking time lapse videos. You can choose an interval between 0.5 and 24 seconds, minutes or hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition stores videos in mp4 format with a bitrate of around 17 Mbps and 29 frames per second. Audio bitrate is 123 Kbps with 48 kHz sampling rate and 2 channels (using both mikes for stereo). Those stats are exactly the same as the regular Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So in theory it should post the same videos and it does. While not an improvement over the Galaxy S III or the Galaxy S4 videos turn out really good. There are loads of detail, continuous autofocus manages to refocus every time there's a change in scenery and you can snap full resolution 16:9 stills while you're capturing a video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes a sample.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition starts off with the basics - quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and quad-band 3G. An LTE-variant of the device will also be available for supported regions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's latest Android flagship uses Bluetooth 4.0 alongside Wi-Fi support which includes a/b/g/n/ac, as well as the new ac standard, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition allows you to share all sorts of media via NFC by simply touching the device and other NFC-capable devices back-to-back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an IR-port, which allows you to control various TV's and other devices using Samsung's WatchON app, which we'll cover below. Luckily this functionality is still available in the Google Play Edition Samsung flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, for wired connectivity we have the MHL 2.0 port. By all appearances it is a normal microUSB port and works as one (a charger port as well). But the MHL 2.0 port enables video output by using a MHL-to-HDMI dongle. There isn't one included in the retail box and those can be hard to come by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you plug the dongle into the phone you also need to plug a charger into the additional microUSB port on the dongle and the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition screen will be mirrored on the TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MHL 2.0 port has yet another feature - it features USB On-The-Go. You'll need an adapter for that too (there isn't one in the box) but this one is fairly straightforward - you plug it into the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition and plug a standard USB cable on the other end.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is in charge of web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition comes with Google Chrome as a default web browser out of the box, replacing the generic Android browser, which isn't even present. The interface hasn't changed since Chrome's launch for Android and is clean and minimalist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop buttons next to tabs and settings buttons. You can switch between tabs with a wide swipe from either the left or right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with its desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous on settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi access, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's options, you'll also have the option to turn the auto-fill of forms and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, while Chrome excels in many areas, it falls short on the one that could be a deal-breaker for many of Android users and this is Flash. Sadly, viewing Flash content is the one thing you won't be able to do here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Basic organizing will do<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition doesn't come with a dedicated file browser or a document editor. However, after installing a third-party file browser we were able to open all the different document types: DOC, XLS, PPT from Office 2003 and 2007 along with PDF using Google Drive with ease..</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar's look hasn't changed drastically and its functionality is as good as ever. There are four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events. Recently Google added color-coding to events, which helps with organizing tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has redone its Clock app, giving it a major overhaul. Opening it brings you to your local time giving you the ability to add as many additional world capital cities as you'd like (they will also be visible on your lockscreen widget upon expanding).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual alarm functionality is still present, albeit the fresh new design. You can set multiple alarms, each with its own repeat pattern, ringtone and label. The app also comes with a stopwatch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big, easily thumbable keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Stock Android isn't big on organizing but you can find pretty much anything in the Google Play store. Note apps like Google Keep or Evernote, different calendars, different office viewers, calculators, anything.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Google Earth will guide you through<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start (it supports GLONASS for faster, more accurate locks too). You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache Berlin and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play store has all the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean, the Google Edition Galaxy S4 has access to the latest available apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>What Google presented at its I/O 2013 conference was something few of us really expected to happen. Announcing a Galaxy S4 with stock Android is still a little baffling and goes against many of the principles of the Nexus lineup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S4 has expandable storage, it has physical buttons, it's a mass product lacking the air of exclusivity a Nexus usually manages to pull off. And it comes for a premium from the Google Play store. Sure it's the most capable device that comes with stock Android and runs circles around any Nexus you can think of and probably will still be a worthy contender, come the Nexus 5, or whatever the next Google Purebread is called.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The caveat however is that you can possibly still get the same vanilla Android experience by getting yourself a subsidized Snapdragon-powered Galaxy S4 and installing a stock ROM on it with a little tweaking. This way you would essentially have the best of both worlds - an unlocked door to a stable stock experience without closing the door to the Samsung-tailored TouchWiz experience behind you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So does the Google Play Edition S4 make sense? Well not really. It's availability is limited to the US and there it costs more than the equivalent hardware from every major carrier and it takes away much of the software perks of one of the best, if not the best, smartphone on the market today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That said, here are some of the alternatives. First and foremost, You could always buy the Snapdragon 600 Galaxy S4 (I9505) and just flash the stock Android ROM on it, leaving you with pretty much the same device but one you bought for less money and one that can always revert back to the tightly-optimized Samsung software on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you could go for the Exynos-packing Galaxy S4. It doesn't have the stock Android option, but offers a tad more potent processor with four Cortex-A15 cores and four Cortex-A7 ones making it even more of a powerhouse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung I9505 Galaxy S4 ? Samsung I9500 Galaxy S4</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If stock Android is what you are after then you could always opt for the LG-made Google Nexus 4. It's the real deal when it comes to software and will likely always get the fresh new OS before the Galaxy S4 Google Play Edition. What you're made to live with is a lesser display, no expandable storage, inferior camera, poorer battery life and no LTE. Still the $350 price tag for the 16 gig model certainly makes this the better value-for-money option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Nexus 4 E960</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC One goes about its business with 32 gigs of storage and no expandable option, a smaller screen on roughly the same body size, a 4 MP camera that shines only in low-light and the same chipset only clocked slightly lower. Still, it's undeniably much cooler looking than the Galaxy S4 and offers a premium build quality with its sleek aluminum unibody.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also outdoes the Galaxy S4s in audio performance and sports the spanking Beats-powered front speakers we enjoyed so much. Last but not least it comes in two versions - the One you could buy for less from the Google Play store with the same stock Android experience and the One with HTC's smooth Sense 5 experience on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC One</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the Sony Xperia Z. It comes with water-resistance out of the box, has a 13 MP snapper, a good Snapdragon S4 chipset and a 5" 1080p Mobile BRAVIA engine 2 display. It's been around for a while and costs much less than a Galaxy S4 (Google Play edition or otherwise). Also the Xperia Z launcher is quite close to stock Android, so the user experience is similar, even if software updates won't be as quick.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So there you have it. Too many contenders willing to do pretty much the same for less. If stock Android software's what you're after, then you needn't buy the expensive Google Pay Edition Galaxy S4 - you might as well go for the subsidized TouchWiz-ed one, it just makes more sense. It gives you more in terms of software and the same in terms of hardware without the need to compromise.</paragraph>
