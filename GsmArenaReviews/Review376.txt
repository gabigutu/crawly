			<paragraph>The controversial Samsung X830 won?t leave you indifferent. It is a MP3 player with 1 GB of built-in memory on one hand, and a mobile phone, supporting Bluetooth and EDGE on the other hand. The unusual design also draws the attention ? it will amuse some, while it will definitely inspire others.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The topic of the this year?s Christmas time when it comes to mobile communications was clearly the music player capabilities of mobile phones. After the music-oriented models such as 5200 and 5300, the specially designed smart phones such as 3250 Xpress Music and 5500 Sport Music Edition of the Finnish brand Nokia and after the top Sony Ericsson W850i and W950i Walkmans, here comes the Korean Samsung. The untraditional X830 model again predisposes to thoughts, whether the music players? integration into the world of mobile phones won?t take to an exactly opposite direction.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>We have already met<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The X830 concept comes from the SPH-S4300 model, being available from the first quarter of 2006 in Korea; we have already seen this model on the CeBIT Fair in Hanover. Physically, Samsung appears more like a music player than like a mobile. The multimedia functions in a phone are essential for a certain group of people. On principle, however, we expect that the phone functions won?t suffer from the multimedia ones. Unfortunately, the manufacturers often do this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  Official pictures ? Samsung X830 offers a variety of colors</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The overall phone design is contradictory in many ways. To some it may look stylish, to others ? the new form may look rather controversial. True fact is that the dimensions of 84 x 30 x 19 mm are at least unusual and hardly remind of an ordinary phone. I thought that the Samsung weighs less at first sight. The weight of 72 g however was no such a big surprise, having in mind the phone size. Yet, from current models it compares only to Sony Ericsson J100 in terms of weight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  The phone in pink ? held in hand ? size comparison with N73 ? and with a credit card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to the available information Samsung X830 will be sold in six color variants: blue, green, orange, pink, white and black. I would unambiguously prefer the more conservative black variant. I didn?t like much the orange-silver cover of the sample model we had for testing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Ah, those swivel hinges<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There aren?t many models with rotating construction on the market. Unfortunately the Samsung X830 swivel mechanism is not very successful. The disadvantages aren?t visible at common manipulation, but the construction won?t stand at thorough testing. The deflections in closed, semi open and fully open positions may be felt clearly and you have to get used to them in the phone?s everyday use. Moreover, while in closed position the lock mechanism does its job satisfactory, but when opened, it fails to lock the upper part in an upright position. A little consolation is the fact, that rotating it about ten degrees activates the opening mechanism, which provides the movement to the upper position side. So, you don?t have to push it all the way up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The phone open ? swivel mechanism details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the phone with one hand is easy due to its width of only 30 mm. It?s enough to turn the phone with display down and push with thumb to the right side board. It?s easy for right-handers; left-handed people have to make bigger effort. Right thumb manipulation is after all simpler than pushing with the other left hand fingers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The outsides<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung body is made of plastic covers, supplemented by metal buttons. One such button serves for locking the music player controls; the lower edge of the same side features the traditional eyelet for a neck strip. The opposite side incorporates two buttons, intended for volume control. The cover of the common connector for headphones, data cable and charger is situated above them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp;  All side views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To loosen the battery cover, use the buttons, located on the upper. They seem more as dummy buttons, because pressing them is practically impossible and removing the battery will cost you some more efforts and strain. The battery cover takes ? of the mobile?s back side; the built-in camera lens is located on the remaining area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Details of the side elements </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The provided battery is Li-Ion with capacity of 800 mAh and maximum indicated lifetime of 120 h in stand-by and 3 h of talk time. The real values move about two and a half days in stand-by mode. Using the music functions shortens the battery charging cycle, of course, but still it easily lasts one day without need to be charged.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two columns are not enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Another potential contradiction has in itself the name for ?keypad?. Let?s begin with the dominating control assembly, which is a rotating round key with confirming center area, located on the front side under the display. In case the constant turning of the finger all round doesn?t satisfy you, the oval acts also as a classic four-ways key. It?s enough to press the rotating area in the chosen direction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rotating control ? details of the functional keys ? numeric buttons ? lightning in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing and rotating have one and the same effect in the menu and most of the sub-menus. The music player, however, fully utilizes the potential of the dual function of this navigation key. When you have the music player turned on pressing and rotating have different functions assigned to them. When the phone is in stand-by mode the rotating navigation button can be assigned to trigger one of 17 predefined specific functions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rotating the cover reveals an area with seventeen keys. Five of them are functional; the other ones are part of the alphanumeric keypad. It will take you more time to get used to those alphanumeric keys, located unusually in two columns, than to the rotating button. In addition, the buttons are little tougher than normal, so the messaging fans will have to sweat the first few days. The gentle key feedback though gives you confidence during typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The operations you do by pressing the functional keys, situated in the upper part of the keypad are showed on the display. It is a little confusing, so don?t worry when in the beginning you press the round item instead of a functional button. The backlighting is excellent. The signs on all the keys are perfectly legible in the dark. It?s a pity that the confirming centre area doesn?t light up. It would be easier to find it in the dark and the illuminating effect would surely contribute to the phone attractiveness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A strip, which shines<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The display of the Samsung X830 is an active TFT one with resolution of 128 x 220 pixels and it is capable of displaying up to 262K colors. The display shows a detailed image, although the resolution is relatively low. The font used in the phone system however, is unnecessarily rough and only spoils the overall impression.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shiny coating on the surface is not a good prerequisite for use in the sunlight, so in such conditions be prepared for lower legibility. The display lightening has two levels of intensity; the timeout before the phone enters its power saving low-light regime can be adjusted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Display in daylight... ? ...and in the night</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s impossible to select smaller font size, that?s why most of the menu items end with three dots and their full names are available only through scrolling. For text messages there are two preset text sizes you may choose from; it takes nine text lines to fill up the screen when using the smallest font.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Through shortcuts ? wherever you like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The X830 user interface is the typical one for Samsung lately. The manufacturer used it for example in the latest highly successful model D900. A limiting disadvantage is the display size, which is hardly comparable to that of the D900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Standby display ? two possible previews of the main menu ? display in landscape mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display in standby mode shows time, date, operator logo, signal strength, battery status and other active services by means of system icons. Some preinstalled wallpapers are available, you may add others too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clicking the left context key takes you to the main menu. A press of the rotating key confirming central area activates the WAP browser. The menu offers two different views such as icons grid (2 x 4 icons) or list view. The number of items is constant and can?t be modified. The key shortcuts serve for fast access to the submenus. There is a number in front of every item of the menu, designating the short key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: the tested sample had a lot of software faults. For example ? the wrong translated items or some simply wrong located items in the settings. Let?s hope that the retail version won?t have such disadvantages.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Take a snapshot<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nowadays even the MP3 player can take photos. The Samsung X830 particularly is equipped with a 1.3 megapixel camera and a maximum picture size of 1280 x 1024 pixels. The camera functions are very limited with the hardware options as in the case of the display. The camera release button is located so inappropriately, that you can easily drop the mobile from your hands while shooting. Moreover, the picture taken can?t fit into the display in its full size, so in case you want to have a view of what you have shot, you have to limit the size of the viewfinder image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; Camera lenses ? self-portrait mirror</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung endeavors to compensate the hardware disadvantages by the used software. Except the common pictures and video records in maximum resolution of 352 x 288 pixels (in this case the video length is limited only by the free memory available) it offers also basic options and a few effects - inserting frames in the picture, timer, quality setting, scenic program, night mode, white balance or ISO. White balance and color effects are available for video records too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tip: view the short video record, taken by Samsung X830&nbsp;(ZIP archive; 1,4 MB)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Camera background ? menu ? list of pictures ? picture details</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality however, is not merely comparable to the best cameraphones. On one hand the resolution is not enough, on the other ? as you may see - the pictures quality is very poor. Further, you can?t modify the pictures in the phone, you can only view them, classify them into folders, eventually send them via Bluetooth or MMS. Sending via MMS is the most suitable way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Offline, but with a SIM card<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung X830 is a tri-band phone, it works in all GSM networks, supporting 900/1800/1900 MHz. A huge drawback of the Korean mobiles is the lack of ringing profiles. They are replaced by a simple selection between normal and silent mode. While in silent mode the phone vibrates or does nothing, in normal setting it is capable of 64-voice melody or MP3 tones, vibrates or vibrates and then rings. It doesn?t support vibration and ringing simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A special ?profile? in the menu is the Offline mode, when all network functions in the phone are deactivated. However, the Offline mode startup requires SIM card, inserted in the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a large phonebook with a capacity of 1000 entries. Add the SIM card capacity to this, because Samsung shows all numbers together. The details you can save for a given contact in the internal phonebook include first name, last name, mobile phone number, office and home phone number, fax, e-mail and note. You can associate a ringtone and a picture to every group of contacts. The contact entries are ordered in a list by the first name and you may search them by entering the initial letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Selecting memory for storing ? contact editing ? contact detail ? phonebook </paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have to take with you the provided handsfree set in the car ? the loudspeakers aren?t loud enough. The volume in the headphones themselves is loud enough, so you won?t have problems even in noisy streets. The phone can record calls in cooperation with the Recorder application. In this case you are limited by the size of the free memory or by one hour time limit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Where is the email?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung X830 has only two basic message types ? SMS and MMS. Do you miss something? Unfortunately, there wasn?t enough space for emails in the phone, which is a big drawback nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text messages editor is completely basic. In the right upper corner it shows whether the T9 dictionary is in use or not, in the left one it shows the characters counter. The editor doesn?t indicate the number of parts, to which the eventual SMS would be divided ? you?ll learn that in the course of sending. The maximum number of characters is 1836.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Message parts ? message types ? SMS editor ? SMS options </paragraph>
			<paragraph>EMS elements may be added to SMS ? text formatting, simple pictures and animations. There are seven text lines for reading by default, so to read a whole text messages you must scroll trough two, sometimes three whole screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart folders<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone memory allows for storing 200 text messages and has 3MB space for multimedia ones. Items are automatically stored in standard folders like Delivered, Drafts, Outbox and Sent. Besides, you may create your own folders. One of the ten preset ringing melodies may signalize of an incoming message, there is also a vibration alert, here the SMS and MMS setting is separate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You?ll find text, sound, picture, video and page browsing between the options for MMS creation. The maximum size of one multimedia message is 300 KB. All new incoming messages are stored in the folder Inbox, regardless of their type - text or multimedia. You may select up to 10 phone numbers from which no messages will be delivered to you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>It plays cool<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Slowly, we have come close to the culmination of today?s review ? the music player. The main Samsung X830 priority is its memory. It disposes of 1 GB internal memory, which is a good achievement for a middle class MP3 player nowadays. Regrettably, there?s no option for expanding it with a memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;To turn on the player you have to close the cover ? list of tracks</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music players is turned on either by a link from the Application menu or by holding the confirmation key, located in the middle of the rotating assembly. No one knows why the cover must be closed when the player is turned on. After that you may operate with the phone as usual and leave the music play in the background. Taking pictures though won?t be possible without the deactivation of the player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing ? player options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player?s background is not standard. There is a picture in the centre of all, resembling a rotating key with marked control options. Rotating the control to the left or right changes the tracks; the up and down keys allows access to the context menu. In the menu itself you move by means of the rotating key, the middle button confirms a selection. The side buttons are assigned for controlling the volume level, holding the silver HOLD button locks the player against unwanted presses of any keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;Volume level control ? settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has support for playlists too. Here the pieces are ordered either automatically or manually into few folders according to their character, usage frequency and so on. The player settings include options for repeating or shuffling the tracks, 3D sound and also selecting from nine preset equalizer settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Your kind of music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The headset, provided in the retails package is divided into two parts. There is a cable, coming from the phone with a fastening clip, microphone and slot for a jack type connector. There is a call operating button on the microphone. In case you are not in a call, the first press of the button opens the list of last dialed numbers, while the second press ? dials the currently selected item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second part is the classic headphones. The quality of the retail headset is really very poor and is only good enough for making calls. A good alternative is to connect your personal headphones; the results may be exceptional, because of the high-quality sound of the music player. We tried a comparison with Samsung YP-U2 MP3 player; I noticed only minor differences, which can be softened with a correct setup of the equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The headphones, provided in the package are not of high quality </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fastest way to store music files into the phone is copying them via data cable. You can use either the PC Studio mode for communication with the software with the same name or the so called MTP mode, Mass Storage is not between the options. MTP mode (Media Transfer Protocol) enables fast transfer of multimedia files to/from Windows applications. Practically it means that for example you may copy music to your phone directly from Windows Media Player. Learn more about MTP protocol at Wikipedia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>I couldn?t manage to open the MTP with Windows Media Player 9. The player was ok, but the copying was running just ?imaginary?. As a result, I couldn?t find any of the selected files. According to Wikipedia MTP needs at least Windows Media Player 10. Yet, I can?t explain to myself why the lower player version didn?t notify of any mistake and behaved as if nothing was wrong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Useful calendar, no Java<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The tools for time organization are in the Application menu. The Calendar is right under the music player. It?s very useful even at small display, it offers well-arranged summary of tasks and reminders available to you at a glance. The primary monthly view may be changed to weekly or daily view. There are three types of records ? Plan, Anniversary, Tasks ? the calendar capacity is up to 100 records for each of them. A very useful tool is the displaying of missed events, offering overview of what you have missed and what you have to carry out in the future.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> &nbsp; Application menu ? calendar ? world time ? alarm clock</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have already mentioned the Recorder application. It works during the calls too. There are two games under the item Java World. It will take you time to get used to play those games due to the unusual layout of the keypad. Although the menu item is called Java World, the phone does not support additional Java games or applications! Ordinarily Samsung offers three alarm clocks with option to set the wake-up duration and an option to select personal ringtone for pleasant morning waking up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;  Recorder ? calculator ? unit converter ? stopwatch</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organization features are really generously presented in the phone. Except the already mentioned functions, there are also ? World time, Calculator, Unit Converter, Timer, Stopwatch, Check word and Note. Notwithstanding its simple view, the calculator can distinguish prioritized arithmetical operations and works with brackets. The maximum length of one equation is 100 signs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart synchronization<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Data transfers are presented mainly by GPRS and EDGE class 10. For close-range communication with another device you may use the wireless Bluetooth, or of course ? the provided USB data cable. The WAP browser is also very basic; there aren?t any complex settings in it. It contains history of visited pages, list of favorite links and options for sending them. A big drawback is the display resolution, which is an essential factor in web displaying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The desktop application Samsung PC Studio is an excellent complement for more comfortable phone management. It allows you to modify the phonebook contacts from the PC, to send easily text messages, to copy files from and to the phone, to set up connection to Internet, to compose multimedia message, to playback multimedia files or to synchronize the phone with the phonebook and contacts in your Outlook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   &nbsp;Downloading data from the phone? phonebook management ? organizer ? a list of data profiles</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synchronization with Outlook is simple without unnecessary and overcomplicated settings, and except for the Tasks, which do not get transferred very accurately, it works great. A similar application for phone management trough PC can be found only in the Windows based smartphones and in Nokia mobiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Synchronization and setup options (the program did not manage the bigger font size setup in Windows really well) </paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The price is of great importance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The contradiction remains alive to the very end. The phone has its pros and cons. Samsung X830 is definitely not the best of a mobile phone. In its case we can rather talk about style for young people and all, who love quality music, who do not mind some extravagance and don?t mind spending some money on it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Consider well exactly what you want before purchase ? just a phone, a MP3 player or a combination of both. The first two variants are easy to get separately and cheaper; if you want a reliable combination of them both, here is the Samsung X830.</paragraph>
