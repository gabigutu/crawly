			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We were almost starting to suspect mobile phones of giving up and playing soft. They seemed unstoppable you know. They went from 5 to 12 in no time and there was nothing to suggest that digicams will ever get a timeout for a much needed breather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprised or not, the game is back on and Nokia are pulling the big guns out. The N8 is the new wannabe king of cameraphones. Fat numbers on the specs sheet and all that shining armor, the new Nseries flagship is hitting hard and playing tough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 has two massive tasks on its hands: beat digicams at their own game and bring Symbian back to its past glory. The hardest thing perhaps is to tell which one is harder. But if anyone should be trusted to perform a seemingly impossible stunt, (still) market leaders Nokia are a safer bet than many.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N8 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you see the hardware is all there ? there?re not too many devices out there that can match the Nokia N8. Some will understandably frown at what looks like unimpressive CPU clock speed and scarce RAM. Just remember that it?s the performance to be judged here and not the sheer numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Different platforms have different needs so we?ll only know if Symbian^3 can do without a 1GHz Snapdragon after we?ve seen the N8 in proper action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A full physical is due starting right after the break.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia N8 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 stands at 113.5 x 59.1 x 12.9 mm, adding up to a volume of 86 cc. The numbers aside, the handset does feel thick and stocky. Not to an extent to risk being considered second rate but somewhat short of the finesse of most other recent touchscreen flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a way, the phone is bigger than its 3.5? touchscreen suggests. On the other hand, they simply needed room for the large image sensor, wide-angle lens and Xenon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone still fits nicely in hand and the hefty 135 g give a solid feel that we do appreciate. If you like your handset slim and lightweight, feel free to disagree with us on this one.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 is certainly among the best looking mobile phones in existence. Its sleek aluminum unibody is a joy to behold.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are only a couple of things that seem to separate the N8 design from perfection. The camera lens and flash seem to be protruding a bit too much on the back, and the top and bottom parts are made of plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However as we already mentioned, the N8 must be a smartphone and a digicam simultaneously so compromises had to be made. And subjectively as it may be, Nokia seem to have found the right balance here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of the Nokia N8 is mostly taken by the 3.5? AMOLED display of nHD resolution, which brings several firsts to the Nokia mobile phones portfolio. Capacitive touchscreen debuted on the X6 but only now is Nokia introducing multi-touch support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another first is that the N8 also packs the first AMOLED display by the Finnish manufacturer to remain perfectly legible under direct sunlight. Previous attempts were pretty poor on a bright sunny day, but this time they got it right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The indoor image quality, as is to be expected from an AMOLED unit, is pretty good with deep blacks and nicely saturated colors. However it is hardly a match for the SuperAMOLED screens on the Samsung Galaxy S lineup and the Samsung S8500 Wave. We are yet to see how those compare to the ClearBlack units on the more recently announced batch of touch-driven Nokia handsets, but they certainly are a class above the N8. Too bad Samsung?s going to suffer SuperAMOLED shortages for at least six months more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolution of the Nokia N8 is hardly impressive, though we wouldn?t go as far as calling it inadequate. At 360 x 640 pixels, the Nokia N8 has 44 percent less pixels than the best Android displays (854 x 480 pixels) and just over a third of the iPhone 4 pixel count (960 x 640 pixels).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not everyone needs that kind of pixel density though, and some of the users probably won?t even be able to find the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The N8 screen sensitivity is as good as we?ve come to expect from a capacitive unit. Vibration feedback does deserve a mention however as it seems unusually well tuned and further improves the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on, we notice the video-call camera above the display, in the upper right corner of the front panel. Near it are the ambient light and the proximity sensors, as well as the earpiece, which is located in the dead center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the microphone pinhole and the menu key. There are no hardware call-handling keys as on previous Nokia smartphones and we found that a bit confusing at first, but eventually got used to it. Yet what we believe would have improved usability is a hardware back button as the software one is by far not as comfortable, being in a different place at different parts of the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the Nokia N8 top panel there?s the power key (which can also be used for locking the device or alternating its profiles), the HDMI port and the 3.5mm audio jack. The HDMI port is hidden under a small plastic lid to keep out dust and grime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An important thing to note here is that the Nokia N8 can provide 720p TV-out through the HDMI port and with DivX and XviD support on-board it might just be enough to replace your home media player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side packs a couple of slots (this is where the microSD and SIM cards go) and the unprotected microUSB port. Charging through microUSB works fine so you don?t have to bring a charger with you all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the Nokia N8 features nothing but the Nokia proprietary charger plug. The charger plug lets you use your old charger with the N8 too, giving you a better chance of finding somewhere to plug your device when you are away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side of the N8 there are the volume rocker, the screen lock slider and the dedicated camera key. The first two are comfortable enough, providing great grip (mostly the ribbed lock slider) and tactile feedback, so they render no usability obstacles. The camera key on the other hand is probably a bit too stiff and requires a bit of extra effort for a full press. This might result in camera shake in some of your shots, which is not exactly ideal, considering which handset we are talking about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 12 megapixel camera lens is what grabs your attention when you turn to the phone?s back. It doesn?t have a protective cover as that would have added quite a few millimeters to the device waistline. Instead it relies on reinforced glass that Nokia promises is sturdy enough to resist all the abuse you are going to subject the device to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other elements of interest here are the xenon flash and the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the hood, the Nokia N8 packs the 1200 mAh LI-Ion BL-4D battery that should last for up to 400 hours of stand-by or up to 12 hours and 30 minutes of talk time. Those are some pretty impressive numbers for a medium-sized battery like this, but we?ll have to wait for the full review to be completed to see if the real-life performance is so good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are generally very impressed with the Nokia N8 build quality. The handset seems fit to last in the long run.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the full-blown review already in the works, we are not going to focus much on the user interface for now. We will just give you a brief overview of the new stuff that Symbian^3 introduces to give an idea of what to expect and proceed to the show the highlight - the camera section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So just as Anssi Vanjoki said at Nokia World this year, at first glance you won't see many changes when you first get a Symbian^3 device in your hand. Yet when you start to actually use the device, you realize that the Finnish engineers haven't been wasting their time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Symbian^1 (or S60 5th edition, if you will) Nokia left itself an escape path in case the whole touch-driven thing didn't work out and the world suddenly decided to return to regular keys. It's things like tap-to-select, second tap to activate and reverse scrolling we are talking about, which would allow the OS to be used with a D-pad if the company were to release such a device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the touch phone demand showed no signs of slowing down, this turned out to be a huge mistake, as it proved rather detrimental to the user experience. Firmware updates to S^1 devices patched things here and there but we all knew Nokia was just buying time here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fortunately, Nokia is now done with the safety approach and are going all-in with the touch game. Symbian^3 scrolls the right way and activates any icon or list item with a single click (barring the camera interface where two clicks are still required at times). Scrolling animations are also smoother and offer some effects like the icons bumping against the end of the screen and coming back when you reach the end of the list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short video demo of the user interface in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new OS also brings some nice UI layout and functionality changes. The homescreen is the most evident of those, its size now expanded to three panes worth of space. You are then free to fill them up with widgets and then rearrange them as you see fit. If three panels are too much for you and you hate the extra scrolling you can also delete some of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu structure is unchanged, retaining the folders format. This comes in contrast to Android, and mostly iOS, where you get a flat menu structure with all icons located on side-scrollable panes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting on top of the food chain is a slow process, requiring lots of effort and time but Symbian^3 definitely looks like a step in the right direction. We'll be able to tell how big a step it is exactly only when the full review is completed but fortunately this shouldn't take too long now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>12 MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's be honest - it's the reason why you are here. The Nokia N8 hopes to change the way we perceive cameraphones, by making the shooter its leading feature. Nokia did their homework and packed the device with the largest sensor a mobile phone has seen (stretching to 1/1.83" inches). It has an advantage of roughly 50% over regular 1/2.5" sensors found in the Samsung Pixon12 and the Sony HX5, that we recently featured in a blind camera shootout. The larger sensor surface should benefit its low-light capabilities and dynamic range greatly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But it doesn't end there - the Nokia N8 also comes with a mechanical shutter, a powerful xenon flash, a 28mm wide-angle lens and a front lens made out of reinforced glass. The built-in ND filter will compensate for the lack of variable aperture in those extremely bright conditions when you just cannot increase the shooting speed any more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Judging by the results of the blind test we conducted yesterday, the company has also managed to deliver on the image quality front as the Nokia N8 managed to convincingly outdo the previous cameraphone ruler, the Samsung Pixon12 and an expensive compact digicam such as the Sony DSC-HX5v Cyber-shot. And here come the promised full resolution samples from the three cameras so you can check them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be honest we are a bit surprised by the results. No, we are not saying that the N8 does something wrong and its win isn't deserved. Right on the opposite - the handset is undoubtedly the best cameraphone in existence.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's just that the company's philosophy with the N8 is to do as little processing as possible, giving the image a natural look, rather than going for more saturated colors and higher contrast. We thought that this approach won't produce images as appealing to the wide audience. As it turns out we were in the wrong and the Nokia imaging team really knew what they were doing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-measured in-camera post-processing has kept the images from the excessive noise that you usually get when you boost color channels to achieve more pumped up color output.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus it allows you to fiddle with the images in post processing leaving quite some room to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia imaging team also had a very sensible approach to noise suppression, wiping away colored chroma noise, but leaving the more bearable luminance noise be, which allowed them to retain as much fine detail as possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Add all those factors together and you will see why the Nokia N8 managed to trash the competition in the high ISO part of yesterday's test. Elsewhere things were more evenly matched with the large sensor advantage not as noticeable in good lighting. Yet, even then, the Finnish flagship cameraphone delivers slightly more resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that came to our attention in the test is the fact that the N8 lens unit has almost no geometrical imperfections unlike the Pixon12 lens, which has notable barrel distortion. There's no fringing too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cell phone world has found its new camera champion in the face of Nokia N8 and the digicams are starting to feel the heat. We didn't need that much time to realize that, but we are still examining the margin of the N8 win. That final question should get its answers once our full review is complete.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 does well on the video end too - it offers 720p recording at 25 fps, which is on par with the best in class. However the Nseries new king also offers very important extra that can easily make it stand out against the competition - its 3x digital zoom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You won't hear us praising digital zooming in any way, but with the Nokia N8 it's different. Most cameraphones zoom in by cropping a part of the live video stream and then upsizing it back to 720p, making up for severely pixilated or blurry result.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its competitors, the Nokia N8 shoots regular 720p video by using all the 12 megapixels worth of its sensor and when it's time for zooming, it uses these 12 megapixels as a source.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a result there's always enough resolution to crop from for a magnifications so the resulting 720p videos are always top-notch for magnifications up to 3 times.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bad news is that we found a strange bug - the Nokia N8 only starts doing that smart zooming when you are at about 2x. Before that it behaves identically to every other handset out there and looses quality. We've prepared a short video to make our point more clear (the effect is best perceived when you watch it fullscreen).</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are really hoping that Nokia will step up and fix this up in a future firmware update. Before that we suggest you set the zoom in your N8 to either the widest position or close to the longest end (2-3x).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Damian Dinning was kind enough to shed some light on the matter. As it turns out a software fix is impossible since the problem lies in the sensor?s inability to output its full 12mp resolution at 25fps. That?s why it uses binning to output a reduced resolution. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you zoom beyond 2x however only a portion of the sensor is used and then 25fps can be achieved. With no binning you get sharper images but somewhat noisier low-light results. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally Damian Dinning shared that he and his team are already working on a new firmware that should provide much smoother zooming during videos. </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the image quality of the N8 videos is concerned, the Finns took identical approach as with the still pictures. The video image processing is reduced as much as possible, giving the clips a more natural look. The problem is post-processing videos in not nearly as easy or accessible to the regular user as it is with photos so maybe they should have gone for more "punchiness" this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also prepared an impromptu video shootout, replacing the Pixon12 (which only manages D1 footage) with the iPhone 4 (which gives the best video resolution on a mobile phone by some distance). The Sony digicam participates as well. It can do 1080p recordings but was set to 720p for this test. Check out those screens we grabbed from the three videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia N8 doesn't impress as much here. It fails to resolve as much detailn as its competitors. Of course things like color balance, noise, contrast and exposure are equally important for video recording so it's not all lost for the N8. We will be examining those in the full review and see if the Nokia N8 will manage to grab the best camcorder title too. It's certain though that it won't be as easy as in the photo round.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For now enjoy a couple of sample videos we captured with the N8 on a day when the weather wasn't particularly good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia's free fall over the past three years certainly took them a long way from the top. They still aren't prepared to battle it out at the highest level so they need to buy some time until they get up to speed. And the Nokia N8 seems a damn good shot at that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It brings enough goodies on the hardware side to make it a best-seller, while introducing significant software updates, which quietly bring Symbian another step forward in the smartphone race. If the handset manages to maintain this kind of performance for the complete out-and-out review, it has every chance of being announced as the best Nokia smartphone since the N95.</paragraph>
