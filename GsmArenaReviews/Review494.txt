			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The holiday season is fast approaching and the gift shopping deadline is one you don't really want to miss. Just the right time to pick then and hopefully this guide will help you spot a good deal among the most deserving smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we're working bottom-up, starting at the sub-?100 bracket and going all the way. Each phone gets a short description and a summary of pros and cons. This time we're throwing in some test results from our reviews to make it even more informative.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that we've based the price on how much a phone costs without any carrier (or other) subsidies and with VAT and shipping added. Off-contract phones are picking up even in the US, the land of the free $200 iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another consideration is availability. There are some excellent devices that target just India or just China, but we couldn't include those, since they mean little to our international readership. You can import phones, but sometimes it's too much of a hassle and there are good alternatives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of alternatives, on each page you'll find a "What didn't make the cut" chapter. There we explain why certain phones are not on the recommendation list. Some of those are region-limited, others are niche products (e.g. a rugged phone), so don't skip them - you may find just the phone for you, if you have more specific needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we start, we'll give a few pointers on the next page - what's the difference between "IPS" and "AMOLED" and other info if you don't know the slang.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the links to take you straight to the price bracket you're interested in. Make sure to check the price below and above, maybe you'll find a cheaper phone that works for you or a slightly pricier device that you like better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Happy hunting!</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A few pointers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Writing about the latest phone each day has steeped us in the lingo and minutiae of smartphones, but not everyone is well-versed in the jargon. This page serves as a quick guide to the most important terms and features behind a modern smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've reviewed many of the phones we recommend (we seek out mostly good and interesting phones) so you can dive into more detail about each handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is the focus of how we interact with our phone, there are barely any hardware controls left. We want the biggest possible screen, without the phone getting huge. You can check the screen-to-body ratio that gives you an idea of how efficiently the phone designers used the available space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that it's more important for the side bezels to be thin - wide phones are difficult to hold and operate single-handedly. Bezels above and below the screen make the phone taller, but that affects pocketability more than comfort of use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most common screens are LCDs, like your TV or your computer monitor. Watch out for the IPS label, these screens are usually higher quality and have wider viewing angles. "Viewing angle" refers to the how much you can tilt the screen before the color and contrast deteriorate beyond legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast is also an important reading - it's the difference between the brightest white and the darkest black. Low-contrast screens make for a dull image, while high-contrast screens make images pop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also affects how legible the screen remains on a bright, sunny day. The reflectivity of the glass also affects legibility as glare can cover up the screen image. Our sunlight rating measures how legible the screen remains in practice: below 2 is poor legibility, 2-3 is average, above 3 is very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AMOLED screens work differently from LCDs. They can fully switch off a pixel, making it perfectly black. This makes for amazing contrast and usually better sunlight legibility. Some find AMOLED colors too saturated, but many companies offer several viewing profiles to adjust the saturation and white balance so you can set it up as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smartphones are slowly killing the point &amp; shoot cameras, but even traditional phone cameras are changing. Many people decided that they would rather take photos of themselves rather than the scenery and selfies are all over social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've seen a number of selfie-centric phones - 5MP cameras are already pretty standard, but 8MP and even 13MP front-facers are available. Some of them even have their own LED flash (mostly single, some dual), which will help capture the moment on a night out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear cameras have also improved at a rapid pace. You can find phones with 720p HD video recording for under ?100.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, 4K or 2160p is all the rage these days.It captures a lot more detail (it works out to 8.3MP resolution, compared to 2.1MP for 1080p), but also requires much more storage - as much as three times more. If you have a 16GB phone with no microSD slot, you will need to regularly offload the videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chipset &amp; storage</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've listed the chipsets on the phones we recommend, but we don't expect you to know them by heart. Sure, you can Google them, but to make things easier we've listed three benchmark results - one for the CPU, one for the GPU and one for browsing performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The CPU bench is Basemark OS II 2.0, the GPU one is Basemark X (those are the benchmarks you can find on our specs pages). For the web test, we picked the general BrowserMark 2.1 bench.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android phone makers like to brag about the number of processor cores, but what they often don't tell you is that those are often low-power cores. So it's not always as simple as "8 &gt; 2," Apple's custom dual-core processor is much faster than an octa-core Cortex-A53 CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You shouldn't worry about the processor that much anyway, RAM and GPU can really be the deciders. For example, Snapdragon 615 has an octa-core processor and Adreno 405 GPU. It's a great midrange chipset, but it's asked to power some 1080p screens and the Adreno just doesn't cut it, it was meant for 720p screens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for RAM, 1GB is okay for the cheap devices, but the more RAM you have, the less often you'll app reloads you'll get as you multitask. The browser is also very memory intensive, older 1GB iPhones, for example, often have to reload tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's storage. The more the better, obviously, but beware of the labels. An 8GB phone can have as little as 5GB left available to you and part of that is for the installed apps. Losing 3GB is, unfortunately, one of the better deals - there are some 32GB phones that leave you only 25GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microSD card can really relieve storage pressure, but Google's meddling with how Android handles external storage has gotten really annoying - unless the phone maker modified the software, you may not be able to delete files from the microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second a smartphone runs out of power is the second it becomes an expensive paperweight. Battery capacity is like the chipset - if you get wowed by big numbers, you'll miss the all-important factor of efficiency.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've listed the battery life results from our reviews where available. The first rating is an estimate of how long you can go between charges. Then the breakdowns show how long a phone will last in calls, web-browsing and video playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally you want at least 48 hours of endurance, since the real-life longevity of the battery drops with just about every app installed. Heavy users will want to aim for 72 hours and more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Under ?100<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Smartphones have become commoditized and flagships have started losing their premium luster. We guess the upgrade treadmill that saw consumers buying a new expensive gadget every year or two just couldn't keep up the pace forever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Meanwhile smartphone accessories are selling better than ever. An after-market headset will be better than anything that comes in the box of all phones but the high-priced flagships. A cheap fitness armband with a heart rate monitor will do the job under most circumstances, while the built-in phone sensors hard to use while exercising.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And remember that an ugly phone in a pretty case looks the same as an attractive phone in a pretty case. So, as usual our advice is to shop smart and not fall for marketing tricks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's start with something simple. The Sony Xperia E3 came out late last year, but it's got enough bang for the buck to overlook its age. Widely available, this phone stands out in this class with LTE connectivity and optional dual-SIM support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4.5" screen is not too sharp but it's got decent viewing angles. The 5MP camera can record 1080p video, a rarity in this segment, though the quality is distinctly below flagship 1080p. One big issue is the built-in storage - 4GB doesn't go too far, you absolutely need a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A slightly newer alternative is the Huawei Y625. The phone has a bigger 5" screen and a sharper main camera at 8MP. It tops out at 720p though, it can't record 1080p video. Other than that, it's fairly close to the Xperia (including the 4GB storage, unfortunately). It's sold only as a dual-SIM phone (it's slightly cheaper than the Xperia E3 Dual) and there's no LTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia lineup is still competitive on the low-end, though not as dominant as it used to be. The Microsoft Lumia 535 from late last year is the most widely used Windows Phone. It has a 5" IPS screen that's marginally sharper than the Huawei's. Its 5MP camera is even more limited, topping out at 480p, though you do get a nice 5MP selfie cam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, you get double the storage out of the box, 8GB. There's no LTE though and dual-SIM is optional (the sub-?100 phone is single-SIM). At least the software update plan is clear - all aboard the Windows 10 Mobile train.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A more compact option is the Microsoft Lumia 532. It's essentially the same phone, except with a 4" screen. You lose the 5MP selfie cam (it has a VGA imager), but it's cheap enough for the dual-SIM version to slip under the ?100 mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PS. The Lumia 435 is another 4" option, but you don't save enough cash to make it worth going down to a dual-core processor (the 535 and 532 have quad-cores) and a 2MP fixed-focus camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We used to recommend the occasional Firefox OS phone here for color, but the platform hasn't made much progress. Meanwhile Samsung's Tizen jumped into fourth place, behind Windows. If that doesn't sound impressive, keep in mind that this is ahead of BlackBerry OS (not to mention Jolla and other hopefuls).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Z1 is the base model (we'll look at the higher-specced Z3 in the next chapter). The Z1 is small with a 4" screen and modestly spec'd, but it's made to run Tizen and does it well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What didn't make the cut<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here is a good place to mention some of the phones that didn't make the recommendation list. The Xiaomi Redmi 2 Prime is a cool phone with a 720p screen and a 64-bit chipset, plus an 8MP/1080p camera. Unfortunately, it is not widely available. The LG Tribute 2 with similar specs also caught our eye, but its availability is limited too. Same goes for the Yu Yuphoria and Lenovo A6000.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We usually recommend phones with a solid global footprint, although importing a phone is fairly straightforward these days. Still, you're potentially looking at a month of shipping time and limited or no warranty.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>?100-?200<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Tablets failed to kill the humble PC, but big phones are certainly capable of hurting a number of tablets. For less than ?200 you can get a 5.5" 1080p screen and enough processing power for proper multitasking. If you prefer something more compact, there's a solid choice of five-inchers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Early this year LG put out a few phones, which were not a part of its regular letter lineup. The LG Spirit is a surprisingly capable fighter that doesn?t fly far above the ?100 threshold. It has a good-quality screen, sharp and with good viewing angles, and a mid-range camera that shoots 8MP stills and 1080p videos. It even has a 64-bit Snapdragon 410 chipset, a popular choice in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that this is the H440N version, the H420 version undoes some of the good ? it drops to a 5MP camera and a 32-bit MediaTek chipset. It's still a good phone, just not as good as its cousin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A slightly bigger option is the LG Magna, which has a 5" 720p screen instead. It builds on the Spirit with optional dual-SIM connectivity and a 5MP selfie cam. It comes only with 32-bit chipsets though and there's a single-SIM, non-LTE version so be careful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 630 is just a little over ?100, but the Microsoft Lumia 640 is worth the extra bucks so we jumped straight to it. It has a 5" 720p screen, bigger and sharper than the 630, and a better camera setup ? 8MP main camera that shoots 1080p videos, plus a 720p selfie cam. The chipset is the same, but you get double the RAM at 1GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're looking specifically at the 3G, dual-SIM model, though the Lumia 640 comes in any combination of 3G or 4G and single or dual-SIM, so pick your poison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This model has a phablet-sized option too, the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL. It bumps up the screen size to 5.7", keeping the 720p resolution. Most of the other specs are the same, but the camera gets a noticeable upgrade ? a bigger, sharper 13MP sensor with a Carl Zeiss lens (a premium feature) and a 5MP/1080p selfie cam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with the other 640?s, the Lumia 640 XL lets you pick and choose 3G or 4G, single or dual-SIM (with prices varying accordingly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A similar duo is the Meizu m2 team. The Meizu m2 has a 5" 720p screen like the Lumia 640, but tops it with a 64-bit processor and a better camera ? 13MP rear and 5MP front. It's a dual-SIM phone with LTE, the same combo on the Lumia will be pricier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m2 note pumps up the screen to 5.5" 1080p and boosts the chipset performance with double the CPU cores (eight) and more GPU power. It also offers a 32GB option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that both these Meizus run Flyme 4.5, a very comprehensive skin over Android 5.1 Lollipop. Changes to Android run so deep that it may look alien to users in the Western hemisphere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At roughly the same price, the Lenovo K3 Note has essentially the same specs: a 5.5" 1080p screen, an octa-core 64-bit chipset with 2GB of RAM, 13MP/1080p main camera and so on. It does have a separate microSD slot though, so you can use two SIMs and expanded storage (which the m2 note can't). It has the same quirky UI though, this time called "Lenovo Vibe 2.0."</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unveiled only a few days ago, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 surprises with its low price and capable specs. Like the other two, it has a 5.5" 1080p screen and an octa-core processor ? a MediaTek Helio X10, which has a pretty solid GPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it offers above the K3 Note and m2 note is a fingerprint reader on the back, the metal back. That's right, the Redmi Note 3 offers premium build and features, all at a highly affordable price. No NFC means no Android Pay though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto G 2nd gen belongs in this category, but we think the price premium of the Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) is worth it. It's one of the most affordable phones with waterproofing (IPX7, good for up to 1m underwater for half an hour).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to its predecessor, it upgrades to a 64-bit chipset and has a version with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, in addition to the standard 1GB/8GB model. The camera makes a noticeable jump forward too, going up to 13MP/1080p and bringing a 5MP selfie camera with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, if you were looking at the Moto E, it's a nice phone but keep in mind that it has been locked out of the Marshmallow update. And that would?ve been one of the major reasons to go with Motorola over other makers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here at the office we have our fair share of AMOLED screens ? the perfect blacks look great at night and these screens generally have better contrast too (color accuracy can vary significantly across models). So we thought about including the Galaxy J2, one of the cheapest AMOLED-equipped phones but it's probably not worth it just for the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, the Samsung Galaxy J5 is by no means cheap for the specs it offers, but unlike the J2 it is a capable phone on its own. And it has a 5" Super AMOLED screen of 720p resolution. The camera department boasts a 13MP/1080p main shooter and a 5MP selfie cam with its own LED flash. On the connectivity side there's LTE and optional dual-SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To round things off, a decent 64-bit chipset with 1.5GB of RAM runs the Android 5.1 Lollipop. It shapes up to be good competition to the Moto G (3rd gen) if you value the screen over things like waterproofing. It's not clear if/when the Galaxy J5 will get Marshmallow though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can have the same 5" 720p Super AMOLED screen at a much lower cost with the new Samsung Z3. It's a Tizen phone and the specs are slightly lower, e.g. 1GB of RAM instead of 1.5GB, an 8MP camera instead of 13MP and no LTE. You still get dual-SIM and a 5MP selfie cam though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What didn?t make the cut<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here are the phones that didn?t get the nod in this category. The Moto E (2nd gen) was skipped for its Marshmallow-less future. Without that, it really belongs inthe sub-?100 euro category. Its friend, the Moto G (2nd gen) is getting the 6.0 update and we like its stereo speakers, though the 3rd gen model is really worth the extra few bucks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy J2 appeals with a Super AMOLED screen, but we'd rather pay extra for the J5 or settle for a Tizen-powered Z3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another Samsung, the Galaxy On5 is a recent addition to the 5" crowd, but its availability is limited and we don't feel it offers enough over, say, an LG Magna or a Meizu m2 to import one. The Galaxy On7 is available in the same regions, but its 5.5" 720p screen lags behind the Meizu m2 note and Lenovo K3 Note, while the rest of the specs offer no meaningful improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy A3 belongs to a higher-end series than the J-crew, but at basically the same price the Galaxy J5 is better than the A3 (bigger, sharper screen, higher-res main camera and selfie flash). It is super thin and light though ? 6.9mm and 110g ? so if you value compactness, then go for the A3 over the J5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other notable mentions are Microsoft's Lumia 540 and Lumia 550. The Lumia 640 easily trumps them in terms of specs and the newer Lumia 550 isn't ahead on software updates.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?200-?300<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Things start to get genuinely premium now, several offerings boast metal frames and even unibodies, we even venture into QHD screens, 2160p video and 3 gigs of RAM. The 5" phones in the previous chapter were behind the phablets inthe feature race, here you'll find several beefier options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu m1 metal is actually closer to the m2 note than the m1 (in some regions it's known as Blue Charm Metal). Its unibody is made of aluminum alloy cast using a special method, but we didn?t love the final result ? it feels closer to polycarbonate than metal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is well-spec?d though. The 5.5" 1080p screen is a bit dim and contrast isn?t all that great, but at least does okay in the sun. The MediaTek Helio X10 chipset provides premium performance though, especially in the GPU department (where the m2 note was lacking). Getting used to Flyme/YunOS may take a while though (which one you get depends on the region).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most powerful phones we've seen so far tended to have 5.5+ inch screens, so here's a beefy 5-incher. The Xiaomi Mi 4i has a 5" 1080p screen and an octa-core processor (Cortex-A53 based, but still). Its 13MP camera shoots 1080p video, pretty standard so far.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It costs a bit more, but the Xiaomi Mi 4c steps up its game with Snapdragon 808 (it swaps four A53 cores for two A57s and adds a much better GPU). This one also has a 3GB version (paired with 32GB storage). Note that neither of these has a card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the original version, Mi 4, has an older (but still good) Snapdragon 801 chipset and a 64GB option. The main camera can record 2160p video and it has an 8MP selfie cam. This one can be difficult to find though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another powerful 5-incher is the OnePlus X and it has an AMOLED screen to boot. It features a metal frame and glass back, Europe is getting an exclusive ceramic version too. It's powered by Snapdragon 801 and has a 13MP/1080p camera, a throwback to the Samsung Galaxy S4 LTE-A.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It tops that 2013 model with dual-SIM and an 8MP selfie camera though. Also, the S4 is from Samsung's plastic era, so this one feels more premium. If you want LTE you should study the supported bands though, the OnePlus X does not work well in the US.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another option is the Huawei Honor 6. It has a 5" 1080p display (an LCD) and adds some old-school oomph with four Cortex-A15 CPU cores plus four A7s. They are 32-bit cores, but fast. The update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow has already been scheduled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've recently seen some killer deals on the LG G2. It hails from the distant 2013, but will go toe to toe with the OnePlus X and Honor 6. For one, it packs a bigger 5.2" screen in the same footprint (it is noticeably thicker though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It uses almost the same chipset and its 13MP camera has Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). There's no microSD slot though and only 32GB storage maximum (16GB is the base). Note that the Verizon version supports GSM networks and can sometimes be found for less (do make sure it supports the right frequencies ).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want something more modern and capable (or couldn?t find a good deal on the G2), the LG G3 is a pretty great phone. One of the first with a QHD screen, it smears the line between "phone" and "phablet" with a 5.5" display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It also improved the camera with phase detection and laser autofocus plus 2160p video capture. And it added a microSD slot! The chipset is mostly the same, though there's an option with 3GB of RAM (the 32GB one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While looking at the LG G3, have a look at the LG G Flex2 as well. It has seen a significant price cut and both cost practically the same. This one has a curved, bendable 5.5" P-OLED display and self-healing coating on the back, pretty unique features. And it's powered by a Snapdragon 810 chipset, instead of the 808.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not all good news though, the screen isn?t as sharp - 1080p, 403ppi (which is still a big improvement over the original Flex). Also, this is a first-gen S810 chipset and it has issues with overheating, which impact performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the LG G Flex2 is a pretty unique phone. Maybe the compromises weren?t worth it when it launched at a full flagship price, but at under ?300 it sure is tempting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What didn?t make the cut<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We left out some interesting devices here ? they have a niche, but it's too narrow for a general recommendation. The LG G4 Stylus is a mid-ranger (despite its name), but it has a roomier screen ? 5.7" ? and a stylus. It's not as functional as Galaxy Note's S Pen, but this is fairly affordable. And you still get a 13MP camera with laser AF and OIS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It may not have the specs of a G4, but it sure is priced like one. Not much of a deal for a 720p screen (a low 258ppi) and a mid-range chipset ? either octa or a quad-core processor. RAM is good/bad too, you get either 2GB or 1GB, depending on the model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alcatel OneTouch Go Play belongs in the sub-?200 category, going on specs, but it's an adventure phone. It has a water-resistance rating, which covers salt water too. IPX7 like the Moto G (3rd gen) has is for fresh water only. The Go Play has a case to which you can attach a GoPro camera and use the phone as a viewfinder for it. The phone itself has an 8MP/1080p camera on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE500KL ? that's the 5" one, there are other models with 5.5" screens ? it may have a 13MP camera with laser autofocus but if that's what you want, LG has plenty of models in this price range. The 5" 720p screen and quad-core processor aren?t particularly impressive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy A5 offers a 5" 720p screen but, as with the A3, the Galaxy J5 is the better offer. What about the Galaxy J7 then? It bumps up the Super AMOLED screen to 5.5", but keeps the resolution at 720p, which isn?t much. For 5.5 inches of OLED, we'd go with an LG G Flex2, even if it has its flaws it's still a former flagship.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?300-?400<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Absolutely unintended, this chapter turned out to be a haven for the fans of AMOLED. Also, for the most part it's filled with large phones, screens ranging from 5.5" to 6". The few compact phones that made the list are heavy hitters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Meizu MX5 is a powerhouse. It starts big ? a 7.6mm metal body housing a 5.5" AMOLED display ? and ends big ? a large 1/2.3" sensor that shoots 20.7MP stills and 2160p videos. The chipset is well stocked too, though the lack of a microSD slot puts the 16GB option in question. The 32GB and 64GB ones should be okay though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A little less-capable, but more in touch with Android updates ? near-stock Android at that ? is the Motorola Moto X Play. Its 5.5" 1080p screen is an LCD and the phone has a plastic exterior. It does have a water-repellant nano-coating (IP52), not as good as the Moto G, but it reduces the risk of water damage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera produces high-resolution stills, 21MP, though the video tops out at 1080p. A dual-SIM version is available if you need it. By the way, there are no stereo speakers, this is just Moto's design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swinging back to AMOLED, the Samsung Galaxy A7 comes with a 5.5" Super AMOLED screen of 1080p resolution. The Snapdragon 615 chipset doesn?t quite live up to the Helio X10 (mostly in the GPU department) and the camera is a regular 13MP/1080p.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, the Galaxy A7 is ridiculously thin at 6.3mm and has a metal frame (with a plastic back).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asus Zenfone 2 ZE551ML impresses with up to 4GB of RAM (though there are 2GB versions) and an Intel chipset (the CPU is 2.3GHz and 1.8GHz respectively). There's all the storage in the world too, this model goes up to 64GB plus a microSD slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zenfone 2 Deluxe (also ZE551ML) starts at 64GB, but goes up to 128GB and even 256GB. That's the most you can have in a mobile device, especially if you add a 200GB microSD. This one also comes with an attractive tessellated back, though it is pricier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For all that memory, the camera is pretty basic ? 13MP/1080p main camera and 5MP selfie camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>5.5" is big, 6" is bigger. The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra has a 6" 1080p screen and loves selfies ? it has a 13MP camera with autofocus and LED flash on the front, one of the best we've seen. And the same specs for the camera on the back. Unlike some of the other phones, this one is on the waiting list for Android 6.0 Marshmallow. It comes in dual-SIM flavor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's do a 180 and go smaller with the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact. This petite phone hasa 4.6" 720p screen and an impressive camera ? the same 1/2.3" sensor with 20.7MP resolution and 2160p video like the big Z3. It uses a Snapdragon 801 chipset, which may be long in the tooth, but its GPU is still good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z3 Compact boasts IP68 waterproofing, the best yet. The 8 means it can dive beyond 1m for over half an hour. This one also packs stereo speakers on the front, unlike to Motorolas. The battery life is amazing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another phone that can brave the elements is the Samsung Galaxy S5. Yep, last year's flagship, which tried to fight the Xperias on their turf. Samsung decided beauty trumps waterproofing for the 2015 generation. The S5 still looks better than the rugged Active phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not as small as the Z3 Compact, but it boasts a sharper screen ? 5.1" 1080p Super AMOLED. It uses the same chipset and the 16MP camera has a fairly large sensor of its own (1/2.6"). With it, Samsung debuted phase detection autofocus on mobile devices.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What didn?t make the cut<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C5 Ultra has an impressive selfie camera and if that's your speed then have a look at the Asus Zenfone Selfie ZD551KL. The 13MP/1080p camera has dual-tone flash, for more color-accurate photos of your mug.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's more compact than the C5 Ultra with a 5.5" screen and there's an option with 3GB of RAM. Still, it's pricier than the Xperia, a premium that's worth it if you are a selfie machine, but not so much otherwise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We skipped over another 5.5"/1080p offering, the Huawei G8. It has a thin (7.5mm) metal body and a fingerprint reader on the back. The 13MP main camera isn?t that impressive compared to say the Moto X Play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, it has the same chipset, an optional 3GB of RAM and an update to Android 6.0 Marshmallow has been promised. Add that to the much prettier exterior and we may have a winner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZTE Nubia Z9 mini would have found its place between the Xperia Z3 Compact and Galaxy S5, though the Snapdragon 615 chipset isn?t on their level. This oneis looking lower down, at the OnePlus X, for a competitor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The vivo X5Pro impresses with its 6.4mm chassis, the 5.2" 1080p AMOLED sounds pretty great. If the Galaxy S5 isn't pretty enough, this one is a good alternative, but you do sacrifice chipset and camera performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ZUK Z1 launched recently and itjumped straight into the 5.5"/1080p market on the back of a Snapdragon 801 chipset. The 13MP camera has OIS and you get a nice 8MP/1080p selfie camera. A fingerprint reader and a USB-Type C makes this an even more interesting device, though it's a bit pricy right now ? an LG G3 sounds better.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?400-?500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In this price range, we're shopping for the best, but still keeping an eye on the price. It's hard to fault the phones here, so we get really nit-picky, even tiny imperfections are pointed out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A lot pricier than the preceding G3 but well deserved. The LG G4 keeps the basic screen specs ? 5.5" QHD ? but noticeably improves the quality. The camera is one of the best in the 2015 generation, another big improvement from the former model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slightly curved design of the G4 helps protect its screen from face-down falls and is a rare shape (shared to an extent with the G Flex). By the way, we think the basic plastic back is a regression from the G3, but the optional leather backs instantly give the phone a more premium feel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of many HTC phones released this year is a direct competitor and at the right price too. The HTC One E9+ has a 5.5" QHD screen and an impressive camera of its own. No OIS, but the main shooter has a 20MP sensor, while the selfie cam does 13MP photos (in some regions only 4MP though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's trademark stereo speakers flank the screen. The One E9+ is powered by the MediaTek Helio X10 chipset, which isn?t the fastest, but you get 3GB of RAM and expandable 32GB of storage. Soon the phone will be running Android 6.0 Marshmallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's late 2014 flagship, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 adds a stylus to the phablet formula. It works with its 5.7" Super AMOLED screen thanks to an additional digitizer, courtesy of Wacom (makers of professional drawing tablets).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 4 features a metal frame and faux-leather back and was made before Samsung decided to seal in the battery and drop the microSD slot. It also has a Snapdragon 805 chipset, which may be 32-bit bbut has great performance for the class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 16MP camera boasts OIS and 2160p video, while the selfie cam has enough resolution to record QHD video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Motorola's effort in this field, the Moto X Style,has a 5.7" QHD screen too, but an IPS LCD one. Its feature list draws may parallels - it uses Snapdragon 808 like the LG G4, stereo speakers around the front like the One E9+, IP52-certified water-repellent treatment like the Moto G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Style has a 21MP with phase detection autofocus and a 5MP selfie cam with its own flash. Its Marshmallow update is already on the calendar. Also, if you have a Moto Maker available in your region, you can add a leather back. Or a wooden one. Your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's break off from the established players for abit and look at the ZTE Axon Elite. ZTE has several slightly different Elites around the world, so check which one is available in your area. This one in particular is on the lower end of the ?400-?500 segment.   It has a 5.5" 1080p screen paired with a Snapdragon 810 chipset. The design is pretty interesting, with a metal back adorned with faux leather top and bottom panels. There's a dual-camera on the back ? 13MP for photos and 2160p videos plus 2MP for depth effects. Also here is a fingerprint reader.On the front is an 8MP selfie cam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just for a reference, the Axon Pro and Axon Lux both have 5.5" QHD screens and 4GB of RAM. The Lux also packs 128GB of storage. You pay a premium on both of them, of course (and the Pro lacks the fingerprint reader).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're on the prowl for something smaller, the Samsung Galaxy S6 has worked its way down to less than ?500. It's a massive shift in Samsung design, featuring an attractive slim chassis made of metaland sandwiched between glass panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fingerprint reader works much better than on the S5 and the new Samsung Pay service has been picking up steam ? your smartphone can now replace your credit/debit card. Even an old-school one with a magnetic strip ? that's something not even the iPhone can do, Apple Pay is NFC-only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung also improved the screen by making it sharper and enhancing color accuracy, the chipset is the fastest Android is likely to see this year and the camera also further improves on the S5 camera. The big change is the addition of OIS and a wider f/1.9 aperture, the camera module sticks out a good deal out of the back though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you have extra cash to burn, the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge is mostly the same phone, but its unique dual-curved display really improves the looks. It doesn?t do much for usability, but again, it's an eye-catcher.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you miss the water resistance of the Galaxy S5, then the Xperia Z series can pick up the slack. The Sony Xperia Z3+ is worth the price premium over the slightly older Z3. It's marginally thinner and lighter, also it jumps from an S801 to an S810 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new SoC brings faster LTE with it and the selfie camera was updated to something more modern. The screen improves sunlight legibility, even though it loses some points on contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Z3+ generation never got a Compact, but that's okay ? the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact is under ?500. We were a bit disappointed that Sony kept the 4.6" 720p screen, the Z-s seem slow to adopt new display tech. Anyway, you get the Snapdragon 810 chipset like the big guys.It is saddled with just 2GB of RAM though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the plus side, the camera is even better than the Z3+. With the Z5 generation Sony finally did a big overhaul of the camera, it now features a 23MP sensor with fast phase detection. Also, you get a fingerprint reader, which is missing in the Z3/Z3+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As with all Xperia Z phones, the Xperia Z5 Compact features front-facing stereo speakers and a waterproof body. It's just that we happen to like the Z3 Compact body better than this one.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>What didn?t make the cut<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google is a bit blind when it comes to non-US availability of its hardware. If Europe is lucky enough to get its shiny new gadget, it's asked to pay a ridiculous price for it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example, the Motorola Nexus 6 is an excellent phone with a great 6" QHD AMOLED screen, stereo speakers and basic water resistance. And in the US it's available at a great price too. The European price is 50% higher, making ita non-starter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the same story with the LG Nexus 5X. While the phone lost some of its geek-cred compared to the 2013 model, it's an excellent piece of kit and the new 12.3MP camera does wonders in the dark, both for photos and videos. It's just thatits way overpriced in Europe. It's a great deal in the US though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei has a couple of metal-clad phones that almost made the list. The Honor 7 has a 5.2" 1080p screen and a 20MP camera with phase detection AF, an 8MP selfie cam and a fingerprint reader. An excellent competitor to the Xperia Z3+ (did we mention it will get updated to Marshmallow too?), except that its main camera tops out at 1080p. The Kirin 935 chipset doesn?t quite live up to the heated competition of Snapdragon 810 and Exynos 7420.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Mate S is similar, all-aluminum and with a fingerprint reader on the back. Better still, it has a 5.5" AMOLED screen. With only 1080p resolution though and the camera is somehow less impressive than the Honor 7?s, 13MP stills and 1080p video. It does have OIS and the 8MP selfie camera has flash, but that's just not enough to make the difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ofthe runner-up phones here, the Meizu PRO 5 most deserves to have made the list.It boasts a 5.7" AMOLED screen, but disappoints with only 1080p resolution. The camera is pretty great though, based on a fairly large 21MP sensor with phase detection AF and that can do 2160p video. And it uses Samsung's beastly Exynos 7420 chipset. It will do better on benchmarks than the Galaxy Note 4, but that one has the better screen (plus S Pen) and OIS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>?500 and over<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's throw caution and budget constraints out of the window and seek out the best mobile hardware you can find outside of research labs. Nothing but the most amazing phones will do here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After a long, long wait, Microsoft finally unveiled new Windows flagships. The more compact of the two, the Microsoft Lumia 950 has a 5.2" AMOLED screen of QHD resolution and a Snapdragon 808 chipset. Why pay a premium over the Galaxy S6?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, the 20MP PureView camera with Carl Zeiss optics and optical image stabilization, plus triple LED light is highly impressive. Nokia (now Microsoft) really paved the way for high-quality mobile cameras, even their audio was leagues ahead (Androids are catching up though).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Windows 10 Mobile may be the less popular OS, but Microsoft's new Continuum puts a new spin on things. With the right adapter (given away in the US, ?100 in Europe), you can get a desktop Windows experience. Sure, it's more Windows RT (that is no x86 apps), but it can really boost productivity when you have a full size keyboard and mouse. If you have them, unlike the Surface and other tablets, carrying a keyboard with your phone isn?t easy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger version, the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL, has a 5.7" AMOLED display of QHD resolution. It also bumps up the chipset to Snapdragon 810. Note that both Lumias have liquid cooling, a feature borrowed from the Surface team to keep the cores from over-heating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Androids and iPhones rely on fingerprints for added security, but the Lumia 950 and 950 XL use Windows Hello, which uses an iris scanner instead. So, your face (eyes specifically) is your unlock code.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, if it's impressive camera you want, the big Sony Xperia Z5 brings the revamped Exmor RS shooter. It ups the screen to 1080p resolution ? better than the 720p on the Z5 Compact, but still behind the competition ? and the RAM to a more acceptable 3GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the others here, the Xperia Z5 has IP68 water resistance rating. It also has stereo speakers and a microSD slot going for it, plus Sony's good track record of updating Android on its flagships. The Z5 model has highly impressive digital image stabilization, much better than the one on the Z3+ and rivaling some hardware OIS implementations (you lose field of view, but the Z5 camera is very wide so it's not an issue).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 950 XL is an impressive device, but it has to beat the Samsung Galaxy Note5 for a place in your pocket. A 5.7" QHD Super AMOLED screen comes with a stylus, the familiar S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note5 has the faster chipset, Exynos 7420, more RAM at 4GB, and Samsung's excellent multitasking interface, which the Lumia lacks (we're talking about multitasking on the phone itself). The camera is an improvement over the Note 4 camera. It's lower res than the PureView shooter, but has the same size pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the Galaxy S6, this one comes with a great fingerprint reader and Samsung Pay with the ability to emulate magnetic strip credit/debit cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A very similar device is the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+, except that, as its name suggests it has a dual-curved screen like the smaller S6 edge. Unlike the Galaxy Note Edge from last year, this one does not come with a stylus, so S Pen fans beware.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy S6 edge+ plus does look prettier than the Note5, but as with the S6/S6 edge you're paying a hefty premium for looks and not much practicality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another AMOLED screen comes with the Motorola Moto X Force package (aka the Droid Trubo 2 for Verizon in the US). It has a 5.4" QHD display and an impressive camera of its own ? 21MP with phase detection AF and 2160p video, plus a 5MP selfie camera with its own flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Moto X Force is billed as the Shatterproof phone and various drop tests confirm that the dual-pane glass on the front takes hitting the pavement like a champ. Note that the phone isn?t waterproof though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we reach Apple's smartphones. We passed by the iPhone 6 duo, but since you're paying top dollar (or euro or whatever) you may as well get the latest model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 6s is one of the few remaining top-specced compact phones, even if it is not Xperia Z Compact compact. The all-aluminum body has its fans and Apple upped the horsepower ? you get one of the very best mobile chipsets with more RAM than before and the camera finally jumped on the 2160p bandwagon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new 12MP camera produces higher-resolution stills though we found out the improvement in image quality isn?t quite 50%. The video got a big boost though (yet still no stereo sound). Apple introduced Apple Pay, its own payment service that has the widest coverage of the three competing services (Samsung and Android being the other two).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 6s Plus is Apple's second generation phablet. It has a notably sharper 5.5" screen (though still no match for the QHD crowd). The screens of both the 6s and the 6s Plus have Force Touch ? the ability to measure the pressure on the screen and respond accordingly, a right click of touchscreens. Some Android makers have been quick to adopt this new feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>What didn?t make the cut<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Nexus 6P is easily the best Nexus so far, but again we skipped it due to the ridiculous pricing policy outside of the US. It's the first all-metal Nexus and it has a great 5.7" QHD AMOLED screen, proper stereo speakers too (unlike the LG). It also upgrades to a Snapdragon 810 chipset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new camera is amazingly good in the dark and you get an 8MP/1080p selfie cam. It's a great device (not counting the lack of a microSD slot). It's around the same price as a Galaxy Note5, so it's certainly not out of reach, but it should have been cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new LG V10 is a pretty unique device. Its dual-screen enhances notifications, giving much more detail than a simple status LED. The dual selfie camera is pretty interesting too, though having seen 13MP cams with their own flash, its wide-angle lens (120°) doesn?t quite make up for the 5MP resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is very good, using the LG G4 hardware with some bespoke features and the most extensive set of manual controls. The problem is that the LG G4 will be updated with these features too and it's much, much more affordable. The rubbery back on the V10 is there for extra durability (the phone is built to withstand falls), but the leather back on the G4 feels more premium despitebeing actually cheaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you thought QHD was impressive, wait till you hear about Sony's 4K display. The Sony Xperia Z5 Premium has a 5.5" display with as much resolution as your 55" 2160p TV. It mostly works in multimedia apps though, the rest of the time the UI is rendered at 1080p and upscaled. That doesn?t quite justify the price premium over the regular Z5, which has essentially the same specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC tried to revive its ailing business with the HTC One A9, a new direction in design for the company. It draws comparisons with the iPhone, even though HTC argues this is actually their design and Apple borrowed from them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the US, the A9 was basically at the same price as the Nexus 5X, but offers a 5" 1080p AMOLED display, and a 13MP camera with OIS. The midrange Snapdragon 617 chipset is a deal-breaker though, it can't even do 2160p video. And in Europe its pricing is nothing short of outrageous, which is the reason this otherwise fine phone wound up in Also ran category in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We made it all this way without BlackBerry, so let's close on one. The new BlackBerry Priv is unique in several ways ? it's BB's first Android phone and it's the first Android, strike that, first high-end smartphone to come with a slide-out hardware QWERTY.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Priv is built to heavy-weight specs. It has a 5.4" AMOLED QHD screen and an 18MP camera with Schneider-Kreuznach optics, OIS and phase-detection autofocus. It's powered by an S808 chipset like the LG V10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's very expensive though, rivaling even the iPhones and the BlackBerry-infused Android isn?t quite ready for prime time yet.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's that time of the year again where price cuts will make you consider changing your phone even if you didn't think you needed one last month. Rest assured, we've been there. It's also the season of giving and while for the most part we stick to smart bands and classic watches, sometimes an older smartphone might actually turn out to be a great present for a close relative, who doesn't insist on having the latest and greatest and in these cases, we would gladly oblige.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What we mean to say is that while curiosity may take you to the ?500+ page, a ?200 or so smartphone will probably be a fine purchase too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The opposite is quite true as well - a modern smartphone rivals computers in performance and digital cameras in image quality, so going up the pricing ladder usually gets you a device that's this much better. You just have to find the rung of the ladder where the product will be good enough for you. If today's flagships are too much, usually last year's version of the same model will almost always do the job. If it's still too expensive, go back another year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the end, whatever phone you settle on, just make sure to pick one you will enjoy.</paragraph>
