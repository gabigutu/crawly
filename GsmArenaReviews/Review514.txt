			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update: voting is now closed! Which phone hides behind which letter is revealed on Page 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are many contenders to the title of "best phone camera" and today we have three of the latest and certainly, some of the best-known. The Apple iPhone 6s, Samsung Galaxy S6 and Sony Xperia Z5 will compete on more than just camera tomorrow in our three-way comparison, but today they take part in our blind camera shootout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You should know how it works by now - we present you with anonymized camera samples and you pick the one you like best. This way voting happens without existing affections and preconceptions about how good each camera is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for our contenders, we're glad Apple finally left the 8MP camera age. The iPhone 6s brings a 12MP camera with f/2.2 aperture and 4K video capture (a first for an Apple device). It's the only phone here with a dual-LED flash, but the smaller iPhone still doesn't share in the Plus' OIS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung widened aperture down to f/1.9 and settled on a 16:9 sensor. The Galaxy S6 also brought in optical image stabilization system, which will help out in videos (in tomorrow's full article we'll include a stabilization test too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony split the difference in aspect ratio and went with a Nokia-style hybrid sensor. It shoots 23MP photos in 4:3 mode and 20MP photos in 16:9 mode. Also, a brand new electronic image stabilization is on board as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that for this blind test we've downscaled the photos to 1,600 x 1,200px, otherwise it would have been very obvious which photo came from which phone. Don't worry though, we're including 100% crops for a closer look at the quality before you cast your vote and you'll get the chance to see the full res shots tomorrow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cast your vote for each scene using the widgets below the samples. You have roughly 24 hours to vote (we will close the polls around 2pm UK time).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Scene #1: still camera, daylight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We kick things off with a couple of photos taken during the day. We suggest you focus on detail and color here, we'll look at dynamic range in the next chapter. We've included 100% crops for pixel peepers since, again, the camera samples have been downscaled to 1,600 x 1,200px to conceal which phone is which.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Scene #2: still camera, daylight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here's a second daylight shot. Light here was a bit less favorable and there are deep shadows, so you can judge digital noise in the shadows.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Scene #3: still camera, dynamic range<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For the next shot, the sun was shining bright, but a tall building was cast a deep shadow. That's areal stress test for the dynamic range of each camera. We included the histograms to help you out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bright part of the scene is exposed just fine, but what happens in the shadows? Notice how the trees disappear into the shade in one of the photos. Which phone could have done that?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Scene #4: still camera, dusk<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We waited until the sun started to set and snapped a few images. Here's one at dusk. We included shutter speed and ISO, since the EXIF has been scrubbed from the sample images. The Galaxy S6 has OIS, so maybe it used it to drop the shutter speed. Or maybe one of the other two took their time in order to keep ISO (and noise) low. So, what do you think?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Scene #5: still camera, flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We picked a subject by for the flash test. These were taken after the shots above and by that time it has gotten quite dark already. Only the iPhone 6s has a dual-tone, dual-LED flash. On paper it should be obvious which shot below was taken by Apple's darling, but is it?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Scene #6: 4K video, daylight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Okay, let's move on to moving pictures. 4K video is the standard for a modern flagship, and even Apple made the jump. Here are a few frames from the videos shot by the three phones.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Scene #7: 1080p video, daylight<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Full HD is still the most popular resolution, it's more sparing on your storage and not everyone has a 4K TV yet so why even bother you'd say. Also, 1080p allows phones to go up to 60fps for smoother actions. For this comparison we used the 30fps videos, but we'll include 1080p @ 60fps samples in the big shootout.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Scene #8: 4K video, dusk<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We recorded some 4K footage at dusk, before the sun had completely set. Even so the three phones found it challenging. Maybe the trio will do better at 1080p?</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The phone identities and the crowd favorites will be revealed tomorrow in roughly 24h from now, which would mean around 2-3pm London time. We also plan on publishing a detailed comparison of the three where many of the questions will be answered. Until then, enjoy these photo samples and cast your votes.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Blind test: the reveal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Fingers off the mice everyone, the voting is now over. You had 24 hours to judge the best quality, now it's time to reveal the lucky winner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PHONE A: Samsung Galaxy S6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PHONE B: Apple iPhone 6s</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PHONE C: Sony Xperia Z5</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, many of you correctly guessed which phone is which. The wide-angle lens of the Xperia Z5 proved to be a dead giveaway. Here's what how the fields of view compare between the three devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now the results. The Xperia Z5 has an overwhelming lead for still photography during the day. Things swing in favor of the Samsung Galaxy S6, whose wide aperture and OIS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPhone 6s takes its first win with daytime 1080p video, though it seems that Apple has a lot to work on when it comes to 4K. The camera scored a landslide victory in the dark though, beating even the Galaxy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the full resolution shots, now that we're not concealing the resolution. You'll notice that some Galaxy S6 photos are 4:3. We shot them in that mode (12MP) to make them harder to tell apart from the 12MP photos from the iPhone. There was no easy way to conceal the Xperia Z5 shots though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You've had your say, ours is coming in shortly. We're finishing up a full three-way fight between the iPhone 6s, Galaxy S6 and Xperia Z5 that will go beyond the camera - hardware, screen, software, audio and so on. There will be more details on the camera too, so check back soon!</paragraph>
