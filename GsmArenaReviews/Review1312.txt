		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As 3D is taking over theaters and living rooms around the world, the craze is hitting handheld too. The next thing to shake up the business or on the way to irrelevance: geeks will geek about it either way. Now that the HTC EVO 3D has grown a GSM radio, they get ready to enjoy a real 3D clash of the flagships. It doesn?t get any better than two heavyweight fighters battling it out, and someone?s got the 3D video to prove it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The best part is the HTC EVO 3D, like the LG Optimus 3D, is not placing all its chips on the stereoscopic screen and pair of cameras. No sir, each of those smartphones claims to have the best there is for power and speed. We are talking mighty dual-core CPUs, loads of RAM and superb connectivity. The EVO 3D can be your kind of smartphone even if you don?t care about 3D stills and videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things are certainly looking promising here, but smartphones are past the my-spec-sheet-is-longer-than-yours stage as of a few years. It?s all about the user experience now and, while powerful hardware is the first step towards providing it, you need equally good software if you are to challenge the best on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A massive high-res screen certainly looks good on paper, but it takes inspiration and clever design to beat those Super AMOLEDs and those Retinas. A new Adreno GPU with a major speed boost might seem more than anyone will ever need, but competitors have not been sitting around either so it?s always going to be close. And you cannot say whether the EVO 3D has the spark by just looking at the specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hope a full review would bring you a whole lot closer to finding the answers you need, so let?s get started. The EVO 3D gets unboxed right after the break.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package is good, but not perfect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D is a high-end phone and as such you?d expect it to come with a pretty well stuffed box. It does deliver to a point: you get adequate storage in the form of an 8GB microSD card, there?s a microUSB cable to use for computer connections and with the charger head.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A single-piece headset completes what is by all standards a decent list. Yet, given the MHL connectivity of the EVO 3D, an HDMI cable would have certainly made sense. A carrying pouch would?ve also come in handy, in helping you protect your precious new smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fairness though, none of the competitors offers a better package so we won?t be taking any points away from the HTC EVO 3D.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC EVO 3D 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The glasses-free 3D screens are obviously still quite a bit of a stretch for smartphones at this point. The EVO 3D is nearly a millimeter thicker than the Sensation. In fact, at 126 x 65 x 12.1 mm, the 3D smartphone is the thickest of all dual-core smartphones currently on the market. The 170 grams of weight are quite a load compared to some of the competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design is impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D is quite an imposing handset, and not without some distinct design accents. The huge screen is usually enough to make a smartphone a looker, but we have a black metal frame here to maximize the ?wow? effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And even though the handset be quite large and heavy it is only 2 grams heavier than the Optimus 3D, which should be the first and most important point of reference. The LG smartphone is also just 0.2mm slimmer and a bit taller and wider than the HTC flagship so it?s pretty much a tie.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And the back of the EVO 3D is pretty cool too. It might be all plastic, but the pattern of fine diagonal lines gives it texture and looks good. Even the faux gold-painted frame surrounding the dual camera deck somehow fits in here. By the way, the pair of camera lenses curiously makes the whole thing look like a compact tape-recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The exposed USB port on the left is probably the only design solution that we?re not particularly fond of, Overall though, we quite like the EVO 3D exterior. Had it been as slim as the Galaxy S II, the HTC new flagship would have been close to perfection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>3D screen left to do the talking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We now turn our attention to the HTC EVO 3D?s key feature, the stereoscopic LCD screen of qHD resolution (960 x 560 pixels). Just like with the LG Optimus 3D, you get the glasses-free stereoscopic effect using the parallax-barrier technology. That?s an extra screen layer that makes sure each eye sees a different set of pixels, giving a sense of depth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The technology however does have a few downsides worth mentioning. For one, it only works in landscape mode and each eye gets only half of the screen?s horizontal resolution. Also, to be able to enjoy it fully you will need to find the sweet spot between your eyes and the handset's screen, which is different for everyone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our subjective impression of the HTC EVO 3D screen is that the stereoscopic effect is slightly less dramatic than on the LG Optimus 3D. It?s just not as sharp, with less prominent depth. The difference is small and the HTC phone has a wider sweet spot: finding the ideal viewing position is easier. It might even be possible for two people to watch 3D content on the EVO 3D screen simultaneously ? unthinkable on the LG Optimus 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, even if a tad dampened, the 3D imaging is impressive. The downside is that it?s only enabled in the EVO 3D camera app and gallery. The Optimus 3D had a larger number of preinstalled apps optimized to use its 3D screen, which is quite important given the next-to-non-existent supply of third-party offerings at this stage.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It does 2D too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>That said, 2D performance is actually the more important aspect of the EVO 3D?s screen. True, it will be the stereoscopic part that will be drawing crowds, but users will be stuck in two dimensions 90% of the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good news is that the EVO 3D has a large and bright high-res screen. The bad news is the same could be said for most of its competitors. The qHD resolution and the ample 4.3? diagonal certainly give it an advantage, but its contrast is no match for the AMOLEDs or even the Reality and Retina displays out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing angles aren?t perfect either ? the EVO 3D does a lot better than the previous generation of HTC devices (Desire HD, Desire Z etc.), but it?s losing way more contrast when looked at an angle than an Incredible S, for example. It?s not bad enough to be a burden in everyday use. But it won?t produce the stunning effect of the icons appearing as if they?re painted on top of the screen that some of the competitors have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, most of those competitors aren?t doing 3D in their spare time and the only one that does is not doing that much better either. The LG Optimus 3D might have a bit better contrast and viewing angles, but the EVO 3D resolution advantage more than makes up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the HTC EVO 3D display test results so you can see how that one compares to its peers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Starting with the front-panel controls, the typical capacitive foursome includes Home, Menu, Back and Search keys ? without being too big, they?re well spaced to avoid mispresses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The home and search keys have the usual extra functionality upon a longer press: task switcher and voice search, respectively.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the EVO 3D?s display we find the earpiece, the ambient light sensor, the status LED and the video-call camera. The automatic screen brightness is optional and can be turned off. A proximity sensor takes care of disabling the display during calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left side of the smartphone is the microUSB port. Obviously, HTC felt placing a protective cap over it would?ve compromised its usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the EVO 3D is quite plain: there?s a mouthpiece and a slit to use when you need to release the back cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top we find the power/screen lock key and the 3.5mm audio jack, which too is exposed. However the metal rim that surrounds it is a nifty accent. There's also another microphone here, which enables stereo sound recording for those 720p videos that you are going to be making.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D?s right-hand side is where one of our favorite controls is placed. And that?s neither the long and thin volume rocker, nor the slider that toggles 2D and 3D mode (those are both decently ergonomic, too). No, it?s the massive super comfortable shutter key with excellent response and solid press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That button alone takes the usability of the EVO 3D camera to a new level ? it easily beats most of the smartphones we?ve seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we find the pair of 5 megapixel camera lenses at the back, with the dual-LED flash in between. The loudspeaker grill is here too, placed on the frame around all that photo equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the back cover is quite tricky actually, as it always gets stuck around the camera key so you need to move your fingernail up the side of the device until it opens enough for you not to worry that it will break.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the back cover you find the hot-swappable microSD card slot, the SIM compartment and the 1730 mAh Li-Ion battery that HTC claim should last for up to 420 hours of stand-by or up to 9 hours and 20 minutes of talk time. We managed to squeeze almost two days of moderate to heavy usage by disabling the auto-sync option. It is a pretty solid achievement we think. With auto-sync on and/or heavier use you get a day?s worth of battery ? par for the course for modern-day smartphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we move on to the software part of the review, we?d like to praise HTC for the excellent build quality of the EVO 3D. Last-gen HTC smartphones tended to exhibit minor issues with the finish and the way they were put together. None of those is to be seen here ? the EVO 3D is solid as a rock and looks fit to last in the long run. It?s quite the looker too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sense UI, Gingerbread and the new lockscreen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D comes with Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread and the latest version 3.0 of the HTC Sense UI. We've already seen it in action in the HTC Sensation. Check out the video demo we?ve prepared and watch out for the new lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense 3.0 lockscreen has four shortcuts and a ring at the bottom. You drag the ring towards the center of the screen to unlock the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, you can drag any of the shortcuts into the ring to unlock the phone and launch the corresponding app. You can assign any four apps to the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D comes with six different lockscreens preinstalled. You can access them in the Personalize menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default homescreen just shows the ring, four shortcuts and the time. Then there's the Photo album lockscreen, which tosses photos from your gallery in cool 3D fashion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the Friend Stream widget with SNS updates and the Weather widget which shows off the Sense UI's cool weather animations. There's Stocks too - with quotes flying up or down. Finally, there's the Clock lockscreen which shows a bigger clock - you can pick any of the 11 clock widgets available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, you can't download new lockscreens from the HTC Hub. Not yet anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is the Sense homescreen, with a scroll arc at the bottom that's just an indication of which homescreen pane you?re on ? it can't be used for actual scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s Leap view instead - tap the home key (on the center homescreen) or do a pinch gesture to zoom out to display the thumbnails of all seven homescreen panes at once. Upon a press and hold you can drag to reposition the homescreen panes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Seven homescreen panes is all you get though ? there?s no add or delete option. With all those widgets (which are quite useful too) you?ll want to keep all of them anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense comes with the proprietary HTC Scenes ? essentially six custom homescreen setups (Work, Travel, Social, etc). Each scene changes the wallpaper and the set of widgets. For instance, the Work scene has a Stocks widget, while the Social offers a Twitter widget. Those can be customized, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You select a Scene within a fancy-looking 3D card interface. You can modify existing scenes (older Sense versions prompted you to save modifications as a new scene) and you can get more scenes off the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between scenes takes a couple of seconds but the customization goes deep ? the business and personal modes that some competing phones offer seem quite limited compared to the HTC Scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Sense has another customization option called Skins. Every skin changes the look and feel of most of the onscreen buttons, application screens, option menus, and other items. Each comes with unique wallpaper and uses different colors for various UI elements. They can also replace the standard dock, lockscreen and widget frames with custom ones or change their shape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu displays as a typical grid, laid out on vertical pages with shortcuts sorted alphabetically. You can set different sorting options - alphabetically, most recent or oldest - but you can't rearrange them manually. There's a list layout, where two-finger alphabet scrolling is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu has a tabbed layout similar to different Sense elements (such as the phonebook). There are three tabs available at the bottom ? All apps, Frequent and Favorites. They are quite useful especially when you have lots of installed applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the Personalize button brings out a whole screen of items to choose from ? for the display (scenes, wallpapers and skin), for the homescreen (widgets, shortcuts, folders, etc.) and even sounds (ringtones, alarms, notifications and Sound set).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the widget section, both types of widgets (custom HTC and stock Android) are placed on the same page. There are so many of them you may find the seven homescreen panes short. You can download new widgets off the Market or the HTC Hub.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you select a widget you are prompted to choose between several versions ? most widgets have at least two styles. The different versions typically offer at least two sizes of the widget and different skins. For example, there are thirteen different clocks. Still they don't seem to have changed all that much since the HTC Desire.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some widget styles even offer different functionality. One version of the Twitter widget, for instance, shows updates for the people you follow and lets you tweet/update status. The other version is more compact and only allows status updates and tweets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing the homescreen is different to vanilla Android. You can tap and hold on a widget and you can drag across homescreen panes. While you're dragging a widget (or shortcut or whatever), two "buttons" appear at the bottom of the screen - Edit and Remove. You drop the widget on either button to perform the corresponding action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Edit can be used to modify the settings of a widget - e.g. choose a different folder for the Photo Frame album or even choose a different version of the Clock widget. This saves you the trouble of first deleting a widget and then putting it back on the screen to choose a different version, setting and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a list of recent apps (in addition to the notification list), just like a task switcher. A press and hold of the Home button works too. The notification area is tabbed as well - the second tab has toggles for WLAN, Bluetooth, GPS, network data or the Wi-Fi hotspot. There is a shortcut to the full list of settings and the last line shows used/free memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the standard task switcher, you get a task manager too. It's simple to use - each running app is listed with an indication of how much RAM it's using (no CPU usage reading though). You can terminate apps one by one and there's a Kill All button too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fast boot feature is enabled on the HTC EVO 3D but it won?t work if you have removed the battery ? in that case it will do a regular slow boot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool things is apps preserve their state after the restart ? so if you were browsing a web site before turning the phone off, the browser will restore your session.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our guess is, HTC is using some sort of Suspend or Hibernate routine as seen in regular computers to implement the fast boot; still great feature to have, though.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D has a 1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon chipset with Adreno 220 graphics to support its power-hungry interface and 3D features. In essence it should be on par with the likes of the Galaxy S II, Sensation and Optimus 2X ? in reality the scores tell a different story.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The higher-res screen puts it at a disadvantage as the GPU has to push out 35% more pixels than the competition. But more RAM gives the EVO 3D the upper hand over the Sensation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did go all out in testing the EVO 3D version we had for our head-to-head with the Sensation 4G, but this is a new unit we're reviewing and there are some differences. Let's get the technicalities out of the way before we go on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This EVO 3D is a retail unit running version 2.3.4 of Gingerbread; for comparison's sake the US version for Sprint that we reviewed recently had 2.3.3. Although the more recent software implies some further tweaks, in reality the GSM version of the EVO 3D did worse in the synthetic tests. Today however, we pit the EVO 3D against its main GSM rival - the Optimus 3D - and we?ve added some dual-core heavyweights for flavor - the Galaxy S II and the HTC Sensation - let's take a look at the numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant gauges the 3D performance aspects of the EVO 3D and it?s clearly at a disadvantage with its qHD resolution as opposed to the Optimus 3D and the Galaxy S II. It was outscored by the Sensation and by a large margin too, which is odd. The US CDMA flavor of the EVO 3D did a lot better here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack is based on a benchmark for supercomputers so it makes perfect use of all the cores it can get - the faster, the better too. We ran multi-thread tests. The EVO 3D managed to trounce only its in-house competition and lost to both the Optimus 3D (close) and the Galaxy S II (badly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BenchmarkPi is CPU-intensive but it's not designed for dual-cores so the older CPU architecture shows clearly. Here the EVO 3D was horrible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider is an in-browser benchmark and it shows the HTC EVO 3D trailing behind. Now, HTC has put a custom Flash player (as they usually do) in the browser but that can't be it - SunSpider is pure JavaScript. Anyway, that?s not our only grudge with the web browser on the EVO 3D, but more on that later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vellamo is a web-browsing benchmark. It tests stability, page load and reload speeds, smoothness, JavaScript engine performance and also graphics and rendering. The EVO 3D came out on par with the Optimus 3D (2 points could?ve gone either way) and it performed well but the Galaxy S II is clearly the victor here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic benchmarks are for number-crunchers and don't always tell the whole story. The EVO 3D is a solid smartphone and it behaves like one. No need to fear frustrating lags and freezing. Differences in performance are inevitable but there's nothing major to worry about.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sense phonebook is top-notch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Social network integration goes deep in the EVO 3D's phonebook. It manages to keep things neatly in order, even though it?s juggling everything from SMS to Facebook photo albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The entire People app (the phonebook) is tabbed and with more tabs than the stock Android. You have all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That?s just the first tab ? the other tabs hold further details, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the text messages between you and the given contact in a conversation layout. The third tab is a list of emails you've exchanged with the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next two tabs really turn the EVO 3D into a powerful networking tool. The first holds Facebook contact updates, and the other called "Albums" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab shows the call history for the contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you?re switching from another phone don?t worry ? you don?t even need a computer to pull your contacts, messages and calendar items from the old phone into your new HTC. The Transfer app supports many phones from major manufacturers and moves the data over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s an old trick (Symbian-powered Nokias have been doing this for ever) and most people would probably go with syncing the contacts over the cloud, but still it?s a handy tool to have.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Smart telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The on-screen dialer features a keypad, a shortcut to the call log and a list of contacts beneath (you can hide the keypad). The HTC EVO 3D has both Smart Dialing and Voice dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone held on to signal just fine and we had no Sensation-like issues with the EVO 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EVO 3D makes good use of the accelerometer during calls ? turning the phone over will mute the ringer of an incoming call, while placing it down, starts the loudspeaker automatically when you are in the middle of a call. The other feature is Quiet ring on pickup ? once you move the phone, the ringer will quiet down (but not cancel the call).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is pocket mode ? the ringer volume will increase if the phone is in your pocket (the proximity sensor takes care of detecting that).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's how the HTC EVO 3D fares in our traditional loudspeaker performance test. It scored an average mark placing it right alongside the Sensation. It?s not a quiet phone per se, but you?d have to choose a loud ringtone just to be safe.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>All round messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC EVO 3D are capable of handling all sorts of messaging ? SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is backed-up by several apps and widgets, and there?s Gtalk, which can connect you to Google?s chat network and compatible networks too (like Ovi Chat).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area will display a line of an incoming SMS or just the number of messages if there?s more than one. You can set the status LED to alert of unread messages too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Text and multimedia messages are displayed in threads ? you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact?s photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message. Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The whole thing looks almost the same as a chat client. When viewing a thread, the most recent message is placed at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered ? the phone will find the contact you want even if you misspell it (e.g. ?drx? matches Dexter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compose text box is bigger and covers nearly half of the screen in landscape mode. A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gingerbread text selection is very user friendly. Upon a press and hold, a ?magnifying glass? appears, enabling accurate cursor movements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A custom-made virtual QWERTY keyboard is the only means of text input on the EVO 3D. While it?s not as good as a hardware one, it does the job. the 4.3? screen has enough real estate for big, well-spaced keys, which are easy to hit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Premium email experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D comes with two email apps ? the traditional Gmail app and the generic HTC Mail app, which brings all your email accounts together into a single inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail app has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple (Gmail) accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard HTC Mail app features several tabs that let you filter the inbox: you can opt to display conversations, emails with attachments only, unread mail only or invitations. You can mark emails too ? they will show up in the marked mail tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The conversation view tries to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC email app can handle several accounts and not just from Gmail. When you add multiple accounts, you can view each inbox individually or go into the All accounts section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each account is color coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything the HTC EVO 3D lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery goes 3D<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery on the EVO 3D is one of the places where 3D content is displayed ? it?s the stereoscopic images you?ve taken with the device. What we missed was a dedicated 3D media app like the 3D Space on LG?s Optimus 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC gallery has changed - it now stacks photos like the vanilla Android gallery does (it used to display a list of thumbnails). The Albums app automatically locates images and videos, no matter where they are stored. Images taken in 3D have a small 3D tag to be easily identified.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images and videos stored in different folders appear in different sub-galleries that automatically get the name of the folder ? which is an effective file management solution. You can also select which folders the gallery should display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ones you pick one of the "stacks" (each representing a folder), you're presented with a grid of the photos inside. There is also a camera shortcut, but it?s only available once you start browsing any of the sub-folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sharing a photo on the HTC EVO 3D is very straightforward ? tap the share button and pick your preferred sharing method. There?s everything from sharing via Bluetooth or email, to posting on Facebook, Twitter or photo sharing sites like Picasa and Flickr. You can also upload videos straight to YouTube. You could use DLNA to push photos to your compatible TV too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also mass delete images, but still no mass copy-and-paste options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can?t copy/paste images from folder to folder either ? you?d need a proper file manager for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC EVO 3D supports multi-touch and you can take full advantage of it while browsing your images. You can zoom to 100% with a simple double tap on the screen. The implementation here is extra smooth too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D imaging is not everyone?s cup of tea ? it?s uncomfortable to some, especially on such a small screen. If you zoom in on a 3D photo it will automatically switch to 2D mode. There?s not much point though as those images are 2 MP only and their quality is poor.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player has DivX/XviD and 3D<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The other place you can enjoy 3D content is the video player. You can play the videos you?ve taken and watch stereoscopic movies in DivX and XviD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video files can be accessed in the All videos subfolder in the Gallery or from the Videos shortcut in the menu, they launch the same thing. There's no dedicated video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video files are displayed as a grid and can be shared over MMS, email, or YouTube, Facebook and Flickr, even apps like Dropbox if you have them installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video playing interface on the HTC EVO 3D offers a full screen switch (stretch / crop video to fit the screen) and you can scrub through videos. SRS sound enhancement is also available but there?s no subtitle support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player does OK in general but our unit would only go as high as 720p resolution. It didn?t play 1080p FullHD videos and we did try all kinds of formats. Hopefully this is a unit-specific glitch. The player handled all the 720p DivX and XviD videos hassle free. 720p is a good enough to watch movies, especially on a portable screen but 1080p capability is a mandatory performance benchmark in this price range. There's no MKV or subtitle support however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>DLNA connectivity comes in handy ? the EVO 3D can stream the videos wirelessly to your TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the MHL port too - if you have the proper adapter, you can hook up your HDTV using an HDMI cable. The EVO 3D needs some work in this department though, if we're to accept it as a proper portable HD video player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player makes Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the EVO 3D, too, is part of the new Sense UI. It?s the same as what we saw in the HTC Sensation, and looks and handles nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard music library view is the Artists section, but you can easily switch to one of the other six tabs beneath, which are for Albums, All Songs, Playlists, Genres, Composers and Purchased (at least our unit had, which featured a Vodafone music shop).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A dropdown at the top of the screen lets you switch between your library on the phone and DLNA media servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The now playing interface is a Cover-Flow-like visualization of the current playlist ? you can swipe sideways to skip songs back or forward. You can opt to view the full playlist if you need to skip more than a few tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EVO 3D offers SRS sound enhancement to boost the listening experience. If you plug in a set of headphones, you can change equalizer settings too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two shortcuts in the top corners act as toggles for shuffle and repeat. Other goodies include looking up a song on YouTube or updating the album art for the current or all songs. You can enable auto update too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping the bar at the top of the screen that says "HTC EVO 3D" lets you play the song on another device wirelessly - either over DLNA or Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Player lockscreen has a neat feature: a 3D record cover with album art, track info and music controls (play/pause and skip). You can flip it around and it's backside will display album art and track info too, but no music controls. Not much use in it, but good eye candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s a music recognition app preloaded on the EVO 3D ? SoundHound. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D is also equipped with an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing that annoyed us about the radio is that it takes quite a while to start and stop ? about five seconds. Maybe it has something to do with preloading RDS information about the stations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output could be a bit better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D has decently high (though certainly not spectacular) volume levels. Its audio output is decent, but we have certainly seen better at this price point. Even HTC's very own Sensation does a bit better than its stereoscopic sibling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The average stereo crosstalk aside, the EVO 3D does pretty well when used with an external amplifier (like a car audio or home stereo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When headphones come into play, though, there's notable degradation in just about every aspect of the EVO 3D performance. The signal-to-noise ratio decreases, the dynamic range falls and distortion starts to creep in. Stereo crosstalk also increases, but not as much as with other handsets, so it's actually better than average in that case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dual 5MP cameras and a massive shutter key<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D has not one, but two 5MP snappers on its back that are capable of capturing 2D photos in full 2560&#x445;1920 resolution and stereoscopic 3D images at up to 2MP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very space efficient and looks unchanged since the Sensation. Most of the controls are on the right side of the viewfinder. The EVO 3D does offer a hardware shutter key which is probably the best we've seen - it's a huge button with very solid and distinct half-press. There?s a slider to toggle 2D and 3D mode. By default the viewfinder image is cropped so that it fills the entire screen, but you can switch that off (note that cropping reduces the resolution).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D has face detection and geotagging. Touch focus is enabled too, but you?ll hardly need it with the wonderful shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a panel on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on). There are other image effects too. For example, Warp places a control point on the screen, which you can drag with your finger for various face-warp effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Depth of field is another such effect ? it adds a radius slider besides the control point and will blur everything in the photo that falls outside the circle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC is not the go-to manufacturer to get a great cameraphone these days and the HTC EVO 3D makes no exception to the rule. Even though its pivotal feature is the 3D image and video capture (and glasses-free playback, of course), in 2D mode, it's not something to write home about. The EVO 3D photos exhibit some traditional flaws of HTC products such as corner softness, heavy noise reduction and oversharpening.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors in daylight photos tend to be slightly off but a lot of it is attributed to the pink spot in the center (which is most visible on the white resolution test charts).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the EVO 3D shoots 3D images in only 2 megapixels (the Optimus 3D manages to take 3 MP ones) and the image quality is not that good. The photos look okay only on the 4.3-incher of the EVO 3D - viewing them on a PC takes the excitement of the 3D label right out of you. We saw a similar case with the US version as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've got a bunch of samples below. Here is the set of 2D photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are the 3D samples. You should use the Wiggle view mode (available as a switch at the bottom of our pop-up viewer) to get a basic idea of the 3D effect without the need for glasses or a 3D screen. If you happen to have any of the supported anaglyph glasses at hand, you might want to go for the Anaglyph view mode too. Interlaced 3D screens are also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro shots turn out fine but only in 2D mode, in stereoscopic mode close-ups are a no-go as the two cameras are too far apart to lock proper focus. The resulting pictures are just painful to look at. We'll spare you the result and we'll only show you 2D macro samples.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D enters our Photo Compare Tool to join the other 5MP shooters. The tool?s page will give you enough info on how to use it and what to look for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EVO 3D clearly suffers form a center pink spot that spans across a large part of the photo but generally the levels of resolved detail and the digital noise are on par with the Optimus 3D.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Bad HD-only video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D captures videos up to 720p resolution in 2D and 3D. The lack of 1080p video capture is odd considering the dual-core processor ticking inside. 720p resolution is more than adequate but it just seems like FullHD is something of a must for high-end droids these days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder is similar to the still camera?s and there are lots of customizable options with this one. You can set the video resolution, recording limit and add effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Autofocus works here too, but only before you start shooting ? then the focus is locked and won?t change even if you get closer or move back. Still, the EVO 3D had no problems focusing at even very close distances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot in .MP4, which is a step up from the .3GP format of the Sensation. Like the Sensation, the EVO 3D's camera boasts stereo audio recording at 44kHz, which is a huge improvement over the sub-22kHz mono sound that, say, the LG Optimus 3D or Samsung Galaxy S II record.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EVO 3D produces generally smooth videos and though the video quality is not the best around, their quality is ok.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go two untouched video samples from the EVO 3D?s camcorder. We?ve prepared a 2D 720p video and a 3D one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here?s a video uploaded to YouTube for convenience. To view them properly we suggest hitting the full-screen button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is the 3D video sample. You will need glasses to view it properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We entered the HTC EVO 3D in our Video Compare Tool database too and put it head to head with other 720p mobile camcorders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EVO 3D tends to be pretty harsh on the noise but the oversharpened subjects with pumped up colors look nice.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unlimited connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D boasts a complete set of connectivity options. There?s quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and blazing fast dual-band 3G (or tri-band 3G, depending on region). The speeds go up to 14.4Mbps downlink and 5.76Mbps uplink.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi b/g/n complete with Wi-Fi hotspot functionality. Bluetooth 3.0 with A2DP (but not High Speed).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Full DLNA support is enabled via the Connected media app. It handles all sorts of DLNA connections ? playing media to and from devices on the network with just a couple of clicks. Apps like the gallery have this functionality built in too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested the EVO 3D for death grip issues and got worried when the Wi-Fi indicator fell to zero when we held the top. It would still open web pages easily, so it seems that the issue is with the finicky signal strength indicator and not the actual radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have a long list of options for connecting to a PC - Charge only, Disk drive (mass storage), HTC Sync, USB tethering (use as a modem) and Internet pass-through (the phone uses a computer's Internet connection). The Charge only and Disk Drive now have big, thumbable icons, which is great since they are used most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, is the HTC Portable Hotspot. It can support up to 8 devices (the default Froyo app maxes out at 5). The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable ?allowed users? only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).You can also hide the SSID for improved security and select the Wi-Fi channel manually for improved performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We haven't covered all the connectivity yet - the "microUSB port" as we called it for convenience is actually an MHL port. If you plug a MHL dongle in it, you can output HD video over a standard HDMI connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone's UI is mirrored on the TV - the qHD resolution has the perfect 16:9 aspect ratio for connecting to HDTVs.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Browser plays FullHD Flash videos, crashes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D has the latest Android 2.3 Gingerbread web browser, plenty of processing power and a large, high-res screen - in other words, all the right ingredients.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface keeps mostly out of sight, which leaves the entire screen to the web page. The minimalist UI is still quite powerful ? hit the menu key and six keys pop up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are back and forward buttons, adding and viewing bookmarks and managing the open tabs. Finally, the More button brings out even more options ? stuff like Find on page and text selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The EVO 3D's browser also supports double tap zooming and text reflow, which makes even longer texts extremely easy to read on the phone display. Pinch-zooming is available too - and if you zoom out too far, the tab selection UI pops up, which is very convenient.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of tabs, they are displayed as 3D cards and you can easily open multiple tabs (a tap and hold on a link lets you open it in a new tab). The bookmark list shows a thumbnail view of the bookmarked pages and you get a ?most visited? list in addition to the regular history.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, launch the Quick lookup app (which offers Google Translate among other things) or share the text via a message or social networking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 1080p YouTube video playing smoothly was a nice surprise after the video player frowned at 1080p clips. For comparison, FullHD Flash videos were choppy back on the Sensation. Flash games work fine on the EVO 3D too. You can play the Flash content in full screen and landscape mode, which makes the most out of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could use the YouTube app if you find navigating YouTube in the browser hard. Mind you, the Android 2.3 browser has support for HTML5 and its video tag but that is a few years (at best) away from becoming the norm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser however crashed on a number of occasions, each time it was on a Flash-based site - YouTube and a site for mobile Flash games, for example. The improved performance of the Flash player is great but needs a stability tweak.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Well-stocked organizer complete with a document editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The usual set of organizer apps is aboard the HTC EVO 3D, with a mobile Office app to boot that can both view and edit documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Polaris app has support for viewing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, including the Office 2007 versions and it can create Office 2003 Word and Excel documents but not 2007 docs. Oddly, you can edit existing Office 2007 docs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a PDF viewer to handle PDF files. The on-screen keyboard does cut down the available space to about two thirds but if you zoom out you can still fit a reasonable amount of text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This version of Polaris gives less editing options than we're used to - you can do copy, cut and paste, then apply bold, italic and underline styles and highlight text and that's it. There used to be font style options here but now they're inexplicably gone. You can't edit formulas in Excel spreadsheets either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching saved files (and we mean all kind of files) is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has five different types of view: daily, weekly, monthly, agenda and invitation. Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invitation only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view showing the weather forecast at the top of the screen is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator aboard. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D features an alarm clock application, which can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The Desk clock app displays the current time and date and lets you switch off the display backlighting to save battery power or not disturb at night.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stopwatch and timer are part of the Clock app and might come in handy if you plan to take the phone with you when doing sports. The World clock is here too - it lets you quickly check the time in different time zones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stocks application gives you quotes from Yahoo finance. You can use the Stocks lockscreen too. The Voice recorder might be quite useful for making audio notes and the weather app brings Yahoo?s weather forecast for your area a click away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s an HTC-branded flashlight app too ? it uses the LED flash and you can set it to 3 levels of intensity. Nice and all, but the Android Market is full of this kind of apps already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick lookup is another handy app. It lets you enter a query and view the Wikipedia article (formatted for easy reading), search Google, YouTube, use Google Translate or look it up in Google Dictionary.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Facebook and Twitter on board<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Facebook and Twitter fans will appreciate the preinstalled Facebook and Peep apps, which let you post on the world?s largest social networks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest Facebook app is available, which enables things like Facebook Chat (yet another way to talk to your friends) and Facebook Places (which lets you to check into the likes of Foursquare).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You'd do well to install Facebook Messenger, which is one of the best ways to chat with your friends, but doesn?t come preinstalled on the EVO 3D.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app for Android does come preinstalled ? some might prefer it over Peep (they both integrate with the phonebook so you don?t have to actually start the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The official Twitter app is the latest version too ? tweets can be geotagged, uploaded automatically to yfrog or TwitPic and you can snap a photo to include in the tweet straight in the app. There are handy buttons to reply to or retweet a message.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Android Market, HTC Hub and HTC Likes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.), so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option to display all apps in bulk, but you?ll probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are all kinds of apps in the Android market and the most important categories are well covered (file managers, navigation apps, document readers etc.). The EVO 3D has a powerful chipset and a high-res screen, so you shouldn?t run into any compatibility problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes is an alternative way to browse the Market, which might prove to be more convenient than the vanilla app. It has tabs for Featured and Popular apps, which are presented as 3D cards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To make finding apps even easier, you can see what apps/games your friends have commented on, which is a great way to find recommended apps. Or you can use the HTCSense.com site to look for apps from the comfort of your computer and mark them. Later, you can find them in the Market items tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Likes pulls apps from the Android Market. You can comment on apps, like and share them via texts or email, even over Twitter, Dropbox and Bluetooth (which just sends a text note with a link to the app).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not quite an app store, but the HTC Hub is a good source of widgets, wallpapers, scenes and skins and also sound customizations ? ringtones, alarms and notification sounds and entire sound sets (a set is a whole package that brings together the other three categories).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTCSense.com integration<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTCSense.com offers some premium features for free (a bit like HTC Locations). The Phone locator can be used to locate your phone if it?s stolen and you can lock it or even erase all the data from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And don?t worry ? HTCSense.com will back up your EVO 3D contacts and messages (though contacts should already be safe and sound in the Google cloud).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other handy features include ring phone (helps locate it if you?ve misplaced it), toggles for call and message forwarding. The site also lets you view and edit contacts and view messages. You can compose text and multimedia messages too ? so you can use the big computer keyboard and you don?t even have to have the EVO 3D in front of you to send a couple of messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also view your and your friends? Footprints. Finally, the HTC Hub lets you browse apps and games on the computer and mark them, which makes them easier to find on the phone later (in HTC Likes). You can?t initiate an app download from the site though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The site is a bit heavy but if you?re using an updated browser you should be fine. It used to have problems in IE9, but now everything works fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two-way navigation: Google and HTC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute (from a cold start and A-GPS switched off). If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we?ve covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest version uses vector maps, which are very data efficient and easy to cache. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D also comes with HTC Places, an app developed in cooperation with TomTom (provider of the software) and Route66 (providing the maps).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With HTC Locations you can download country maps for free, or just cache maps as you browse (the size of the cache is adjustable). Google Maps has caching enabled too, but the best part about Locations is that it can calculate new routes even when offline ? and Gmaps can?t (it can only reroute you, not calculate a new route).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It doesn?t do voice-guided navigation for free like Nokia Maps though ? but still, you can use the list of instructions and tap the next and pervious arrows to see the next turn. Not ideal but it?s a great addition, especially since it?s free. You can always pay for a voice-guided navigation license too - it's cheaper than buying a dedicated GPS unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Locations has a regular 2D view and a 3D view, which is convenient because it gives you a better idea of what?s ahead. It?s just as easy to work with as Google Maps and has POI too (including your Footprints) and also 3D buildings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pinch zoom works in both 2D and 3D modes and you can turn on compass mode ? at first it seems choppy, but that?s only to avoid wobbling (digital compasses are not the most accurate things in the world). You could use two fingers to rotate the camera manually too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D is a hard phone to review. It so wants to be the best at everything it does that it?s bound to end up with quite a mixed scorecard. The problem with this one is that establishing its worth to users is impossible without knowing their priorities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D does provide an incredibly solid smartphone experience. But if that?s what you are after, there are a few handsets that will match its performance without charging a premium for a single feature of questionable merit. Sense UI fans will find what they are looking for, but a few other members of the HTC lineup will gladly offer them the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What if 3D is a must-have? Perhaps the high-res screen? Well there seems to always be an alternative. It's hard to be at the top without making a few enemies. Here they go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For the better stereoscopic experience, we?d pick the LG Optimus 3D. It has a screen with a slightly more dramatic 3D effect and more relevant content preinstalled, while the OMAP4 chipset will give you all the oomph you need from a modern-day smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus 3D</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are having second thoughts about 3D screens you?d probably be better off with a device like the Samsung Galaxy S II. The Exynos must be the most potent chipset currently available, while the Super AMOLED Plus screen is really hard to beat in terms of image quality. You also get 8MP stills and Full HD video in a super slim package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy S II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The massive high res screen of the metal-clad HTC Sensation, the Motorla Atrix' qHD display and docking options and the lower price of the LG Optimus 2X are also threaten to put the HTC EVO 3D in question. The smartphone experience is similar across the sample and the ?extra? features are worth a thought.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   HTC Sensation ? Motorola Atrix ? LG Optimus 2X</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, despite all the advantages of those smartphones over the EVO 3D, none of them is a complete replacement. The key feature of the HTC flagship is that it actually has more key features than anyone else. It?s the only way to get a 3D screen and qHD resolution at the same time. Or Sense UI and a gig of RAM. We could go on really, but we guess the point's been made.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC EVO 3D is a device that strives to do it all and we are pleased to report that for the most part it delivers. However, competition is so intense today that it would be impossible to beat everyone at every level. The EVO 3D gets points for trying. Winners don't pick their battles, you'd just be wise to pick your priorities.</paragraph>
