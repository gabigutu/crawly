			<paragraph>Amid talk of Android and would-be heroes we're about to revisit HTC on their hallowed PocketPC ground. Good things seem to come in pairs for the company while out-and-out upgrades are always good news for the user. With two jewels in the crown and two pros on the squad, HTC march towards PocketPC dominance and the Touch Pro2 looks like it has what it takes to lead the campaign.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More powerful gear and more impressive shell than the original Pro, HTC Touch Pro2 is in charge of the armored unit, while the Diamond2 tackles the infantry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>PocketPC is definitely the HTC game but it sure isn't a one horse race. The list of prominent number 2's is perhaps about to be continued with an XPERIA. On the other hand, the launch of the Touch Pro2 is perhaps timed just right to beat another major headliner from the Symbian camp - the Nokia N97.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, that's just the background. The real thing is how the Touch Pro2 handles and performs. A number two can't be much of prophet we guess but a well-done upgrade can bring in enough profit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Talking upgrade, the HTC Touch Pro2 takes a leap forward in screen terms pumping up both resolution and size. It inherits the original Touch Pro but stands on the shoulders of a TytN too. The return of the tilting screen will sure be cheered. Now, add the revamped and improved exterior and you've got upgraders by the balls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Oh, and that TouchFLO UI facelift we got a glimpse of on the new Diamond2 is just begging for another shot. So, the upgrade kit is all there but justifying the extra dime is the real deal and that's exactly what we are about to check.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hailed the new Diamond and as long as the new Pro follows suit it sure has nothing to fear. But it'd better be keen on action and fit to play along, cause we're not letting it go unchallenged. Unboxing starts right after the jump.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Box contents are borderline passable<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 retail package may not have the spectacular shape of its predecessor's but contents are pretty much the same. This time HTC went for a classic shape and fairly large size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having previewed a bunch of other HTC handsets, we knew better than hope for a memory card inside. To put it mildly, HTC are letting everyone decide how big a card they need. As for accessories, HTC have launched quite a line of nice little extras for the Touch Pro2 to be purchased additionally, as was the case with the first Touch Pro.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The items that ship with the Touch Pro2 are the familiar charger/USB cable combo, a set of wired headphones, a spare stylus and a CD with software of arguable use. Our favorite bit sure is the the leather carrying case for the Touch Pro2. There is also a bunch of leaflets and guides, along with a catalog of available accessories to order.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Touch Pro2 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The formidable bulk of HTC Touch Pro2 stretches out to 116 x 59.2 x 17.3 mm with a total weight of 178.5 g. Now, we thought the original HTC Touch Pro was a handful but the Pro2 is on the verge of getting out of hand and back to TyTN II excess. The handset is definitely not a piece to just slip in a pocket and forget about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to weight - we are not saying it is entirely a bad thing as heavier phones tend to have this solid and reliable feel that we really like. Yet, 180 grams is probably too much, too dangerously close to the old-time heft of the TyTN II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now the HTC Touch Pro2 is definitely one hell of a looker when closed and just lying around. Shiny frame and big bright display, it sure will attract attention. Some of this positive impression will fade away once you hold it and the almost UMPC dimensions start to hit in. Still, the designers certainly deserve a pat on the back for the ergonomics of this heavy bloke.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Pro2 isn't quite as inspiring but we still like it better than the original Touch Pro. The immense faux loudspeaker grill seems to be the thing that bothers us here, plus the plastic seems prone to scratches. However, all comparison to the original is quite in favor of the Pro2. For one, the paint at the back of the original Touch Pro was peeling off ridiculously fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front panel of HTC Touch Pro2 is almost completely taken by the huge 3.6" WVGA touchscreen display. The pixel count and good brightness levels add up to excellent picture quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just as any other WinMo handset, the HTC Touch Pro2 is able to show up to 65K colors on its display. We'll just say it yet again this isn't that much of a disadvantage compared to 16M-color displays. There are of course cases where this may potentially result in color banding in color gradients but that's hardly a frequently reported issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However the problem of sunlight legibility still stands. The HTC Touch Pro2 by far isn't the best device to have with you in the bright sun. We have to admit we do notice a slight improvement but it is far from enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, the responsiveness of the display is just excellent. Even if it's a resistive unit, the Touch Pro2 touchscreen only needs a very gentle tap to register a command. We do realize that this may be partially attributed to the increased processing power or the optimization of the UI but it doesn't really matter as long as it works.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, one of the coolest features of the Touch Pro2 display is that, unlike the original Touch Pro, it tilts to provide a better viewing angle when working with handset. It was a feature that was appreciated on the TyTN II and its absence on the HTC Touch Pro was curious.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the HTC engineers wanted to increase the screen estate but still keep the handset within reasonable size, they had to take the four very large buttons of the Touch Pro and squeeze them at the bottom of the front panel, right on the edge. The touch-sensitive scroll wheel / regular D-pad combo was also dropped and replaced with the touch-sensitive zoom bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The zoom bar has basically the same functionality as the touch-sensitive overlay of the original Pro's scroll wheell. It can be used on images, web pages, messages, and doubles as a music control. We are delighted with the performance of the zoom bar, which responds immediately on almost every occasion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the other end of the front panel, right above the display we find the earpiece, the ambient light sensor and the secondary video-call camera along with the status LED.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The left side of the HTC Touch Pro2 features nothing but the volume rocker. No issues to report here, this straightforward control is hardly worth too much discussion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom features the miniUSB port for connecting the data cable, charger and the headphones. The other thing to note here is the stylus compartment, which isn't magnetic this time. We are not quite happy with the way the color of the stylus handle is different from the surrounding surface. Without giving that much of a boost to usability, it looks like a designer's oversight. Anyway, it isn't big enough to spoil the overall impression the phone makes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stylus of the Pro2 is active, meaning that it will wake the phone up automatically when pulled out. And if you do so during a call it will launch the Notes applications, so you can quickly put down a phone number for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the top of the Pro2, typical of HTC WinMo devices, there is only the power key, which is also used for toggling the standby mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card slot is on the right side of HTC Touch Pro2 and is of course hot-swappable. Unfortunately, you will have to remove the battery cover (and that is quite a task on this one, mind you) every time you access the slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 rear features the stereo speakers and the 3 megapixel camera lens. While the whole gray mesh looks like a loudspeaker grill the actual area used are two small apertures on either side of the camera lens. The rest is just fancy (or not) design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera doesn't have a flash to boost its low-light performance so don't expect miracles from it (nor should you in daylight either actually). We will get back to that in greater detail later in the review though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the Touch Pro2 also features the second microphone that is used for cancelling unwanted noise during calls. There is also a small mute button to use in speakerphone mode when you want to turn it's the mic off for a sec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the battery cover is the 1500 mAh Li-Ion battery that powers the HTC Touch Pro2. It should last up to 500 hours of stand-by or 8 hours and 30 minutes of talk time in 2G networks and up to 750 hours of stand-by or 6 hours and 30 minutes of talk time in 3G network. Those numbers are pretty impressive and imply great power management on a device with a screen that huge and also many power-hungry features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other element of interest under the back panel is the reset key. The small red button can only be pressed with the stylus or a similar pointed object.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sliding the HTC Touch Pro2 open reveals one of its key features - the five-row full QWERTY keyboard. We have to admit the slider action is a bit too rigid for our taste. It isn't something you cannot get used to though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon opening the keypad, the screen automatically rotates to landscape orientation. And then the fun starts. The keyboard is brilliant, with great ergonomics although the press feedback takes a bit of getting used to. Once you are past that though you will be speeding your way through endless texts just like that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The five-row layout is of great help here and the keys are still big enough to handle comfortably. The press is solid and touch orientation is quite good so, in general, there is little reason to complain about the QWERTY keyboard. The added spacing between the keys, thanks to the larger overall size of the device is also more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would have preferred the Space bar to be double the length but nothing is perfect you know.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the HTC Touch Pro2 seems superior to the original Pro. However, that doesn't necessarily mean outstanding. It's just that its predecessor turned out to be pretty fragile in the long term. We certainly hope that the new materials and paint will turn out more durable than that.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A better TouchFLO<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you are fan of Windows Mobile devices, you'll certainly be familiar with the HTC?s TouchFLO interface. There are some slightly different implementations of it in all current HTC WinMo smartphones, but in essence it?s the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new upgraded TouchFLO, which we already saw in the HTC Touch Diamond2 is not almost, but exactly the same as in the new Touch Pro2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new TouchFLO is so touch-optimized that even the slightest presses are detected and respond appropriately. Of course, when you eventually hit the underlying Windows Mobile, you?ll meet the same distinctly touch-unfriendly interface. Only this time, you?ll have to dig deeper than with the previous generation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchFLO 3D Home screen, as usual, offers a choice of full screen tabs, decked out with some impressive graphics. You can move through the tabs with a single finger sweep, or by scrolling the tab thumbnails at the bottom of the screen until you hit the one you need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s the familiar list from the last generation devices but with a few new twists. The available tabs include the home screen itself (with a large clock), favorite contacts, text messages, email, Internet, calendar, stock, photos and video, music, weather, and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a short video demo of the TouchFLO 3D that we took:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Count them one by one<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now, let's have a closer look at those tabs. A nice thing is that each tab comes with its own set of context keys, but the downside is that those are not customizable to suit your needs. With that TouchFLO 3D homescreen at hand, you?d rarely have to resort to using the underlying Windows (unless you are a hardcore fan that is).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than showing the clock, the Home tab gives you access to the HTC Call log, the revamped calendar, world clock and alarm. The context keys give you access to the dialpad and the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Later on in the review, we?ll take a look at the call log and the new calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second TouchFLO tab is called People and it?s also an old one. Here you can set favorite contacts with an assigned image or, in the absence of that, a generic one provided by the software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages tab shows your latest SMS/MMS, and a single finger sweep will take you to your next message. A small shortcut in the top right corner will automatically start a new SMS/MMS with the default Windows message editor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email tab shows your emails as a rather pleasing letter poking out of an envelope and, again, you can flip through them one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet tab launches the Opera 9.5 web browser or the slick preinstalled YouTube video client. You can also scroll your bookmarks and launch a webpage directly from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Similarly, there's no option for changing the default Opera browser. In the previous Pro we complained that there was no way to type a URL directly on the Home screen and open it in the browser. It seems that HTC took some of that on board and have put in a quick search bar which opens Google when you type something.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is definitely some progress, but it would have been much nicer to have a quick address bar. We hoped in Pro2 there will be address bar, but unfortunately our hopes move again to the next HTC device.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A better TouchFLO (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The next tab is the new completely updated calendar. It?s nicely touch-optimized and packed with new functionality. You can change the month by sweeping your finger up or down, while selecting a particular day will open the appointment view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If your choice is a day from the next five upcoming days then you?ll also get the weather forecast for it (of course that?s available only if you set and updated the weather in the Weather tab).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Stock tab is a well known tab from the HTC Touch HD and Touch Diamond2. It allows you to add stocks and track their changes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos and Video tab is the same as before. It gives you access to your images and video files, which you can scroll with finger sweeps. Two additional shortcuts allow you to start the camera or camcorder directly from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music tab has no changes too. It displays albums with their covers and you can flip through them much like you would on the iPhone with its famous Cover Flow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather tab continue to amaze with its beautiful graphics. You can check the weather in up to 7 locations and you can flip through them with a finger sweep. You can also get a 5-day forecast for these locations via the first context key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is Settings and it lets you control various system options and replaces the old and confusing Windows Mobile Settings page. New additions from Diamond2 are also here ? customizing tabs, contact card, mail setup and finally, accelerometer options and calibration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two context buttons give you further settings - that is to say those innumerable confusing WinMo options - and the Advanced page lets you select wireless or Bluetooth devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all, the Settings tab allows you to set the ringing profile, volume level and ringtone all from one central place, which is really handy. Even pressing the volume rocker brings up a fancy custom-made fullscreen slider instead of the usual WinMo mini-sliders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the customizing tab option you can re-order and, if necessary, hide some of the Home screen tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also have access to the HTC custom Communications manager, which handles all on-board transceivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have replaced the System status screen too. When you touch the icons on the top of the Home screen, you?ll bring up the notifications area where you can check missed events, operator messages, etc. This idea is most probably borrowed from the Android notifications, which do the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Communications manager for quick toggling of connectivity options is no longer accessible by touching those icons.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The new Start menu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The first time we pressed the Start button on the Diamond2, we thought we?d done something wrong because it opened something similar to the old customizable application launcher. This time we were prepared and knew that instead of the old not particularly user-friendly menu you now get the slightly upgraded app launcher with more icons, some of which are configured by default.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Windows Mobile 6.1 is still there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Once you get past the Home screen with all the fancy finger sweeps and animations, you are still left with the rather clunky and touch-unfriendly Microsoft OS. We are not against Windows Mobile by any means; however, having to poke around your device with a little stylus is so 1990s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC, however, have made some efforts to tweak the core Windows usability too. Some of the most commonly used system settings, contacts management, and the messaging department have all benefited, likewise image and web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC may have left in some of the old WinMo layout, but they did at least do something about the context menus. They are completely redesigned and you?ll never have to meet the old ones. They are now with bigger sections and fonts, rounded edges, pretty backgrounds and most important ? touch-optimized.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A gold medal for the contact manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is usually considered one of the strongest points of Windows Mobile. You have unlimited contacts list, unlimited info fields for each contact and brilliant synchronization options. Shame it was so damn ugly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that?s no more. Since the Diamond2 HTC have added a new interface which uses a small thumb icon for a person?s picture, set against a gray background with nice font. You can pick a letter of the alphabet by using the letter column placed on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching by gradual typing is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard editing is OK, but unfortunately the advanced editing of a contact throws you back into the old WinMo skin. But hey, you still have a plethora of available info fields - and if by any rare chance, those are not enough, you can always rename some of the existing ones and use them instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact is a whole new experience. HTC have done a great job again redesigning the whole interface into something quite stylish and visually attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are some functional changes too. The contact?s information is divided into groups ? names, communication and information. There are four different icons at the bottom ? the current info, all SMS with this contact, all emails and call history.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Another excellent telephony chapter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls is always a priority for any cell phone - that still holds true for smartphones such as the HTC Touch Pro2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone application offers Smart dialing, so you hardly ever need to go to the Contacts list in order to dial a number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in accelerometer gives the HTC Touch Pro2 a familiar cool feature: you can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down on the table. If you turn the handset back up, the ringing won't resume by itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don?t worry, it's unlikely your calls will get muted accidentally in your pocket - the feature is set up in such a way that it's more likely to not engage at all rather than engage for no particular reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One point of note though is that if the Pro2 is already face down when a call comes in, the feature won't be available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Touch Pro2 is the first handset to feature the new StraightTalk technology that according to the manufacturer should improve the telephony experience greatly. Straight talk consists of a bunch of software and hardware updates that should turn the Touch Pro2 in the ultimate communication tool.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware features include the noise cancelling microphone at the back that reduces the environmental noise during regular calls. This is quite handy when, for example there is much traffic around you or when you are outside on the windy day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also have a hardware microphone mute button at the back which might be handy on some occasions. Its functionality is pretty straightforward ? it mutes the phone microphone, making the other party unable to hear what is going on around you. A second press on that button reactivates the mic and everything goes back to normal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other hip hardware feature is the asymmetric dual loudspeakers that should provide enhanced sound experience. Their location as well as that of the microphone mute button suggest that the phone should be used laid face down on a table when in speakerphone mode so everything is at the tip of your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as software update is concerned HTC say that the Touch Pro2 has a new really simple interface but in reality it is hardly too different as far as actual call making is concerned. The only notable difference compared to the Diamond2 is the added conference call shortcut on the call screen which saves you a click when you want to add more parties to a conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calls log on Windows Mobile devices offers practically unlimited entries. HTC have pimped the look of the regular WinMo calls log and have added thumb scrolling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also conducted our traditional speakerphone test to conclude the phone part of the Touch Pro2 review. You aren't likely to miss many calls with it, as it scored a Very good mark, ranking pretty high on our list of tested devices. You can find more details about our test, as well as the results of all other tested handsets here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Awesome messenger<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 supports SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a message editor and thanks to TouchFLO, you can enjoy thumb scrolling in the inboxes and through longer messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Message tab offers a great interface for managing messages. With the nice interface and touch-optimization it?s highly unlikely you will ever switch back to the standard Windows SMS inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Threaded SMS is also available on the Touch Pro2, just as it is across Windows Mobile 6.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email inbox is also available as a homescreen tab with an eye-catching view. The email editor will hold no surprises for experienced WinMo users as it has not changed at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up your email is easy as it is on most of the latest mid or high range phones. You type your email and password and all the other fiddly options are configured automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps now is a good time to mention input options on the Touch Pro2. Let?s start with the virtual ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have equipped the device with a set of home-grown thumbable virtual keyboards. It's a commendable feature since the default Windows Mobile keyboards are fit for stylus use only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first keyboard is a regular 9-key multi-tap keypad , the second one is a brand new full QWERTY and the third one is a regular WinMo not-so handy QWERTY optimized for use with a stylus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new QWERTY differs from the previous one in the button architecture and a five-row design that gives you all four navigation arrows in the final row. In landscape mode you get the typical three-row full QWERTY with nav-keys on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In applications where screen auto-rotation is enabled, you also get larger landscape versions of those keyboards. The HTC Touch Pro2 can rotate its screen almost anywhere and use the new and improved landscape QWERTY keyboard. It seems that HTC have taken user feedback on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally we are pretty sure you?ll use these virtual solutions extremely rare because of the hardware full QWERTY keyboard, which is one of the best we have seen in a mobile phone. The keys are big enough, the gaps between them eliminate the chance to hit two letters in the same time and the button?s places are very well situated.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The multimedia is well equipped<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 offers a small amount of storage ? about 300MB. This is barely sufficient and you?ll definitely find yourself needing a higher-capacity microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager is the standard Windows Mobile one and won?t surprise anyone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery stands for excellence<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro2 offers a nice thumbnail browser straight from the Photos and Videos tab on the Home screen. There's another thumbnail browser in the Album app available from the context menu on the Home screen or from the Programs menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image is opened automatically in landscape mode and there is no option to rotate it to portrait view. Still that?s not a bad thing because it means the photos you take with the camera are always properly displayed. Once the image is opened, you can zoom in or out using the new touch-zoom bar or continue to the previous/next by sweeping a finger on the current one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old circular gesture is also available, but in most cases doesn?t work properly or completely and we think it found its place in the final software by accident. Anyway, if you try hard enough you might manage to make it zoom that way, but we think it?s a feature that should be removed in any future firmware updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling to the next image is smooth and instantaneous with a single sweep of the finger. And also zooming in and out is extra fast, as well. The Zoom bar comes quite handy for that purpose.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got to be said that the Touch Pro2 has a certain advantage over competing devices when it comes to image browsing since this is one of the applications where WVGA really makes a difference - the images look stunning on the high resolution screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>iPod-style music player as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like the previous Pro, the Touch Pro2 has a good music player that makes excellent use of Album art. The music player is accessible straight from the TouchFLO home screen with a cool Apple-like Cover Flow animation for you to pick an album from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to filter tracks by other criteria beside album, the Library shortcut will take you to the player backend where you can sort music by artist, genre, composer, purchased tracks or simply create custom playlists. The visual interface of the library is fluid and eerily reminiscent of iPhone's very own music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer presets are available only when you have the headset plugged in. They are not part of the music player itself but of a separate application called Audio Booster. That setup allows you to make use of the presets when you watch videos or even when you listen to music on an alternative player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no 3.5mm audio jack on the Pro2 or on the headset, so unless you get hold of a third-party adapter, you're stuck with the supplied headphones. The headset looks decent enough, but listening to music is not among its strengths and is best left for making phone calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting decision by HTC is also removing the FM radio software. Even more the FM hardware is still there ? hidden in the phone. May be HTC wanted this to be a Diamond2 exclusive feature. Nevertheless of the reason there is a way to unlock the FM radio capabilities and we'll show you that later in the Tweaks and Modding section.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Decent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of the HTC Touch Pro2 is only a tad worse than that on the Diamond2 which we rated as pretty good. It sports a decent frequency response, which only deviates from the +-1db level at the very end of the audible range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings are pretty good, rivaling some dedicated music phones. The total harmonic and intermodulation distortion scores are also decent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the introduction of the Diamond2 and Pro2 HTC made a huge step forward in matching the dedicated music phones audio quality. Not so long ago the WinMo devices were known for their mediocre audio but luckily we got a "myth busted" on this one too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A bunch of video players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>TheTouch Pro2 comes with the standard well known ? and sadly underperforming - Windows Media Player. It only manages mp4 and 3gp and for DivX/XviD support you will need a third party application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 however has a nice additional video player, the same as but it only supports the video/audio codecs available to Windows Mobile in the first place. To enjoy a wider range of video options on the Pro (DiVX or XViD for example), you will probably need to purchase a dedicated video player with additional codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We resorted to the well-known Core player for that purpose and as usual it did a great job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 is pretty good at full-screen video playback - we played an XviD-encoded DVD rip for PC playback and, luckily, there were no skipped frames. Then we tried exactly the same DivX video samples as on the Diamond2 and we experienced the same problems. Playing back those VGA@30fps videos nearly half the frames were dropped, while those at 24fps played just fine. That however is a DivX-specific issue and as XviD encoding is more popular anyway, it doesn?t seem a big deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you might have guessed, videos looked excellent on the Pro2 WVGA display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It was high five, now it?s just poor three<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 has a 3 megapixel auto focus camera (the Diamond2 has 5 megapixel one) producing photos with a maximum resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels. The camera offers an intuitive user interface and shoots in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It lacks a dedicated camera key AGAIN so, in order to take a picture you can just touch the virtual key, the camera focuses on the frame center and takes the shot automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro2 camera also lacks a LED flash, but our team is not super keen on LED flashes anyway so we don't count this as a serious flaw.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Interface and features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro2 viewfinder is free of any overlaying controls by default but you can display those by touching the dedicated key under the ?capture? button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of camera features, the HTC Touch Pro has the usual and offers the standard self-timer, white balance presets, ISO settings (up to ISO800), color effects and a viewfinder gridline. You can shoot images with the front-facing video-call camera too and there's some nice custom resolution settings for contacts' images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the biggest letdown with the camera is the lack of geotagging, and it?s beyond us why they left that out much like with the HTC Touch HD. Nevertheless, we have found a free third-party fix for that, but we'll discuss it in the Tweaks &amp; Modding chapter of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Touch Pro2 you can shoot macro images easily without needing to change modes. However focusing in close-up is rather hard and is somewhat hit-or-miss - sometimes the Touch Pro focuses correctly, while other times it's way off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a panorama mode that offers on-screen framing guidance. After all the individual shots for the panorama are taken, the Touch Pro2 stitches the images together automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downside here is that in Panorama mode each individual image is shot at roughly 480 x 480 pixels and the images are quite badly stitched together. Obviously the Panorama mode is only ok if you intend to show your images on the handset display exclusively (which is exactly 480 pixels wide) with no further zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were really impressed with the HTC Touch Diamond2 photos taken with its 5 megapixel snapper. We expected something similar with the Touch Pro2 camera samples, but at last we are completely confused.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality can't even be called satisfying ? the image detail is around normal but the colors are not even close to reality, the sharpening is extreme at some places (look at the mountain on the first sample), add the purple fringing and missing detail in the sky. As far as we are concerned those are quite poor camera samples. We really hope HTC will have those fixed ia a firmware upgrade soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro2 video capturing capabilities are not impressive at all ? VGA recording at 15 fps. Given the video capabilities of many modern phones and bearing in mind the powerful Pro2 CPU, we really expected more, just like we did with the Diamond2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But what we didn't expect at all is the video quality ? it's well below the decent line, the detail is levels below normal, the colors are not accurate at some places and sometimes the picture is just blurred. The biggest problem of course is the low frame rate, and it?s really not what we?ve come to expect in such a high-end device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder resembles the one of the still camera. You can only adjust the white balance, the resolution, brightness and finally add some color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is&nbsp;a sample VGA video (1.5MB)&nbsp;produced by the Touch Pro2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Full pack connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connectivity the HTC Touch Pro2 has it all ? HSDPA 7.2Mbps, HSUPA 2Mbps, Wi-Fi, stereo Bluetooth + EDR.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro2 has quad-band GSM support and dual-band 3G ? 900 and 2100 MHz bands are supported (that is Europe and the like). You can check out our Worldwide Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 is supported as well through a miniUSB adaptor. Actually it?s extUSB, but miniUSB cables fit just fine, and the port also serves audio input and output. When connected to a computer, the Touch Pro2 prompts you to select among ActiveSync, Mass Storage or Modem modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Mass Storage mode, the memory card is handled as a removable drive on the computer for faster file transfers. The only downside is in this mode you have no access to the memory card from the handset itself ? the card is simply invisible to the file manager.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing is top-notch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 as usual comes with the Opera v9.5 browser. There?s IE Mobile if you really want it, but the default browser launched from the homescreen is Opera. And with good reason, since it puts IE Mobile to shame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Opera browser is extensively touch-optimized and draws inspiration from the iPhone?s Safari. The browser has matured since its inclusion in the Touch HD and now exhibits no rendering bugs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser is heavily optimized towards vertical scrolling ? it zooms through complex pages without missing a beat. Panning sideways is a little slower ? a checkerboard pattern appears for a moment before the content is drawn, but this lasts for no more than a second so it?s no big issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming in and out is also very fast. Here the Zoom bar can be used or you could opt for the regular double-tap zoom. Double tapping is more accurate as it zooms in to where you tapped, eliminating the need for much panning. On the other hand, the Zoom bar gives you finer control over the zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The WVGA resolution of the display helps navigation a great deal ? at the minimum zoom level text is readable enough for you to find the section of the text you?re interested in and double tapping takes you straight there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In landscape mode, the minimum zoom fits most pages, while strangely in portrait mode you can zoom out even more, but then the text becomes unreadable. The orientation is changed automatically of course, thanks to the built-in accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As the Touch Pro2 offers automatic screen rotation inside the web browser, the Opera 9.5 offers a landscape QWERTY keyboard, but in the presence of the hardware one this option won?t be necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And a few words about the Opera 9.5 interface. By default web pages are opened fullscreen free of any overlaying controls. A tap on the bottom right corner, however, brings up the available controls. When entering a URL there?s a special ?.com? button on the keypad, saving a few presses.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First, you've got the address bar at the very top. At the bottom of the screen there is a row of icons that can take you back, take you to bookmarks, bring up the tab switcher (you can open up to two tabs), the home page or the browser settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opera 9.5 has a handy download manager which tracks the progress of the files you?re downloading.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizing your life is just easy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are easily syncable with Outlook. In the Touch Pro2 the standard interface is kept under wraps ? the only times you catch a glimpse of it are when creating or viewing an appointment. The homescreen only shows the basics ? time and subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers daily, weekly, monthly and even yearly views, although the TouchFLO 3D interface shows only daily and monthly views. If you want the others you?ll have to do without the pretty TouchFLO skin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing tasks, you can also see weather information for that particular day if available. The TouchFLO 3D preloads the weather forecast for up to 5 days ahead of the last update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list allows you to add tasks and assign them priority. The Notes also come in handy, as you can either type or directly write the text down on the screen. The Voice recorder and Calculator need no explanation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has three alarm slots. Each Alarm can have its own repeat pattern. Unfortunately, due to the limited customization options in the default Alarms application, we suggest you check out some free third-party alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Document editor is not forgotten<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the other WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of Office Mobile, you also have the OneNote application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, the WVGA display of the Touch Pro2 proves superior in fitting as much of the documents contents on the screen as possible ? especially in portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Adobe Reader LE, there is also support for viewing PDF documents. We are again pleased (first in Diamond2) with the performance of the Touch Pro2 in this area, as opening and handling PDF documents is usually rather slow on handhelds.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Applications and more<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Touch Pro2 comes with plenty of preloaded applications ? the essentials are already installed, which means you can start using them straight away. There?s the regular stuff such as an RSS Reader, a YouTube application and a Streaming Media manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we?ve come to expect from HTC, their admirable Task Manager comes preinstalled. It blends in with the TouchFLO 3D interface seamlessly and is convenient for switching between open apps or stopping them (not that there?s any shortage of RAM, but still).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Task Manager is available, as always in the top right corner of the homescreen. You can also access it through the settings menu, which comes in handy since an application?s close button replaces the Task Switcher button. This does hamper its task-switching ability a little and we?d have liked to see a more elegant solution to the problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RSS Hub app is an RSS reader for staying up-to-date with the latest news and content at your favorite web places. The Streaming Media manager allows access to custom sources of streaming audio and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that has become a part of the HTC experience is the well-known Teeter game. The game is simple ? by tilting the phone, you must guide a ball to an end point avoiding holes along the way. The graphics are polished and accurate vibrations each time your ball hits the walls of the maze make it very fun to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YouTube application is here again. It offers a fluid, excellent looking interface ? shinier than even the iPhone?s.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Developers have had plenty of time to adapt their applications to WVGA resolution thanks to the Touch HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another application is the rather handy Search software, capable of searching throughout applications and the whole file system. You have the option to set filters so that the application searches only in the places you need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GPS does matter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Touch Pro2 features a built-in GPS receiver - it's the Qualcomm gpsOne chipset, which comes along with the Qualcomm 7200A platform.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro2 supports the Assisted-GPS technology, commonly known as A-GPS. It means you can download current satellite data over Wi-Fi or the 2G/3G network for a much faster GPS satellite lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Touch Pro2 comes with Google Maps. With a more advanced GPS app installed, the handset can easily replace your dedicated GPS navigation unit thanks to the large screen. Given the huge pixel count, a lot more of the map gets displayed on screen at the same zoom level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chipset sensitivity of the HTC Touch Pro2 seems to be on the faster side when it comes to getting an initial satellite lock. Overall, we?re pretty happy with the sensitivity of the gpsOne chipset.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks &amp; Modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And we've finally reached the real fun part of this review - at least for us, that is. PocketPCs have long been the target of custom modding, patching and tweaking. HTC for one have an especially active fan base that seem to be constantly poking and prodding to optimize the usability of their device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the HTC Touch Pro2 review would not be complete without mentioning some of the achievements on the user customization and modding scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most tweaks require modifying the Windows Mobile registry. However, in case you feel anxious about messing with the system registry, you can find most of the currently available tweaks among the options of the third-party Advanced Configuration Tool (or simply the Advanced Config).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Advanced Configuration Tool is a tweaking app, now compatible with Touch Pro2, just as it was with the new Diamond. It allows you to fine-tune a lot of settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For instance, you can replace the battery in the taskbar with a clock, change splash screens, and change a lot of performance related settings. You can learn more about it and download it here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To be able to use the Advanced Configuration Tool you will also need to download Microsoft .NET Compact Framework (here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And now, it's time for something odd. The HTC Touch Pro2 comes with an inbuilt FM radio (RDS capable, by the way) but there is no software preloaded to let you take advantage of it. Is it because they wanted to differentiate the Touch Pro2 from HTC Touch Diamond2? We doubt it. Whatever the strange reason behind this mysterious move, users will not have to put up with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, with the help of the talented guys over at XDA developers' forum we managed to make the built-in FM radio work. And it works great: you just need to plug the headset in and to choose a station. As far as the interface is concerned, it is the same as the one on Touch Diamond2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also managed to activate the geo-tagging feature of the camera. It allows saving the location information in the EXIF file of the image. It is very strange why HTC decided to deactivate this feature even if the hardware and the software support it. By the way, along with the geo-tagging we activated some other extra camera features like Burst and Sports modes and the Video Share and MMS Video features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Burst mode you can take a sequence of 30 images at a time and in Sports mode - 5. The Video Share and the MMS Video options allow you to send automatically the videos you take via email or MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All these and many more features can be activated or deactivated using the Registry Editor application, which is totally free, but as usual when messing with the registry always act cautiously and don't touch entries that you don't understand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So here's a link that describes the WM registry entries that need changing to enable those options on the HTC Touch Pro2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sequel is the buzz word yet again, and 2 is still more and better. But then, we can't help the nagging little feeling that it was a bit easier to say that about the Diamonds than it is with the Pros.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The updated TouchFLO 3D, the utterly revamped exterior, the bigger screen and the HTC Touch HD genes are the undoubted assets of both the new Diamond and the new Pro. But while the Diamond2 grew in size with grace, the Pro2 may have crossed the line and fallen back to TyTN II kind of bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But hey, we're not gonna hold size that much against the Touch Pro2. The excellent screen and the perfect QWERTY keyboard will shut us up anyway. Plus, there isn't even a shadow of a doubt that the Pro2 just blows the TyTN II in terms of ergonomics. We wouldn't have moaned about the camera either if it wasn't for the image quality. We can live with no upgrade in pixel count but poor photos we won't stand for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like it or not, the Touch Pro2 gets away with poor imaging too. It's got business on its mind and graciously lets the Diamond2 cater to a different set of users. So, if the first thing on your mind was Diamond2 or Touch Pro2, the answer is not so easy. It's a question of business or pleasure, QWERTY and Straight Talk or style and imaging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Touch Diamond2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for alternatives, if you are into PocketPCs you can hitch a ride with the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1. It offers much similar specs, and the blending of Sony Ericsson and HTC bloodlines has produced a rock solid performer. The choice will be between TouchFLO 3D and XPERIA panels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An intriguing debut will also compete with the Touch Pro2 for a seat at your table. Acer M900 is about to be thrown in the PocketPC skirmish and is all set to accommodate Windows Mobile Professional 6.5 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Acer M900</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On Symbian turf, the Nokia N97 is on its way to the shelves and we're about to see if the couple of days headstart will be any good for the Touch Pro2 in this battle of platforms. The touch-enabled Symbian-powered N97 is ready to fire with a big screen, QWERTY keyboard, 32GB internal storage, much better camera and Nseries media skill. Its QWERTY keyboard is a 3-row piece only, but it's the only other contemporary mobile with a tilting screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia N97</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you already saw in this review, repetition is hard to get around but that's how it goes with Pros and Diamonds, and their sequels. But now the Diamond/Pro relationship takes a new and very important turn. While the QWERTY keyboard was the only distinction between the carbon-copied first batch, the sequels do look different and target diverse user groups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all honesty though,the Diamond2 seems to make a bit more sense than the Touch Pro2 from an upgrader?s point of view. Anyway, an old Pro will always have a trick or two to show off. And you won't be fooled if you fall for the the slide and tilt.</paragraph>
