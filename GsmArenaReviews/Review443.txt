			<paragraph>There is no doubt that the new Samsung i300 smartphone represents the best of the best Windows Mobile OS can offer nowadays. It has a 3GB hard disk, a high-quality display, a unique steering control button as well as plenty of functions, of which the music ones are probably the most successful. The phone's equipment is wrapped up into a compact and quite elegant body.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As smartphones represent a top-class technological achievement in the business with mobile phones, it is a matter of prestige for each manufacturer to be able to offer a smartphone. Hence it is no wonder that a device of that high a category has appeared in the offer list of the Korean company Samsung. By the way, Samsung is known for its tendency to often change the OS of its smartphones. The mobile phone we have just tested - Samsung i300 - was announced with Microsoft Windows Mobile 2005, but the final version works with Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003 OS Second Edition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung i300</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i300 was shown for the first time this year, at the European trade show CeBit, along with several other smartphones: the slider Samsung D720 featuring Symbian Series 60, the clamshell D730, also with a Symbian OS, and the communicator i750, which has a touchscreen and a slide-out keypad, and works with Windows for Pocket PC OS. Yet, Samsung i300 was the most successful in holding visitors' interest, mainly because of its 3GB hard disk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung D720 ? Samsung D730 ? Samsung i750</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>This phone is a tiny spectacle<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When I first saw Samsung i300, I could not help but getting the impression of a quite big and edgy device. However, after having tested the phone for several days now, I would not dare change its size of 113 × 48 × 20 mm even a little bit. The phone is comfortable to hand-hold and stands firmly. The edges are round enough and thus assure easy work. In addition, the location of the control buttons is nearly perfect. It is only the weight of 130 g that makes difference when compared to other mobile phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   It looks like Siemens, doesn't it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nearly half of the front side of the phone is occupied by its big color display. As expected, the latter is active and allows the TFT technology to brilliantly show all its strengths. Display's surface is 3 X 4 cm big. It fits 76800 pixels in a 240 × 320 matrix. Each pixel is able to show 262K colors. The display can fit from 6 to 11 text lines according to the used mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   It sticks to your hand... ? comparison to a credit card</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Samsung i300 display is truly a top-class one. Its quality exceeds all expectations. The graphic image looks very natural due to the combination between high resolution and reasonably big surface. Diagonal lines are far from jaggy. Redrawing speed is exceptional, just like the evenness of the backlighting. The display is perfectly readable under direct sun light as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Display is very good </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Spin it around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Have a look at the discreet silver cover of the receiver. On both its sides there are two color LEDs, which alert you about phone's basic functional states. Personally, I am quite fond of this type of indicators and I am sorry to see that the more the time goes the less it is being applied by the manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real control innovation however can be seen on the block below the display, where 6 functional keys are dominated by a silver control button. The latter is quite strange and at the same time habit-forming. Its silver ring can be used as a standard navigation button. In other words, you can move within the phone and control its functions by pressing the wheel in four ways. A press on the black middle part confirms the choice. The silver ring, however, features an additional peculiarity - it steers both clock- and anticlockwise, in a way similar to the one we know form the iPod first generation music players. A small projection on the ring prevents user's finger from slipping away when steering. Navigation within the phone by means of a steering ring seems to be a most logical and natural solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  All-way control button - can be both pressed and steered  </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The block of functional keys is quite standard. Right below the display you will find a pair of soft keys, followed by the back button and the one for quick access to the main menu. The last to come are the red and the green receiver buttons, which serve incoming and outgoing calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Keypad is extremely comfortable </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad gives no reason for complaints. The keys are made of solid plastic; individual lines are separated by clearly cut spacing and touch orientation is easy. Perhaps the touch marks on the middle key could have been a little bit more tangible. The keys show no delay, their uplift is ideal and their reactions are easy to notice. All this allows for quick and comfortable writing with minor, if not insignificant keying mistakes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Keypad backlighting is deep blue</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Two batteries to let you listen longer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>On the bottom part of the phone you will see the system connector; on the top edge is to be found the dark glass of the infrared port. The left side of the Samsung i300 features silver volume buttons, a start-key for the built-in music player, a button, which opens the voice application and a plug-in connector for the earphones. The opposite side of the phone is no poorer. Here, you can start the camera, lock the keypad or switch off the phone application of the device, thus using it as a pocket computer only. I should not forget to mention the TransFlash memory card slot. Samsung deserves a compliment for the brilliant elaboration of the covers of all connectors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Left side elements ? cover for the earphones connector ? memory card slot is protected as well</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Buttons mounted in the upper part of the phone's right side ? system connector and its cover ? and, of course, an eyelet for a strip</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backside of the phone is dominated by the camera lens, accompanied by a flash LED and a convex glass, which facilitates self-portraits making. If you pay a bit more attention, you will also notice the slots of the built-in stereo speakers, situated on both sides of the phone, just above the battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Each side of the phone features a speaker grid ? the camera in the company of a flash LED and a tiny mirror</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The original accumulator delivered with the phone has 1000 mAh capacity. It creates an integral unit together with the cover shell. As for the battery life, it is neither bad, nor exceptional. If you play a lot with the phone and especially if you use the built-in hard disk, you will need to charge it approximately every other day. Another accumulator of higher capacity is also available. It holds twice longer and is meant to help you make it through a longer weekend, for example. Its only drawback is its bigger size. When inserted in the phone, it makes it look quite bulky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   The back cover constitutes a part of the battery ? and is decorated with manufacturer's logo and web address</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Samsung i300 with the standard battery ? and the bigger one (not only in terms of capacity)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The synchronizing cradle is able to charge both the phone and the battery. Its design is quite robust and it holds firmly on the table. It has an output not only for the charging adapter, but also for the USB cable, which can be consequently plugged into the PC.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of space<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When a PalmOne PDA with a built-in hard disk first hit the market at the beginning of this year, the public was overwhelmed. A hard disk installed in a mobile phone, however, is incredible!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i300 is able to store a huge amount of data thanks to the Cornice 0.8" hard disk with 3 GB capacity (2871 MB formatted to be exact). It is even smaller than the famous CF Type II hard disks, whose size is comparable with a CompactFlash card. What disappointed me was its transfer speed. When I connected the phone to my PC as a standard hard disk, I made several tests that revealed a lot of interesting details. First of all I found out that the phone works with the slow USB 1.1 interface. What's worse, not even with the new hard disk is it able to make full use of the speed of the old USB standard. The average speed, with which the phone opened and downloaded big files, was 0.72 MB/s.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>No changes in Windows<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The control system in Samsung i300 is basically identical to those in other phones with the same OS. The only exception here is its unusual navigation component, i.e. the steering wheel. Even though the navigation mode in a smartphone with Windows Mobile OS differs a little bit from the one in common mobile phones, it is easy to learn. What I cannot get used to is that in certain situations the phone does not let me make a step back in the menu by only using the key designated for this very function, and I have to press another functional key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Detailed information about the OS </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu consists of a long list with applications, sorted into several sections, each of which has 9 items. Unfortunately, the phone does not allow for reordering the menu according to one's will. It only lets you remember the shortcuts for various applications. Yet, if you install a certain program and it makes its way to the center of the menu, you will simply have to start memorizing short keys once again, from the very beginning. The shortcut keys alone work well. To open a preset application, just press and hold the appropriate number key. The phone memorizes up to 99 different application shortcuts. If you need to use a two-position shortcut, press the first number key and then press and hold the second one. Within the phone you will find approximately 50 MB of free storage memory. Samsung i300 also has 39 MB of RAM reserved for running programs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Stand-by display ? Start menu and its list of accessible applications</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i300 smartphone is quite fast, it does not make you wait at all. Running applications do not close down; instead, the system minimizes them automatically in the background if it needs more working memory. If you need to close down an application manually, use the Task Manager.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music comes first<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i300 is a music mobile phone. It has an excellent player, able to open various formats. The player sorts files by artist or album name and, of course, it reads files from the directory tree.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the 3 GB of memory on the hard disk is not quite enough for you, you can save additional multimedia data on the microSD(TransFlash) memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Selecting files for the library ? Selecting music to be played from the library</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound quality is brilliant due to the good earphones, which are equipped with a special connector. As their cable carries a control button and a microphone, they can also be used as a handsfree set. Yet, there is no doubt that proficient music fans would rather use the additional adapter that is to be found in the delivery box for this way they can plug any other type of earphones into the phone by using a standard 3.5 mm jack. Besides, the adapter itself is equipped with a control button and a microphone too. It also has a useful pin to fix to one's clothes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Original earphones ? adapter for standard earphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music can be listened to through a pair of stereo speakers as well. For such a small device the sound performance is praiseworthy indeed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Calling application is nearly perfect!<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here we get to all those functions that are, but certain slight exceptions, identical in all smartphones that work with that same OS. Frankly said, I am not writing everything from the very beginning but keep to the Motorola MPX220 review, editing it or enriching it, if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Phone functions in Samsung i300 are very good. It is most obvious during a phone call, where the sound is clear and loud enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook synchronizes instantly with Microsoft Outlook. Each contact person can be assigned up to 44 different fields including details as wife's name, children's names and assistant's name and contact info. In other words, what we are offered here is a mobile edition of Outlook. Each name can also be assigned an individual ringing melody as well as a picture (through an independent application). The latter is not possible to synchronize though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Phonebook ? searching ? detailed view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook search is brilliant. You need to just press the necessary letter keys - each one only once, just like in the T9 dictionary. For example, if I need to find the name Novak, I have to press 6 (N) - 6 (O) - 8 (V) - each of which once - and a list of related contacts shows up. And if I press 2 (A), it is nearly sure that the searched name will pop up. What's more, search does not have to be necessarily done through the phonebook, you can write names directly from the main display too. You can also search by the last name - the phone does not make any difference for it goes through both fields simultaneously. Who has not tried this method, would hardly come to believe how habit-forming it is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the numbers assigned to each contact name is set as default - the one that can be dialed by a simple press on the green receiver. To get to the rest of the numbers, press the ring to the left or to the right and you will see their list on the display. Or view all contact details and select the number you need to dial.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i300 offers ringing profiles, which you can additionally modify to your will. One of the profiles deactivates the transmitter so that the phone can be used on an airplane, for example. Groups are taken from the address book in Outlook and can be consequently used as filters for the phonebook. What the phone does not allow for is dividing the groups into such that can reach you and others that can not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The polyphonic ringtones feature 64 voices. Yet I could not help myself and almost immediately downloaded my favorite MP3 file. What came afterwards was a huge disappointment. The problem is that Samsung i300 - similarly to some HTC models - does not support MP3 as ringing melodies. Fortunately, you can use the WMA format. The phone also offers two options of vibration ringing - vibration that is executed before the ringing melody starts playing and vibration that runs both before and simultaneously with the melody. The alert type has to be set centrally. The profiles only have impact on the volume and other likewise parameters.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messages and email<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let me know write a few words about the message functions in i300. The phone works with email messages (both POP3 and IMAP), SMS and MMS. Each type group is viewed as a separate list. Let us however start with the common SMS. When activated for the first time and before having been saved into the memory, the SMS application takes quite a long time to start. You will also have to wait a few seconds before you get to the editor. When you write SMS, simply enter the phone number of the recipient or select it from the phonebook, just like I described it above, in phonebook section. The editor counts and shows the signs already written as well as the number of component messages a longer text is divided into. There can be more than 50 of them...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Creating a SMS ? would you like a delivery notification?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SMS editor is equipped with a T9 dictionary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Received messages list ? reading a message ? a list with predefined messages</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again I had to struggle with the MMS setup for a little while. What I am certain about this application is that it is far from being intuitive. The MMS editor is comfortable and fast. A MMS can carry text, pictures, videos and music files. The editor supports display paging. In addition, each picture can be pre-timed. The recipient search, however, seems to me quite unpractical. Not only does not the T9 dictionary help you with this task (as it does in the phonebook, for example), but it is not even possible to search the recipient by the first letter of their name - you simply have to go through the entire list...</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email browser supports 5 accounts of POP3 or IMAP4 type and synchronizes with Outlook... You can also use SSL security and SMTP server authentication. You can choose how old the messages that are downloaded should be too. The phone downloads entire emails or their headers only; or something in between: the first 500, 1000 or 5000 characters. In addition, the email client can be set to check the content of your email box in regular intervals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email application opens all known attachments: pictures, video, sounds, text files. What the installed version of the Windows Mobile OS does not support are office applications. To view the content of Word documents or Excel spreadsheets (but not to edit them) will help you the Picsel Viewer, which is not part of the OS. The phone lets you directly reply to emails, send them, forward or move them to another folder. Email writing can be facilitated by using the T9 dictionary too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MSN Messenger instant messaging program is also available as a standard part of the Windows Mobile OS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Time organizer, data<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone has a calendar with a day, a week and a month view. Once again, synchronizing is brilliant. It covers all the details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;&nbsp; Month ? week ? and day view at the events</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the calendar the task manager is much too simple. It relies on the fact that the user will keep synchronizing every detail with their PC. In the phone alone the Task manager will not let you insert but a simple note. At the same time, this smartphone does not have a special, independent note function; it only offers a voice recorder, which is able to record a call, besides all the rest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Samsung i300 does not feature EDGE. Data transfers are executed through GPRS Class 10. As the data transfer counter is not a standard part of the original equipment of the phone, you will need to install it additionally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Samsung i300 can be connected to a PC through a classic cable, an infrared port or through Bluetooth. Inside the phone you will find Internet Explorer, which also helps you open and read WAP pages. During the outside tests I used GPRS. When I was in the immediate vicinity of a PC, the phone used Bluetooth to share the computer's connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for web pages, they can be viewed in three modes - either like in a standard computer, where the pages need to be scrolled vertically and horizontally, or in a column, or in the form of a text without any layout formatting. The browser itself is neither that fast, nor that good to be worth further description.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>     Internet browser </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Treat the camera with patience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera of Samsung i300 features one very annoying characteristic... - it is slow. Once a picture has been taken, the camera needs several long seconds to get ready for another one. Thus, two consequent pictures take no less than 15 seconds. The shutter release works with significant delays too: in fact, the phone captures the scene long two seconds after the release button has been pressed and the sound has been played. The setup options of the camera are quite standard. The quality of the pictures is very good, but cannot be qualified as exceptional.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Digital zoom samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The digital zoom is 4x. The quality of its output is more or less satisfying. Regarding the video application, it is utterly useless. What I am trying to figure out - evidently in vain - is why it cannot be as good as the one in the D600 model...</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Will it beat Nokia N91?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no doubt that Samsung i300 is a top-class phone with brilliant features. I am also sure that it will meet the requirements of the most demanding customers. It can be used both for work and fun. Its one and only serious drawback is the slow data transfer. In fact, EDGE, Wi-Fi or 3G network support should have been implemented in a phone of such a high class. I was also disappointed when realized that unlike its initial promises, Samsung i300 wont use the latest version of the Windows Mobile OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price of the phone is expected to stay below 660 euros.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this moment, the only competitor Samsung i300 could be compared to is Nokia N91. N91 is the only other phone on the current market equipped with a built-in hard disk, which is even bigger than the one in Samsung, offering the unbelievable 4 GB. Nokia N91 works with Symbian OS, has a megapixel camera and supports Wi-Fi, EDGE and 3G networks. On the other hand, Samsung i300 is smaller and lighter. Besides, I think it is far more attractive than Nokia N91 as far as design is concerned.</paragraph>
