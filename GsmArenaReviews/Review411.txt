			<paragraph>A new LG phone has hit the streets. The possible suspect is described as black, slim, sexy and most of all fashionable. Well then, we might just have some information on that suspect, Mr. Officer. The LG Chocolate phone is a gorgeous mobile phone offering a red-glowing navigation touchpad, 128MB of internal memory, 1.3 megapixel camera and MP3 player, tri-band GSM and GPRS support - all that incorporated into a slim slider shell.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Key features:<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Main disadvantages:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone features an innovative touchpad which is used for menu navigation and it's a wonderful piece of design which really adds to the classy overall feel of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, as regards the technical side of the device, there aren't any posh features that would stun the regular tech buffs. The phone is mainly targeted at a market niche of expensive designer phones which have the main purpose of distinguishing their owners from the general crowd. And as such it should be viewed in its own right taking into account its marketing specifics. So if you are one of the people out there hoping that LG KG800 might turn out as the next Walkman competitor or the next beat-'em-all camera phone, we only have 2 words for you: Keep waiting!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyways, we really liked this phone, and as a matter of fact, all the people around us liked it even better, so there's a trick or two that this party slider hides in its sleeves. Talking about sleeves, let's roll up ours and get down to work in order to show you what this baby can offer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone we had was a test sample so we should warn you that there might be some differences to the final version, though this software version behaved perfectly alright and we didn't stumble upon any obvious bugs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   </paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the stylish retail package, the box should include a stereo headset, a pouch, a neck strap, a MP3 remote control with a 3.5 mm jack, a USB cable, a travel charger and a software CD containing the proprietary LG PC Suite software but as we have always said - the contents of the retail package are market and country dependant.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Exquisite shell<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The front part of the phone shell has a mirror-like finish that really makes it look classy. When closed, the slider has a rather monolith construction so there were a few people that tried opening it as a flip phone instead of a slider. That's really something since mobile phones nowadays are invading every part of our lives so to be able to produce something innovative really counts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we saw the handset for the first time, sliding out of its LG branded black velvet pouch, we were amazed at how thin it looked. We could hardly believe that it was over 15 mm thick so we had to measure it ourselves. Well, it really is just over 15 mm thick but you could never really tell by just by looking at it - it looks a lot thinner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Chocolate held in hand: side views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact one of the first impressions we had were that the phone hidden in its pouch resembles in a great way a stylish and highly expensive cigar lighter that a real connoisseur always has within their reach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Chocolate and its pouch</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would expect this phone to be a more of a women's accessory than a men's toy but it turned out that the unisex design and the slim and fashionable body fit and appeal equally both to men and women.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>When style meets class<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When closed, in fact you could only really see a black shiny surface and a silver rectangle that surrounds the central OK button on the touchpad - the display and the red touchpad lay hidden beneath the shiny surface. When you slide up the upper part, the touchpad and the display light up waiting for your commands. The sight of the red glowing touchpad could easily grab any person's heart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG Chocolate general outline views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The newly revealed numeric part of the keypad is crafted in a great way and is really easy to use. The numeric keypad incorporates an interesting design solution since some of the keys are made out of matt plastic and others out of glossy plastic. The different keys are then spread in a checkerboard way across the whole keypad and that makes it very attractive. In fact this checker-board styled keypad and the keys shape resemble a lot like pieces of a chocolate bar. That's one of the reasons for calling the phone The Chocolate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG Chocolate numeric keypad</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real place where this beauty gets its name is from the fact that in the Korean market where this baby was pioneered, it has a scent of chocolate. Yes, you heard us right - the phone smells of chocolate. But enough of that, let's get back to our review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the handset incorporates only a volume swing key. The right side has more to show. There we see a camera/mp3 player shortcut key and the ON/OFF key. The ON/OFF key in fact serves several roles among which ending or rejecting a call. The camera/mp3 player shortcut button is an unusual solution since we hardly see a combined shortcut key for both applications - pressing the key shortly opens the multimedia menu, while a long press takes you directly to the MP3 player. The left side of the thin panel also accommodates the multi-purpose USB/earphones/charger port which is hidden under a protective cap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Chocolate side views ? The multipurpose port cap</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset comes with a MP3 cable remote that plugs in the phone multi-purpose port and that has FFD, REW, PLAY/PAUSE, ANSWER/HANG UP and STOP buttons. The remote itself has a standard 3.5 mm audio jack used for the LG earpieces that come in the box as well as any other headphones of your choice. We would have admired the fact that the manufacturer allows you to use high-quality headphones if you want to if it wasn't for the mediocre capabilities of the MP3 player itself. Anyways, the earpieces are not much better - the sound lacks bass elements and the minimal volume level is much too loud.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Chocolate MP3 cable remote and earpieces</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back part has a clean design and accommodates only external antenna jack cap and the battery cover. When the phone is opened you could see the camera lens and the LED flash. The battery cover is situated in the lower back part and is part of the 800 mAh Lithium-Ion Polymer battery itself. According to the manufacturer the battery should offer up to 200h of standby time and up to 6h of talk time. Of course those numbers are strictly indicative. Unfortunately, we couldn't test the Chocolate battery life since we used the phone heavily during our tests and thus the battery life we experienced was not indicative for the real-life performance of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Back panel view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover is hard to disengage in fact. It opens with a slide after you press the release button. But you should press the button strong enough until it sinks in. The matter is furthermore complicated by the fact that when you try to slide the battery cover out you really slide out the phone itself first. The SIM card is easy to get in and out of its bed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Melting in your hands<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The slider mechanism opens with an ease but it won't open incidentally by itself in your pockets or bag since the retaining/opening spring is stiff enough to prevent that. In fact the opening of the phone feels very pleasant and its smooth surface definitely adds up to that feeling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Side views</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Being all glossy, the outer surface catches fingerprints exceptionally easy. The good news is that the LG-branded pouch that come in the retail package along with the phone really helps in keeping it clean since the material it's made of is the perfect cloth to clean the phone's surface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchpad buttons surely take some time to get used to. Most of the people that happened to hold the phone for a couple of minutes usually managed to dial some number by mistake or to load the web browser home page. We got to admit that it's confusing in the beginning but the great looks of the touch pad surely deserve the extra effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interesting thing is that the touchpad uses conductivity in order to operate, so basically you activate the button with the electrolyte on you fingers skin. The manufacturer advises not to touch the touch pad with metallic objects and never to use it with wet fingers and even wipe moisture from the touch pad if there is some because otherwise it might damage the sensors. We unsuccessfully tried pressing the touch pad with a pencil so we might conclude that it isn't likely that you could press some keys incidentally in your pocket. What is more the touch pad is automatically deactivated when the slider is closed. It's also deactivated when you dial a number since otherwise you might press who-knows-what with your cheek.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you get used to navigating with touching instead of pressing, the menu navigation works like a charm and the menu response is very quick - in fact this menu system has one of the greatest response times we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG Chocolate held in hand: frontal view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The numeric keypad is exceptionally good though with decent sized and well spaced keys that are very easy to distinguish even without looking at them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backlighting is pretty good. We want to point out that when you turn on the Power Saving feature of the phone the backlighting of the numeric keypad also gets constantly turned off. Otherwise when you don't use the phone all lights go out and in order to check for missed calls, received messages or simply for what time it is you should open the slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Touchpad and numeric keypad glowing in the dark</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the key lock is turned on closing the slider locks the availability of user input unless you open it up back again. If you decide to leave the key lock off, which we did, the touch pad is again deactivated when you close the slider but you can activate it back again and even browse the menu while it is closed by simply pressing twice the side volume key.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Imagining the image<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 262K color TFT display of the LG Chocolate phone is not bad at all but it fails to impress with a resolution of 176 x 220 pixels. The display has dimensions of 31x33 mm. Legibility of the display under direct sunlight is very good with one exception - and that is reading something under sunlight when the there are some fingerprints left on the display. The display also doesn't have wide viewing angles and you should generally view it directly head on otherwise you risk of seeing wrong colors or brightness. So to sum up, it's not the best display you could get and the resolution really doesn't cut the mustard nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG display</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talking is what it's all about<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our overall impression is that the phone is fairly good at what it was built mainly for - making and receiving calls with no bells and whistles. The real polyphonic sounds of bells and whistles on the other hand sound wonderfully pleasant. They are loud and clear and one shouldn't miss a call even in a crowded street. If you still manage to miss the bells and whistles, no pun intended, the vibration is strong enough. The MP3 ringing is also loud but really lacks bass elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the peculiarities of the handset is that the speaker that you use for conversations on the front panel is used as a loudspeaker for the ringing melodies. That is why the volume level of the ringer is limited to 3 when the slide is open. Talking about loudspeakers, it's worth mentioning that the phone doesn't offer loudspeaker capabilities during a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the handset has a very good signal reception and the voices during call have a pleasant depth and sufficient loudness. That provides for pleasant conversations even in noisy streets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Delving even further<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The standby screen of the handset displays info about the battery status and signal strength. The carrier's name can be turned off and we find that a really pleasant feature that should be seen in other phones too. In standby the two soft keys correspond to the Main Menu and the Contacts menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Standby screen</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main menu is a 3 x 3 grid matrix of icons which get zoomed in when you select them. Their graphics are rather grainy and don't please the exacting eye but it seems that it appealed to most people that saw it. We suppose that the graininess is due to the relatively low resolution and as such it's rather a subjective perception depending on what resolution you are used to. We must admit that the overall color scheme and icons match perfectly the design of the phone. And if you look carefully the design of the main menu grid you will notice that each icon is positioned in a black square which in fact copies the design of the numeric keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Main menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The submenus are viewed as a list. Generally speaking the phone lacks any complicated settings and doesn't require lengthy set-ups. Here are the nice wallpapers that come preinstalled with the handset. It should be noted that you can set any image file as a wallpaper as long as it doesn't exceed 100k in size, for others you should use the proprietary PC Suite software that come on CD with the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Preset wallpapers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu can be viewed in two color combinations - either black or silver, which match equally well the overall design and looks of the LG Chocolate. There are no visual themes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Two color schemes: silver &amp; black</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In standby the four navigation keys each have a predefined shortcut function. If you wish you could visualize the respective assigned functions of the standby screen in order to make your life easier. We found it a preferred option in the first couple of days we used the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pressing the LEFT key takes you to the Profile shortcut menu. Pressing the DOWN key naturally takes you to the Phonebook list. Pressing the RIGHT key takes you to a special functional menu that allows you to open the Messages menu, check your voicemail messages, schedule an appointment in the Organizer or schedule an Alarm. Pressing the UP key takes you to the Favorites menu which is a list of shortcuts which is user-configurable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Standby screen shortcut menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's a good thing that all the menu items have numeric shortcuts assigned to them. You can see those in front of every menu item while browsing the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Numeric shortcut icons in the beginning of each row ? dialing a colorful number</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also an interesting option to colorize the phone numbers when dialing in order to distinguish the individual numbers more easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Plenty of space, clumsy interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook is about average and all we can say about it is that it does it job on a satisfactory level. The phonebook doesn't have a dedicated main menu icon; instead strangely enough it's positioned under the Organizer menu item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook capacity is 1000 contacts which is more than enough for most users. Search is performed through gradual typing of a name's characters. The phonebook allows the storing of 4 numbers /mobile, home, office, fax/ and an email. Further on the contact can be included into a caller group or can be assigned a picture. All the available options are showed into separate screens. Generally the phonebook interface has a clumsy design and reminds the phonebook interface of older mobile phones regarding the way the options are ordered and altered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>       Phonebook search ? Different contact fields: clumsy and inconvenient</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned any contact can be assigned a picture. There are several limitations to that. Firstly, there are some restrictions to the picture itself - it has to be in .bmp format and it has to be of 72 x 72 pixels size. Now the camera has a dedicated mode for taking pictures of that kind so that helps a lot but still it's an inconvenience that you cannot use regular .jpg picture files. What's more, you cannot even upload your own photo from the PC because for some unknown reason .bmp files are not listed in the phone file browser after you upload them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting solution is the option to view the contacts list along with the respective pictures. It's a cool solution but poses certain inconvenience since the picture hides some characters from the contacts names.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Viewing the contacts with pictures</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another limitation to the phonebook is that you cannot assign a ringtone to a certain contact of your choice. The only way to do that is by including the contact in a caller group and assigning a specific ringtone to the caller group itself. The phone has several preinstalled caller groups which can be customized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each caller group has its icon and that can be shown in front of the respective members' names in the contacts list in order to recognize easily which group they belong to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Caller groups list with their respective icons</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another limitation of the phonebook is that you cannot save a second or a third number to an already existing contact directly from the standby screen. For that you have to find the contact in the phonebook and enter the Edit mode.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Somebody we know?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nothing special in the call records department. They are available as a separate item in the main menu and also can be accessed by pressing the call (receiver) key on the touch pad. In fact pressing the call key takes you to the general list of all dialed, received and missed calls. It has a capacity of 20 numbers. If you wish to see the separate registers you have to go to the abovementioned Call Register menu item. The GPRS data counter is also available in the Call Register menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Call register menu</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Typing with style(s)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone supports the sending and receiving of SMS, EMS, MMS and email messages. Generally speaking, the LG messaging machine managed to surprise us with a few nice features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports the POP3 and SMTP protocols and as regards sending and receiving text emails it successfully does it job as we managed to found out during the test period. As regards emails with file attachments it poses rather strict limitations. The maximum size for one sent message is 300 KB along with the attachments, and the maximum size for one received message is 100 KB. In case you have received message with more than 5 attachments, only 5 of them will be received. For each e-mail account you may save up to 50 messages (totally 150 for three accounts), while in the Inbox you can store up to 30 messages for each account. The other 20 slots are reserved for the Drafts and Outbox folders. A good thing is that there is an option to provide a separate username and password for the SMTP server.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Retrieving emails ? Reading an email</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you start a new message you are given the option of choosing among a text message, multimedia message and an email message. If you choose the text type further on you could easily change it by just attaching multimedia content to it and thus turn it into an EMS or MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Messages menu ? Starting a new message </paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone supports EMS release 5, so is capable of sending color pictures, sounds, text styles, etc. The message typing is assisted by T9. A thing we noticed is that in order to type a number in your message you need to change to numeric mode (123) and then when you are done, go back to the text mode (abc). That's really bugging if you have to enter frequently numbers in your messages. It would have been nicer if one could enter numbers by long press of the respective keys which is a standard feature in almost all contemporary phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One nice feature is that if you have started a new message and all of a sudden you have to cancel its typing, it's saved automatically as a draft and next time you decide to start a new message the phone not only stores it for you but offers you to continue it from where you left it last time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Previous draft readily available</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice feature is that the phone keeps a record of the last numbers you have sent messages to and when sending a new one you can choose among them instead of digging down in the full phonebook list. It's a feature we would like to see in more phones nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Recent recipients list is a favorite feature</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several interesting options here allows for typing of color highlighted text. Furthermore there are three available input text sizes as well as options for formatting the text in Italics, Bold, Underline, Strikethrough styles? You could also align the text in the left, right or center portion of the screen. Receiving that kind of formatted text depends on the EMS version support of the recipient's mobile device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Typing a message ? Text formatting options</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File browsing and listening to music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The lack of memory card slot, an airplane mode, and playlist support clearly shows that this phone is not meant to be a music player. But don't get us wrong - that's not necessarily a bad thing. As we said in the beginning the phone should be reviewed in its own right having in mind its marketing specifics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The File manager appears as a My stuff item in the main menu. It includes separate factory preset folders for different multimedia content. In fact these folders are the only one you will see since the file manager doesn't actually support user-created folders. There also aren't any options for marking, copying or moving files among the folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> My Stuff menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally speaking, the file browser provides basic functionality and is not really that user-friendly. In order to view picture files you should open and close them one by one. There is no thumbnail view and there is no zoom or fullscreen mode for detailed preview of the pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Browsing through stored images</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file browser offers a dedicated Text folder where you can save .txt files and read them later. The text reader is also mediocre. Otherwise, the maximum size of a .txt file you can open is 460 KB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Using the .txt files reader</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MP3 player, the camera application, and the Photos album are kept into a dedicated Multimedia menu which can be started with the external camera/mp3 player shortcut key. Now, the Photo album is an interesting addition to the file manager and in a way makes up for its mediocre capabilities. It is organized as a picture gallery, allows for advancing to the next photo by pressing the navigation keys and supports thumbnail view. Zooming is again not present here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Browsing the photo album: single and multi view</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MP3 player is again on a mediocre level but we don't want you to get fed up with us saying that. We tried to make it clear form the very beginning that this phone is no multimedia device and also the fact that what it lacks in functionality it easily makes up for in sheer style and design. So it's back to the player? The player doesn't support playlists and it plays all the files you have saved in the MP3 folder. The supported file formats are MP3, AAC, AAC+, AAC++, WMA, MP4 (audio), and WAV. The AAC support is a good thing since AAC files tend to be smaller in size than MP3. The problem is that it doesn't read ID3 tags and the tracks in the file list are arranged by the respective file names - ordering by either artist or song name is impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The one and only playlist ? Playmode options</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the MP3 player has only 5 volume levels besides MUTE which is insufficient. The player cannot work in the background. It has three different animated visualizations which have nothing to do with the music beat itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Dummy graphic music visualizations</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you receive a call while the MP3 player is playing the song gets stopped and when you end your call it starts playing from the very beginning. There are several equalizer presets that you can use in order to enhance the player sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A steady hand does miracles<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camera has a 1.3 megapixel matrix and offers resolutions of up to 1280x960 pixels. The camera application itself is rather slow and it takes above 10 seconds in order to fire it up, take a shot at the maximum resolution and save it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Using the display as a camera viewfinder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a LED flash which is there to help you in poor light conditions. Speaking of poor light conditions, the camera has a night mode which does it job very well and compared to night modes in similar cameras produces relatively low photo noise. It offers 4x digital zoom which is not available at the maximum resolution though but this is not that great of a loss since it produces a mere crop &amp; resize of the original image. The camera menu offers option such as picture resolution, brightness level, the white balance that has several presets according to the available light conditions, and some color effects such as sepia, black &amp; white, negative, etc. The camera has some interesting shoot modes besides the regular still shot and those are Multi shoot mode and Frame mode. Multi shots are only available when the pixel resolution is set to 320 x 240 or 640 x 480, while the Frame shots are only available with the pixel resolution set to 176 x 220 which is the display resolution in fact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>      Various camera settings</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise the picture quality is fine if you managed to hold the phone perfectly still during image capturing. As we already said, the camera is awfully slow. There is a delay between the press of the button and the actual capturing of the photo. That means that most of the time the composition you want to take a shot at has already changed when the actual photographing takes place. Generally, you are could be easily misled by the long time it takes the camera to make the picture and deciding that it should have already taken the picture you could move a bit. That way you would turn the picture into an unrecognizable blur.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An interesting thing is that the camera view finder, similar to that of Samsung D600 we should add, doesn't display the full picture that the camera actually takes. In a way the viewfinder somewhat zooms the image and the left and right sides of the picture are cut outside the viewable area. You can only see the whole picture after you take it and save it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally speaking the camera is not very user friendly and its usability suffers from the shutter lag and the cropped image view finder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>                LG KG800 Chocolate sample photos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Two low light samples ? well lit scene vs. using flash in complete darkness</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera also captures video in maximum resolution of 176 x 144 pixels and the output format is the usual .3gp. The menu of the video camera is pretty much the same as the one we already described for the still camera with few exceptions. It offers both limited and unlimited recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Video samples</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>USB driving license<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone features full USB support and the LG USB cable comes along in the retail box along with the phone itself. The great thing about the USB support of the phone is that when connected it appears in the Windows explorer as a removable drive just as your regular USB flash drive would and no drivers are needed. If you receive a call whilst in mass storage mode, the call will be rejected but after you disconnect the handset, you will see the information about any missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Standby display while in USB drive mode</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the Removable drive allows you access to the Music, Photos, Videos, Text and Others folders. The Others folder is used for general file storage. You can upload any kind of files here - images, audio, or even files not specifically supported by the phone when you just want to carry them with you and download them later to another PC. Once again when saving content to the phone don't create subfolders since those won't be recognized and read by the phone file system. Interesting enough, the Photos folder is reserved for the pictures taken using the phone's camera and the access to it should be used only to transfer the pictures taken from the phone to the PC. Even though photos may be uploaded to this folder from the PC, they will not be available on the phone's photo album or Photos folder even if those pictures are the same ones you downloaded a minute ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you need any other type of synchronization between the phone and the PC like for items such as the phonebook and the schedule you should use the dedicated LG software LGPCSync that comes on CD along with the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Who needs mobile Internet?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As much as connectivity is concerned, the phone features 3-band GSM 900/1800/1900 and GPRS support for fast data transfers. It also features Bluetooth with the following profiles: Headset, Handsfree Kit, File Transfer, Image printing, Dial-up networking, Business card transfer, Browsing other devices, and Serial port profile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated WAP browser doesn't have full HTML support and managed to open only simple HTML pages such as Google. It's a regular WAP browser used in older phones and its presence here makes us think that again the sell point of the LG Chocolate phone definitely won't be its multimedia or connectivity capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    The clumsy browser</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Dating made simpler<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides the Contacts item which we already told you that it's strangely fitted here, the Organizer menu features the Calendar and the text Memos items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar is pretty straightforward - it offers a monthly view for navigation among the dates. Once you find the date you need, simply enter it and add an event. The first day of the week according to the calendar is Sunday - something that's not that common around whole Europe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Adding a task to the calendar</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The text Memos allow for storing some notes. Each note can have a maximum of 80 characters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Adding a text memo - better don't forget this one</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Tools menu also stores some useful applications, though they seem rather standard nowadays. There are the Alarm clock, the Calculator, the Unit converter, the World time clock, and the Voice recorder. The Alarms menu allows for the setting of 5 different alarms which could be repeated Mon-Fri, Mon-Sat or Everyday.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Alarm menu</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator offers rich scientific functions which are pretty redundant having in mind the mediocre technical capabilities of the rest of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The overcomplicated calculator</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Unit Converter also has a nice list of units such as Currency, Are, Length, Weight, Temperature, Volume, Velocity, and Shoes &amp; Clothes (both very interesting ones).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Unit converter application ? Converting shoes and clothes numbers</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder application has a 20 seconds limit and what is more the microphone is so insensitive that the application is nearly unusable unless directly spoken to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> The 20 sec voice recorder</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here we also find the setting for the Favorites menu which we spoke of earlier - the one with user-defined shortcuts which you invoke in standby by pressing the UP key on the touchpad.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Playing with numbers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phone we tested had only one preinstalled game and it was SUDOKU Puzzle. It's a logical puzzle game and it features a lot of numbers. Thus it didn't manage to become our team's favorite but we know it's a popular game so we can't say anything against it. Generally speaking, the game is amusing if you take the time to read the rules carefully. If you are into games of logic, it seems as a pleasurable pastime.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Well, there's not much more to say really. It sports a great design and in some internet forums they even call it "the RAZR killer". As far as our opinion goes, we have rarely seen so beautifully designed mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't say anything substantially bad about it, because it's just not expected to amaze in functionality, but in design and style. The only exception is the awkward phonebook which we think should be well developed even in phones that are not business-orientated. It should be more developed in the line of user friendliness because it's not only the sheer capacity that counts after all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally speaking, the phone has claims of being capable of a whole lot of stuff and indeed, we proved that it is capable of them but pitifully, it manages to perform them on the level of a poor student working on a mid-term paper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But after all is said and done, who are you going to take with you at the next fashion party thrown back downtown? Or maybe not who but what? Our guess is that it will be the LG Chocolate phone because classy company always counts in your favor.</paragraph>
