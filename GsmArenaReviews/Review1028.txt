			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung is trying really hard to not leave an empty spot in the mobile market, so the Galaxy Note 8.0 announcement shouldn't be a surprise. The compact tablet follows the same design guidelines as all the other Samsung high-end devices announced in the last year or so and has set its sights on the Apple iPad Mini.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung has given the Galaxy Note 8.0 an S Pen and the slew of Touch Wiz-exclusive software features to help it in its battles. Driving them is the company's Exynos 4 Quad 4412 chipset with four 1.6GHz Cortex-A9 CPUs, Mali 400MP4 GPU and 2GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick view of the Galaxy Note 8.0 features list.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 at a glance:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sounds familiar, doesn't it? The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 is little more than an upsized Galaxy Note II. Or is that a downsized Galaxy Note 10.1? The only differences are the new S-Pen software features that come with Android 4.1.2 and the latest TouchWiz, but those have already been made available to the Note 8.0 predecessors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is of the TFT PLS variety and the resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels sounds like last season's stuff. This results in 189 pixels per inch, which may not sound like match, but it's still more than the iPad Mini's 162 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the camera, it's a 5MP sensor capable of shooting 1080p videos @ 30fps, coupled with an LED flash. Join us on the next page to learn more about the hardware features of the Galaxy Note 8.0, a compact tablet which can make phone calls.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Samsung took no chances with the design of the Galaxy Note 8.0, sticking to the styling of the Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II. The finish of the portable slate is very similar to that of the company's flagship smartphone, too. Now, that may not sound too bad at first, but the design is really starting to wear off at this point, so we really wish Samsung went in a different direction this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rather peculiarly, just like the Galaxy S III and the Note II, the Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet supports native phone calls (or at least as far as the 3G/4G version is concerned). It features a micro-SIM compartment as well as a microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 338 grams, the Note 8.0 feels reasonably light in hand, but it's still a bit heavier than the iPad Mini. Whether or not the extra heft is worth it depends on your need for an S Pen and the Wacom digitizer that comes with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mentioning the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0's display, we have to admit we hoped to see a Super AMOLED panel, so the regular TFT PLS unit left us a bit disappointed. It still gets the job done, but with its only average contrast and unspectacular ppi, it's not what you would call a premium screen. And Samsung reps at the booth would really go out of their way to convince us that the Galaxy Note 8.0 is, in fact, a premium device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 4.1.2 is in the driver's seat, which of course means the Note 8.0 benefits from Project Butter. The latest version of the TouchWiz UI, known as Nature UX, is also in tow and comes with the latest bells and whistles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of them is a cool settings feature to fine-tune the screen brightness in auto brightness mode, by defining an offset (+/-1, +/-2 etc, which mean the Note 8.0 will always select a brightness setting higher/lower than it feels appropriate).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a special reading mode too, which automatically adjusts the display for reading. The feature is only supported by a handful of apps so far, but the good news is the default ebook reader is among them. The end result should be a better experience for those long reads you do on your tablet. Sounds nice on paper, but we will need to spend more time with the Note 8.0 to be convinced of the actual worth of this feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As this is TouchWiz on Jeally Bean, we also found some of the usual Samsung-exclusive features like Smart Stay, Multi-Window mode for enhanced mutli-tasking, Air View functionality as well as Popup Play mode. AllShare Play and Cast are also present.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the S Pen to be as useful as ever and is irreplaceable for selecting, highlighting and editing text and images. It's also capable of performing the same tricks as on the Note 10.1 when you press the button found on its side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, there's also an IR blaster waiting for you to aim it at a TV and start using it as an 8" remote control. This isn't the most exciting of concepts, but the nicely designed app was keen to prove us wrong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, we couldn't take the 5MP camera for a spin and see if it's any good, but we'll try to fix that in the coming days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the tablet sits a 4.600mAh battery (non-removable, of course). Don't expect it to last a lifetime, but it's not too shabby for a device of this size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hold on tight onto the next page, where you'll find our hands-on video detailing the features of the Galaxy Note 8.0.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We shot a video, which gives you a quick tour of the hardware of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0. After that we got to take the Exynos 4412-driven TouchWizified Android 4.1.2 UI for a spin. The slate turned out pretty smooth, even though it's not even finalized yet. Check out how it did below.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 is powered by the company's own 2012-launched Exynos 4 Quad chipset with four Cortex A9 CPUs inside it. As such, it's not at all the last word in mobile processors, but still we've given it the heavy task of going through our array of benchmarks.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Exynos 4 Quad gets out of breath in Linpack as well and is bluntly outrun by the Snapdragon S4 Pro chipsets and the Cortex-A15s inside them.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>In the compound benchmarks AnTuTu and Quadrant the Galaxy Note 8.0 ranks suprisingly high beating the similarly spec'd Note II.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The overall results from our benchmark extravaganza with the Galaxy Note 8.0 should come as no surprise to anyone. After all, the device is sporting last year's tech inside it, and can't measure to its more powerful rivals. Despite all of this, the chipset is by no means a slouge and can pull a lot of software weight behind it without breaking too much sweat.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung Note tablets feel quite at home in Barcelona. Last year the company tried to steal the spotlight with the Galaxy Note 10.1 and it's now the smaller version's turn to try its hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 8.0 sits comfortably between the large Galaxy Note 10.1 and the more pocket-friendly Galaxy Note II. It seems to get the best from both worlds - an earpiece and a microphone from the Note II and the slightly higher resolution and more comfortable S Pen from the Galaxy Note 10.1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 is also a stylish slate, although we have to admit we are starting to get bored with the design. The good news is the tablet is light, reasonably easy to handle and packs a display, which may not be the best we've seen, is more than reasonable for its class. The Mali-400MP4 GPU is certainly capable of handling higher resolution though, and it's a pity Samsung didn't take that chance to gain an even bigger advantage over its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Undoubtedly, the array of software features is a key selling point, but save for the special reading mode, they have all been around for quite some time, so they won't make many Samsung users consider an upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some will probably find Samsung's latest tablet interesting, but we're not convinced many people will favor it over the Galaxy Note II. Yes, the Galaxy Note 8.0 has more than twice the screen surface, but that's just about all it puts to the table. There's no resolution upgrade to maintain the pixel density and pocketability is certainly worse than it is on the 5.5" phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand, those that need the S Pen functionality and find the larger screens more productive will certainly prefer the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. Unless the pricing (which Samsung stubbornly refuses to disclose) is a nice surprise, the Galaxy Note 8.0 might find it hard to carve a niche for itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 N8000 ? Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Samsung will have to try and deliver the Galaxy Note 8.0 to the market at a price point close to that of the Apple iPad Mini. While the compact iOS slate has a headstart, the Galaxy Note 8.0 won't be doomed in this battle as it offers a more feature-rich platform, and the extra benefit of the S-Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With its all plastic build, the Galaxy Note 8.0 doesn't hold a candle to the aluminum-clad iPad Mini, but it offers a display of higher pixel density and a more usable screen aspect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll know more about the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 over the coming months as the tablet gets ready to hit markets around the globe. The compact Nature UX tablet certainly has otential, but it's still in for a tough ride and if Samsung are to make it a success, they have to play their marketing and pricing cards right.</paragraph>
