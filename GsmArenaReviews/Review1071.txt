		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's the next-generation Nexus and this time LG has the privilege. And when Google goes "My pleasure!", they most likely mean it. The Nexus 4 aggressively undercuts competitors' pricing as it sets out to wipe the floor with most of them in terms of speed and performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At only $300 SIM-free (when most flagships charge $200 on a 2-year contract), the Nexus 4 flaunts a 4.7" WXGA IPS display and the most powerful chipset in an Android phone at the moment. It has of course the latest Android OS and it will be the first in line to get the new ones as they come in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are after an Android smartphone, it's hard to find reasons not to buy a Nexus 4, but some nagging doubts linger after the LG Optimus G review, where not everything turned out all roses and sunshine. Having spent some time with the Nexus, here's what we think are the headline features and what could've been better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two biggest complaints since the LG Nexus 4 was announced have been the limited storage and the lack of LTE. But even those things can be overlooked as LTE networks outside the US are just getting started and unless you play a lot of 3D games or have a huge music collection, 16GB should be adequate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the Nexus 4 looks certain to unsettle the competition. If it's available through the Google Play Store in your country, it's practically cheap enough to buy on a whim. With no contracts to worry about, we think there will be plenty of fresh Android converts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And that's the main goal of the Nexus line - encourage people to use Google's services. Once you're in, you can buy music, TV shows, movies, books, magazines, get cloud storage and documents, even buy stuff in the real world with Google Wallet. The limited inbuilt storage begins to be less of an issue if you use Google Music and Google Drive, you don't need to store all that much locally.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 is based on the LG Optimus G, so expect there to be a lot of similarities between the two phones but it also shares DNA with the previous Nexus phone. Jump to the next page to see if it has its mom's eyes or its dad's chin.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Nexus 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail box of the Nexus 4 is barely bigger than the handsets itself. It packs a charger and USB cable, a SIM eject tool and a Quick start guide. That's it - as you've probably noticed, there's no headset included in the box (even though there's more than enough room). Again, this is a 300 bucks handset, plus you probably have a headset lying around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG Nexus 4 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 133.9 x 68.7 x 9.1 mm, the LG Nexus 4 is nearly the same size as the Optimus G, though it's a couple of millimeters taller and 0.6mm thicker. It weighs virtually the same too - 139g vs. 145g. The Samsung Galaxy Nexus is about the same size as well - 135.5 x 67.9 x 8.9 mm, 135g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The looks of the Nexus 4 are a crossover between those of the Galaxy Nexus (the front) and the Optimus G (the back). The top and bottom sides are curved unlike the rectangular design of the Optimus, which accounts for it being taller and it maintains the Nexus look from the previous phone. The phone is flat on both sides, which is great news for people who weren't fans of the humpback design of the Galaxy Nexus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Nexus 4 is almost featureless when the display is off. This contrasts with the back, which has the same glass coating and a curious 3D-like pattern as the Optimus G. By the way, both the front and the back of the LG Nexus 4 are covered in Gorilla Glass 2, which should ensure enough protection against scratches.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front glass is curved at the edges, which is great as swipes starting from the edge of the screen are important (e.g. swiping through the pages of the lockscreen). This is somewhat similar to the design of the Nokia N9 and we like it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back feels a lot less like the iPhone 4/4S and more like Samsung's hyperglazed coating, meaning more like plastic than real glass. The Nexus 4 has similar finish to the LG Optimus G - the glass is polarized, the pattern shifts depending on viewing angle and lighting, causing the illusion of a 3D pattern. The effect is more prominent on a black handset than on a white one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going back to the front side of the new Nexus 4, it is occupied by the huge 4.7-inch display of WXGA resolution. We'll take a closer look at the display in the next chapter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Between the two sheets of Gorilla Glass 2 on the front and back there's double framing - recognizable by a plastic and a metal strip that run around the sides of the phone. The metallic strip is even visible when looking the handset dead on and is one of the few design accents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here's how it looks through our microscope:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen we find the earpiece, a couple of hidden sensors and the 1.3MP video-call camera. Below the display there's only a notification LED in the middle. It may look a bit like a key, but it isn't - the Nexus 4 uses on-screen buttons, unlike the Optimus G. The notification light's position is the same as on the Galaxy Nexus, making the two look even more alike. The LED pulses to alert of emails, missed calls and Facebook events. There's no dedicated setting for it, other than an On/Off toggle, but several third-party apps in the Play Store will let you fine-tune the LED's behavior.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the phone features the microSIM compartment (you'll need the SIM eject tool to open it) and the volume rocker. The right side has just the Power/Lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack, along with the secondary mic, are on top. The bottom hosts the TV-out-supporting microUSB port and the primary mic. There are a couple of screws that secure the back as well. Keep in mind though that the Nexus 4 uses the SlumPort technology as opposed to MHL, so any adapters you might currently have are incompatible with them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the glass-covered back, but haven't covered yet the most important things there, the 8MP camera and LED flash. Both the lens and the flash are flush with the surface and there's nothing protruding like on the Optimus G. Unlike the Galaxy Nexus, the camera on the LG Nexus 4 is more traditionally positioned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just below the camera lens is the Nexus logo (to let everyone know the Holo UI is the real deal, not some third-party skin that looks like it) and further down is the LG logo, next to the loudspeaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under the back cover is a 2100mAh Li-Po battery, developed by LG Chem and promising increased lifespan of 800 charge cycles. The cover itself is non-removable - that is to say, not designed to be user removable, but it can probably give in if you undo the screws - though it would be still impossible to stick a spare battery in there. There's no microSD card slot either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Official battery life quotes promise 390 hours of standby and 15 hours of talk time on a 3G network. The Optimus G delivered on the talk time and we expect the Nexus 4 will too (we'll update this review as soon as our battery tests are done), but the Optimus was nothing spectacular when it came to web browsing or watching videos. We'll see if running stock Android 4.2 makes a difference to a custom skin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We should also mention that the Nexus 4 supports wireless charging. It uses the Qi (pronounced chee) standard so any charger will work - there's a Nexus-branded Wireless Charging Orb, which looks really cool but isn't available yet. Nokia's Lumia phones use the same wireless charging standard, so their accessories will work too - really, just google Qi charger and you'll find plenty of options.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Nexus 4 features a 4.7" True HD-IPS+ LCD screen of 768 x 1280 resolution and 608 nits of brightness. There's about 8% more screen real estate than on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, the extra surface mostly due to the display being wider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the pixel density is virtually the same - just under 320ppi - the display on the Nexus 4 is actually sharper due to its RGB matrix, compared to its predecessor and its PenTile Super AMOLED display. Things become clearer once we have both under a microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG uses a screen technology called Zerogap touch - it's basically a laminated screen so there's no air between the screen layers (which causes glare) and it uses in-cell touch technology. The top layer is Gorilla Glass 2 for protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the LG Nexus 4 through our usual display tests and here's how it scored. You can find more about the testing procedures here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LCD is noticeably brighter than the Galaxy Nexus Super AMOLED screen and even the new Samsung Galaxy S III, though not quite as bright as the HTC One X. The black levels are not that deep though, especially when looking the screen at an angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sadly, the high reflectivity of the Nexus 4 screen leads to a rather mediocre sunlight performance. The Nexus 4 screen is slightly more reflective than that of the Optimus G, possibly due to the different glass. There's only a slight improvement here over the Optimus 4X HD's display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles are good thanks to the IPS+ tech, but not without some color and contrast loss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The software that handles the drawing to the screen is noticeably different between the Optimus G and the Nexus 4. On the Optimus, images get their saturation boosted and are sharpened. The result is more visible detail than on the Nexus. The color balance is also different and it seemed to us that it's more accurate on the Optimus G. We compared images both with the native gallery and the Chrome browser, and the results were the same (so it's not LG's custom gallery enhancing the images).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Nexus 4 is about the same size as the other Android flagships and offers solid build quality. We do worry a bit that the glass on the back might crack if you drop the phone, though it should be much easier to replace than the front glass, even if the back cover isn't technically user-removable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Drops aside, the double Gorilla Glass protection that the phone enjoys should keep scratches to a minimum (though we actually managed to get ours scratched). The feel of the material isn't up to par with some metal and polycarbonate unibodies but it's way better than the plasticky Galaxy Nexus. We're talking about a $300 phone after all and it does have a more premium feel than its price tag suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thin bezel on the left and right of the screen make the phone relatively narrow (especially when you consider it's a 15:9 screen vs. the 16:9 screens of the Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy S III and One X). The handset feels good in the hand, though we would have liked more tapered edges.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Every new member of the Nexus family runs an updated Android version and the Nexus 4 is no exception. It has the latest Android release, 4.2 Jelly Bean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, it sounds like a routine .1 upgrade to the Jelly Bean we know, but there're quite a few new features added. We'll go over them in full in the following pages, but the Google Nexus 4 hands-on video below offers a glimpse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen in Android 4.2 Jelly Bean features the same large dotted circle around the center-placed padlock button. But that's where the similarities to Android 4.1 end. Enter lockscreen widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are full-screen, resizable tiles, one of which is always visible at the top of the main lockscreen, above the padlock icon. The rest are a swipe to the right away. The one on the main lockscreen is collapsed to make room for the padlock button, but can be expanded to display additional information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As this is a brand new feature to Android, custom widgets are hard to come by, so you are left with just a limited selection of few stock ones: Messages, Calendar, Gmail and Digital Clock. The camera shortcut, previously located at nine o'clock on the unlock circle is now a stand-alone widget, a swipe to the left away from the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lockscreen widgets are resizable - tap and drag down to expand and show more content, if available. Lockscreen widgets can also be reordered by tapping and dragging, so you can choose which one is visible on the main lockscreen. They can also be dragged up to discard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are multiple unlock patterns to choose from: simple slide, pattern, pin or password, and face unlock. The lockscreen could even be skipped altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once unlocked, you're welcomed with the familiar homescreen interface introduced in Ice Cream Sandwich. The bottom of the screen is reserved for the three navigation controls: Back, Home and Recent Apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the on-screen controls, you get the customizable shortcut dock - two shortcut icons on either side of the app drawer key. You can have folders there, each with multiple shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Android 4.2 Jelly Bean isn't just business and no play. Google has integrated a little feature called Daydream, which is simply a sort of a screensaver. Once turned on, you can set it up to show photo albums or the latest news from Google Currents when the device is either docked or idle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification center has been slightly revamped. Quick toggles have been added, accessible via an icon in the top right corner of the notification area. You get access to key device settings such as brightness, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Battery. They aren't actual toggles, but only quick access shortcuts to their respective panels in the Settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Currently, only the Brightness can be adjusted on the fly, without paying the Settings menu a visit. The quick settings menu can be accessed by a two-finger swipe down from the top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has added a bit of personalization to the Quick Toggle panel in the notification area. Your name and photo are displayed but only after you've logged in to Google+.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications can be expanded and collapsed with a two-finger swipe, and the top one is expanded by default (if the app that put up the notification supports it, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The homescreen consists of five panes, none to be added or removed, to fill with shortcuts, folders and widgets. More often than not, the latter are resizable in all directions in order to fit any tight space. To resize a widget, you tap and hold and then release. Four handles will appear on its sides, allowing you to change the widget's size in the direction you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Folders haven't been changed since Ice Cream Sandwich and function as you'd expect. A folder is created by dropping a shortcut on top of another and can be named by tapping on the "Unnamed folder" label. Opening a folder expands it only as much as needed to fit the icons inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The folders themselves are circular with the shortcuts inside drawn as if they are in a line one behind the other and you're looking at them at an angle (complete with perspective). They are lined up so the first shortcut in the folder will be the only one unobscured - the rest of the icons are nearly impossible to tell apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer of the Nexus 4 consists of 5 rows of icons, instead of the usual four. It features two tabs - Apps and Widgets, each with side-scrollable pages. If you scroll past the available apps you move into the Widgets tab. There's also a Market shortcut next to the tabs, for quicker access to Android's app repository.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps and widgets are ordered alphabetically and there's no other sorting option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Placing a shortcut or widget on the homescreen works as you would expect: press and hold to grab it and then position it on the homescreen pane of choice. Two more options appear at the top of the screen while you're dragging - Uninstall (to quickly remove apps) and App info, which opens the application's entry in the Manage applications list. Drop the app or widget on either one to activate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least, the Recent Apps list has remained virtually unchanged, save for some optimizations in load time and a few neat animations here and there. It all adds up as a really polished user experience and feels fantastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's where Google's Project Butter comes into play. We've covered it already, but it's generally Google's way of getting the Android user interface rid of stutter and lags. Essentially, Jelly Bean runs at 60 frames per second where the hardware allows it. Since software engineers didn't stop there, they also added triple buffering (CPU, GPU and display working in parallel, not waiting in turns).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a whole, Android 4.2 Jelly Bean offers a polished and smooth user interface. The OS is getting closer to offering a lot of the features that skins like Sense 4+, Nature UX and Optimus UI have been having for a while now, and it's interesting to see Google's spin on them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, the Android 4.2 tweaks don't end here. Follow us as we continue to explore. Next up, Google Now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now shows what virtual assistants should be like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now was first introduced back in Jelly Bean 4.1 and is definitely one of the most interesting additions in the OS. Simply put, it's Google's version of a personal assistant. Google Now is in the same neck of the woods as Apple's Siri, but it learns constantly from your daily routines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's accessed by swiping up any of the three persistent navigation buttons at the bottom and gives you short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, so it offers you a re-route.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Jelly Bean 4.2, Google Now has become even smarter and, if you allow it, can scan your email for upcoming flights, deliveries or restaurant reservations and let you know when they are due. There are also numerous kinds of cards like birthdays (yours and those of your contacts) and what distance you've walked in a particular month. The last one could definitely feel creepy for some users, but it's easily turned off from the Google Now settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has also integrated Voice Actions. They can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One big advantage of Google's Jelly Bean is that the voice typing functionality doesn't require an internet connection to work. You can enter text by speaking anywhere you can use the on-screen keyboard - be it the Messaging app or a note taking app - without the need for a data connection as long as you have pre-downloaded the needed language packs (and those only take about 20-25MB of your storage per pack).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Making voice typing available offline also made it faster as it's not dependent on your connection. What's even more impressive is that the transition hasn't cost it anything in terms of accuracy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 is based on the LG Optimus G and as a result features the same monster quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor. Each of the four Krait cores is clocked at 1.5GHz and considering the 2GB of RAM and the Adreno 320 GPU, the Nexus 4 should easily ace our usual array of benchmark performance tests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've performed a battery of benchmarks on the Nexus 4 and pitted it against some of the top smartphones currently available on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up was BenchmarkPi, which tests the calculative performance of the individual processor cores. Surprisingly, the Nexus 4 posted a pretty shocking time here, ranking last. We can only assume that it's some issue that the benchmark itself has with Jelly Bean 4.2 as the Optimus G comes on top.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack gives the multi-threaded performance of the S4 Pro CPU a run for its money. The Nexus 4 once again failed to match the performance of the Optimus G and was even beaten by the Galaxy Note II.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is an all-round benchmark and here, the Google Nexus 4 excelled, taking the top spot. We don't know if that's just a coincidence or not, but AnTuTu is the only app to get an update after Jelly Bean 4.2 was released. Perhaps it was simply the only one that was optimized for the the latest Android version.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things weren't as rosy in Quadrant, which is another all-round performance test. The Nexus 4 got pitiful 4 thousand points, which isn't as good as one might hope for with this kind of raw power.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is an array of GPU-stressing benchmarks, in which the Nexus 4 got on to a flying start. GLBenchmark Egypt off-screen tests show the GPU's RAW power while ignoring the screen reolution. The Nexus 4's Adreno 320 got a good 26 fps, slightly beating the Mali GPU's inside the Galaxy S III and Note II. The result was once again lower than that of the Optimus G, but that's easier to explain - Jelly Bean and its Project Butter is more taxing on the GPU than ICS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We used SunSpider, BrowserMark and Vellamo to examine browsing performance. The Google Nexus 4 scores brought more confusion here, as the smartphone was always well off the pace of the Optimus G and on two of the three occasions came last. Confusion, because the smartphone's Chrome browser is actually pretty quick and we didn't notice it to be worse than any of its competitors, let alone by that kind of margin.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BrowserMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while this is the first time in a while now when a Google Nexus stands at the top of the Android mountain hardware-wise, the Nexus 4 didn't really turn out to be the benchmark champion that we expected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It could be a driver issue as Google didn't have all that long to optimize the chipset for the Jelly Bean 4.2 platform or a matter of the benchmark developers optimizing their software for the new Android release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the real-life experience is anything to go by, it's more a case of the latter as the Google Nexus 4 is a blazing fast smartphone. Hold-ups were absent throughout the interface and there was no lag to speak of either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did notice thought that the Nexus 4 tends to get somewhat hot when used continuously, though. There are many reports on the web on the smartphone reducing its performance when it reaches a certain temperature and we are still running some tests to find out more about it. We'll publish our findings on this page in the following few days.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Phonebook is the stock Android app, which hasn't been changed since its major redesign last year with the introduction of Ice Cream Sandwich.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's made up of three tabs that you can switch between with sideways swipes. The middle tab is the default one, listing all of your contacts. Contacts are listed with a name and a picture to the right. They can be sorted by first or last name, and viewed as first name or last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent scroll bar available that you can grab and jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's regular search as you type too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quick contacts feature triggers on tapping a contact image to bring up a tabbed popup window. The tabs are phone and email with a list of the available numbers or addresses. These tabs can be navigated with sideways swipes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single contact view displays the contact's name along with a star to favorite a contact and a Settings button that lets you edit, share or delete a contact, as well assign custom ringtones to them or set the phone to redirect calls from that contact straight to voice mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Under that is a list of all contact info sorted by category - phone numbers, emails, events, notes and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more info for the contact. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts that the phonebook displays can be filtered by service (e.g. hide all Facebook contacts) and even group (so you can hide all contacts that don't belong in a group, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other two major tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is readily thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In-call quality was good and reasonably loud but it tends to plummet in areas of spotty coverage. The Google Nexus 4 has a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation, so noisier environments didn't prove to be much of an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer features the new neon-blue on black theme, but hasn't grown any new functionality. There's still no smart dialing, which is a real shame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer is just the first tab of the phone app, the other two being the Call log and the Favorites tab (you get the same in the Phonebook). In the Call log, you can't delete individual entries, which was mildly annoying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Google Nexus 4. It scored a Good overall mark which means you might consider enabling vibration in noisier environments. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual but with some improvements. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - each thread consists of all messages between you and one of your contacts. A cool new feature is that you can select multiple threads to mass delete them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each thread is organized like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick contacts work here too and there's a call shortcut at the top of the screen when viewing a thread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the Nexus 4 to delete older messages (by default, it keeps 500 texts and 50 MMS). You can activate delivery reports and read reports too (they are notifications that the receiver has read the message).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a text is still frustrating as the text box starts off as a single line and grows only up to three lines, which makes working with longer texts hard. We mostly let it slide on previous versions, but with a 4.7" screen there's no excuse not to make the text box bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving onto email, the Gmail app has grown handy shortcuts at the bottom of the screen but is mostly unchanged. It supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted. The default app supports multiple Gmail accounts, but there's no unified inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool new feature in Gmail is that you can swipe left or right to move between messages in your inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcuts on the bottom of the screen are new email, search, labels, refresh and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The keyboard has now even more room to stretch its legs on the 4.7" screen and typing is very easy. Keys get even bigger when you switch to landscape mode - the long screen becomes very comfortable for two-thumb typing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Jelly Bean 4.2 Google introduces a new typing method called Gesture typing. It works in a manner very similar to Swype -- you just Swipe your finger over the letters you want to type, lifting after each word is complete. Naturally, the Gesture Typing feature benefits from the already existing Android word prediction, so you can just click on the words the keyboard suggests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the text area will reveal a "handle" attached to the text cursor - it's easy and more accurate, which makes correcting mistakes easier. A double tap will bring up the select options - select word and select all - with two handles to adjust the start and end of the selection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If a word has a typo, it will be underlined in red and when you tap it, the phone will offer a number of suggested corrections along with options to add the word to the phone's dictionary or just delete the word.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Gallery in Android 4.2 Jelly Bean retains its ICS looks and functionality. The Default view of the gallery is Albums, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders with photos in the phone. Rather than the familiar stacks, the app uses a grid of photos, two on a line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides, Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), People (if the photos have tagged faces in them) and Tags (these are general tags you can add manually).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is the Make available offline feature - it lets you easily select multiple online albums and download them for offline viewing. The Gallery app supports online albums like Picasa (but not Facebook) and you can set it to sync photos only over Wi-Fi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to remind you you're at the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the single photo view is updated too - above the photo are several sharing shortcuts and a delete button, while below is a line of small thumbnails of all other photos in the album. You can tap those small thumbnails to move to other images or you can just swipe to the side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more option. The editor can be accessed from a small icon from the bottom left hand-side corner and offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the strength of the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app called Movie Studio handles editing videos and it's quite feature rich. You can add multiple videos to the timeline and trim their start and end points, you can add titles and effects (including transition effects) add music and there are multiple options available when you decide to export the video (resolution, quality, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an app that can completely eliminate the need for a computer for most people when creating videos. Plus Apple charges a good amount of money for the same functionality with their iMovie app. Same goes for the image editor too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Stock video player lacks DivX support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player is still not getting the necessary attention from Google and there's still no dedicated videos app (you have to go through the Gallery). Unlike the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which includes support for the the DivX and XviD codecs, the Nexus 4 fails to play them altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality is still very limited - you get play/pause and a slider to scrub through the video but that's it. Unfortunately, support for subtitles and .MKV files is also still missing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the Nexus 4 plays very well, however, are .MP4 files. It didn't think twice about playing either 720p or 1080p full HD videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Ultimately, you'd likely consider downloading one of the many free alternative video players on the Google Play Store to replace the lacking default video player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At long last, Google has implemented wirelessly sharing videos with a Wi-Fi enabled TV. The feature relies on the good ol' DLNA technology to connect and the Miracast protocol for streaming. It's another feature most customs launchers had, but is only now making its way to the platform itself.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Music Player is still far behind the competition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 comes with the latest stock Music app. It has the same side-scrollable tabs like much of the other stuff in Jelly Bean and comes with plenty of updates.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabs are used to organize your music library - there's Recent, Artists, Albums, Songs, Playlists and Genres.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Settings key you can get into the equalizer. It can be turned on and off and features several presets that along with a user defined one. If you plug in a headset, you can also play with the Bass boost and 3D effect sliders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several Shop for artist shortcuts sprinkled throughout the interface, which bring you to a Google search page with albums from the selected artist that you can buy from multiple online sellers. There's even an option to look for nearby stores that have the album if you want a hard copy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the player is working, the lockscreen features the album art and track info for the current song along with simple playback controls. The notification area also lets you control the playback via an expandable notification.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Clean audio output is on the quiet side<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 audio output is virtually identical to that of the LG Optimus G. Hardly shocking, given that most of the circuitry inside is identical, but still pretty good news.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The below average volume levels aside, the Nexus 4 results came out excellent in the first part of our test. When connected to an active external amplifier, the smartphone produces excellently clean output with no weak points whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even more impressively, stereo crosstalk is the only area of its performance to suffer noticeably when we plugged in a pair of headphones. On that occasion the Nexus 4 produced one of the cleanest outputs we have seen. The volume levels don?t drop, either, so they can qualify as average on this occasion.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixel camera disappoints<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 packs an 8 megapixel camera, producing still shots with a resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. There's a single LED flash underneath it, but don't count on it doing wonders in most low-light situations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface has been given a fresh coat of paint with an interface you'll either love or hate. With a simple tap and hold, a circle pops out giving you access to the various options. Once your finger is on a particular setting icon, it expands to reveal its options. Alternatively, you can invoke the settings circle by pressing the icon in the top right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can't help but compare it to the classic Android browser's lab feature for quick navigation, which we really liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera app lets you set the resolution, adjust the ISO, white balance and focus mode. You can also shoot HDR photos by tapping on the dedicated icon. On the right hand-side is a big blue button used for capturing. Beneath it is the camera/camcorder switch icon. From there you can choose to shoot panoramas and photo spheres, which we'll go in depth in just a second. Above the capture button is a shortcut to the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touch focus is available, too and works reasonably fast - just make sure you don't hold your finger for too long as the settings circle will appear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Android 4.0, Google introduced the Panorama capturing mode, and now with Android 4.2 Jelly Bean users will get a cool feature dubbed Photo Sphere. It's a panorama mode on steroids and allows you to capture photos in multiple directions (up, down, left, right).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is friendly and intuitive. It shows you dots which you have to aim the camera at, then rinse and repeat until you get a 360-degree Photo Sphere photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After they've been captured and saved as JPEG files you can view them and navigate around the whole image. You can share the image on Google+ or, if you feel like it, contribute the Photo Sphere to Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The feature itself was inspired by Street View, as the Product Management Director for Android Hugo Barra points out. He adds that the photos pack embedded XML metadata in them allowing you to easily share them on Google+ and put them in Google+ photo albums, where your friends can view them as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new interface lacks a shortcut to the Gallery app. That's because Google has replaced it with a gesture. Swiping to the right opens the Camera app's Filmstrip view. It gives you the ability to quickly discard any photos you've taken by swiping them up or down or just quickly glance at recent shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality of the 8 megapixel camera was rather disappointing. Shots came up pretty noisy and didn't really have a lot of fine detail. Colors were relatively accurate, but contrast wasn't always great.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go a few samples for you to check out - keep in mind that they weren't taken in the best lighting conditions, as the weather around the office hasn't been particularly favorable lately. You can normally get slightly better output, but as we said, you shouldn't really expect miracles.       Google Nexus 4 camera samples</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Naturally, Google Nexus 4 also entered our tool, which makes it a lot easier to compare its output to the other top of the line smartphones. The tool's page will give you information on what to watch out for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's quite obvious that the Nexus 4 doesn't have too great an advantage over the Galaxy Nexus, which wasn't that good to begin with, and comes some way off the Galaxy S III.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video capture is not that great either<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface of the Nexus 4 is almost the same as the still camera's - you get the same panel on the right and quick settings when you hold your finger over the viewfinder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are shot at 1080p and have a consistent 30fps framerate. The output is saved in MP4 files, having a bitrate of 12Mbps, which is rather low for high-quality 1080p capture. The good news is that they come with stereo sound with a sample rate of 48kHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality is okay but far from the best in class. The low bitrate leads to some compression artifacts, which eats into the already unimpressive amount of resolved detail. Notice how the grass behind the windmill on the left lacks any detail, while the bits on the other side look way better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors are a bit dull, too, and while the videos will easily do for less demanding users, they will hardly win the Nexus 4 any awards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The latest Android ace features a wide list of connectivity options. Starting off with the basics, the Google Nexus 4 packs a quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE and penta-band 3G. The latter is backed by HSPA (42Mbps downlink, 5.76Mbps uplink). LTE, sadly, isn't part of Nexus 4's connectivity list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi support covers a/b/g/n, with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz band compatibility. Wi-Fi Direct and DLNA are part of the package, of course. The Wi-Fi Direct is a technology, which enables devices to connect to each other without the need for a Wi-Fi hotspot. The beauty of it is that only one device has to be Wi-Fi Direct-ready for the magic to happen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using this technology two (or up to eight) devices can share files in a more advanced, fast and secure way, paving the road to an eventual Bluetooth demise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>NFC is also on board with support for Android Beam. With NFC you can share contacts, URLs, memos, messages, calendar events or even a call request to another NFC-enabled device or a tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 also comes with a built-in A-GPS receiver that can rely on a digital compass and a barometer too (this helps get faster GPS locks).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For wired connections, the Nexus 4 relies on its SlimPort - a DisplayPort based interface allowing you to connect a regular microUSB as well as HDMI cables (via an adapter). Thankfully, that's not the only options, because as we mentioned earlier, the Nexus 4 supports Miracast for wirelessly mirroring its display to an HDTV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major disappointment is the Nexus 4's lack of USB on-the-go connectivity. Sadly, it's not a software limitation, as it was on the Galaxy Nexus, but the hardware simply doesn't support it. You can connect keyboard, mice and any other input device through Bluetooth, but over USB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is in charge of web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nexus 4 comes with Google Chrome as a default web browser out of the box, replacing the generic Android browser. The interface hasn't changed since Chrome's launch for Android and is clean and minimalist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top there's an URL bar with a refresh/stop buttons next to tabs and settings buttons. You can switch between tabs with a wide swipe from either the left or right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Chrome is running on the WebKit rendering engine, so underneath the minimalist UI it's basically the same as all Android stock browsers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with its desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous on settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are out of Wi-Fi access, you can, for example, choose temporarily not to load images. Digging into Chrome's options, you'll also have the option to turn the auto-fill of forms and storing passwords on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, while Chrome excels in many areas, it falls short on the one that could be a deal-breaker for many of Android users and this is Flash. Sadly, viewing Flash content is the one thing you won't be able to do on the Nexus 4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 doesn't come with a dedicated file browser or a document editor. However, after installing a third-party file browser we were able to open all the different document types: DOC, XLS, PPT from Office 2003 and 2007 along with PDF with ease. It's unknown why Google hasn't given its own document editor a simple shortcut on the app drawer, or simply preloaded Google Drive in the first place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewer works pretty fast and there's handy Find functionality. There's no editing however, and no paid upgrades for that either (but there are plenty of alternatives in the Android Market anyway, so it's not as big an issue as it might seem at first).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar's look hasn't changed drastically and its functionality is as good as ever. There are four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple reminders for each event and search through all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google has redone its Clock app, giving it a major overhaul. Opening it brings you to your local time giving you the ability to add as many additional world capital cities as you'd like (they will also be visible on your lockscreen widget upon expanding).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The usual alarm functionality is still present, albeit the fresh new design. You can set multiple alarms, each with its own repeat pattern, ringtone and label. The app also comes with a stopwatch and a timer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big, easily thumbable keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Nexus 4 comes with a GPS receiver, which took about a minute to get satellite lock upon a cold start (it supports GLONASS for faster, more accurate locks too). You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need an estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is a standard part of the Android package and we've covered it many times before. It offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>3D buildings are shown for some of the bigger cities and you can use two-finger camera tilt and rotate to get a better view of the area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also plan routes, search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View. The app will reroute you if you get off course, even without a data connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache London and some surrounding regions before Maps told us the area is too big. Also, there's no address search in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, the Google Nexus 4 has access to the latest available apps. Still, don't go overboard with installing every app you see, as your storage is pretty limited due to the lack of microSD card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Top of the line chipset, an excellent screen and the latest Android version - does it get better than this? Well, if you are Google, it actually does. The Nexus 4 is a proper flagship smartphone, but with a mid-market price tag. It costs just ?300/$300 SIM-free with 8GB of inbuilt storage and ?350/$350 for the more sensible 16GB version. That's about the same as a Galaxy S II, which is 18 months old now and long past its prime.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not the usual way to have a smartphone deliver a loud bang for your buck. OEMs would normally go for an aging chipset, which has dropped to bargain prices, and lower screen resolution to reduce the strain on the GPU. But not Google - the search giant gave up profits, hoping that Play Store sales will make up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of Google's own partners might be upset by a strategy they clearly cannot afford, but that's hardly the point here. What matters is that it's a win-win for customers and has turned the Nexus 4 into an offer that's near impossible to beat. A fast-track pass to future Android updates only comes to sweeten up an already great deal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the Google Nexus 4 is not without its limitations either and the biggest one is probably down to the very market strategy that helped the smartphone get where it is today. We mean the internal storage of course, which at 16GB is probably enough for the majority of users, but the fact that some competitors can as much as quadruple it isn't exactly a confidence booster. Google will gladly sell you some cloud space to help you off but, as we've discussed many times, that's by far not an ideal solution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other weakness that the Google Nexus 4 rivals will be hoping to exploit is stock Android. While for some it's the best that Android can look, Holo is not nearly as feature-rich as Nature UX, Sense UI and Optimus UI. A custom launcher from the Play Store will go some way towards providing a solution for this problem, but it's not quite there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see, it's small things like smart dial and turn to mute, which we wouldn't mind having. And the list goes on with USB OTG, social network integration, Samsung's Smart Stay feature, LG's Wise Screen, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are a few other issues, as well, but we doubt any of them will be deal-breakers. The camera is sub-par and the screen has solid credentials but falls slightly short of the best in business. What's a bit surprising here is that it looks worse than the Optimus G, most probably due to poor calibration.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a few smartphones that make a good alternative if any of the things above ruined the deal for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The kind of Android hill for much of 2012, Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III brings expandable storage, an AMOLED screen with way better contrast and a bunch of cool software tricks like Multi-View, Direct call and the above mentioned smart stay. That one also has a superior camera and better battery life than the Nexus 4 (not to mention that its battery is replaceable).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the other hand the Galaxy S III display uses a PenTile matrix, which damages its perceived sharpness and even after undergoing several price cuts still costs about ?60 more than the Nexus 4. It also uses an Exynos 4 Quad chipset, which can't really match the power of the S4 Pro inside the Google pure-bred.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9300 Galaxy S III</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can always consider the LG Optimus G, which is, for the most part, identical to the Nexus 4. It does offer twice the storage and LG has done a better job at calibrating the display of that one resulting in more accurate colors than the Nexus 4 has.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Optimus G is still stuck on ICS though, and is one of the most expensive smartphones of the market for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus G E973</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has a couple of One X versions to put up against the Nexus 4. The original One X comes with 32GB of storage, while the recently released One X+ offers 64 gigs. Both of them have better quality screens than the Nexus 4 (though no curved glass on top), but they can't match its pricing nor its raw power.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC One X ? HTC One X+</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The flaw that those alternatives share is of course the higher asking price. It's simply impossible for any smartphone in the Nexus 4's price bracket to match its offer. There's also the question of after-market support, but that can really go either way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power users will appreciate the raw power and vast customization potential of stock Android, looking at it as a blank canvas, ready to be painted as they see fit. Those who have a more casual attitude to their smartphones, however, might feel more comfortable with an Optimus UI-skinned ICS on the Optimus G, or Nature UX on the S III, than the stock 4.2 Jelly Bean on the Nexus. Each to their own of course, but there's no denying that Google has a real winner here. It's a shame then, that it's not as readily available as the Nexus 7 tablet.</paragraph>
