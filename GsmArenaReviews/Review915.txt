			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've been enjoying an open season for a while, and yeah, the shootouts will keep on coming but it's a different kind of game now. What we have here is exactly the type that can, and will, see the hunted become the hunter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dragons, all three of them. Snapdragon 800-powered, 1080p-screen-flaunting, LTE-connected fire-breathing super-phones that know the Android crown is there for the taking. Which, by extension, would be the smartphone crown, period, in the eyes of the vast majority of users out there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>None of our three contenders will settle for a draw. They're playing to win, a position they've earned by making little or no compromise from the drawing board to the retail box.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has the smallest footprint of them all, but doesn't sacrifice screen estate. Just the opposite actually, it flaunts a 5.2-incher with the slimness of the bezels bordering on the insane. The G2 also has optical image stabilization - something the other two here lack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Considering this is the smallest smartphone in the bunch, we can't help but be impressed that not only does it have a bigger display than the Xperia Z1 but also matches its 3000mAh battery. Here is the list of weapons the G2 hopes to help it win the battle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>LG G2 over Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Sony Xperia Z1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next up is the Samsung phablet. The Galaxy Note 3 is a monster in size but state-of-the-art technology lets you keep it on a short leash with the S Pen. Snapdragon 800 is matched by the others, but there's no coming close to the 3 gigs of RAM. The 13MP camera is pretty impressive too and we have the biggest battery of the bunch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen of the Galaxy Note 3 is the biggest at 5.7" and the only Super AMOLED panel on offer. The S Pen is of course worth more than just a mention, not only turning the Galaxy Note 3 into a digital notebook but adding a whole new dimension to the navigation. The 4K video recording is another leg up on the competition.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 3 over the LG G2 and Sony Xperia Z1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Sony Xperia Z1. For starters, it's almost as big as the Note 3 and way bigger than the LG G2, which has a larger screen. To make up for it, the water-tight Sony Xperia Z1 and is also dust resistant.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has the best spec'd camera with a large 1/2.3" sensor (around 70% bigger than the smartphone standard) and 20.7MP of resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is perhaps too much screen bezel but Sony must've thought it's well worth the aluminum frame and shatter-proof glass used.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1 over the LG G2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's no easy pick here, considering they all have the latest hardware and software, but each of these smartphones has more than enough ways to connect to its audience. Unmistakably premium finish and water resistance can easily tip the scales in Sony Xperia Z1's favor if design and durability are high on your list. But then, if you want as much screen estate as humanly possible in a body that's still compact enough to be pocketable, the LG G2 has you covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Or, if a phablet is what you want, then look no further than the Note 3. Samsung premiered the stylus-enabled large-screened smartphones two years ago and has perfected its software to make the Note 3 the best handset with pen support you can buy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But what if you want the all-round package? Well, you know the drill. We're going to look at camera performance, benchmarks, battery, the lot. So stick around, it's going to be an interesting ride.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before we look at the design philosophies behind each of our contenders, it's important to note that regardless of differences in size and weight, build and finish, we're talking quad-core Snapdragon 800 each, battery capacities of around 3000mAh and 1080p screens with still cameras of 13MP or above. These are the base ingredients you need for a top-of-the-line droid, but each manufacturer packaged them differently in the cases of our three smartphones today.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 did almost feel like a freak of nature at first. Holding it in hand you'd never expect what's to come at you full speed - you unlock straight into a jaw-dropping edge-to-edge display. The LG G2's screen sits comfortably in the middle - bigger than the Sony Xperia Z1's and smaller than the Samsung Galaxy Note 3's but in a shell that's brilliantly compact - smaller than both.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the surprises the LG G2 has in store don't end there. The volume controls and the power button are placed at the back, below the camera lens and right under your index finger. While some might find it difficult to get used to, the button layout is quite comfortable and really enhances the streamlined feel of the device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build is entirely plastic with a glossy finish to it, which isn't everyone's cup of tea but it doesn't feel cheap or tacky.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's Note 3 has angular design, which is pretty much free of embellishments. Samsung delivered a much better Galaxy Note than last year's model without making it bigger or heavier. The Note 3 packs a bigger screen, more robust battery, better camera and processor, and has kept the three button layout and the S Pen compartment, all while shedding some weight and making the phone thinner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 easily stands out among most of the recent Samsung flagship phones that have been criticized for their glossy plastic finish. For the back panel of the Note 3, Samsung decided to forgo hyperglazing in favor of a textured plastic, which emulates leather, complete with the stitching. And while emulating the looks is nothing to write home about, Samsung also got the feel right and the Galaxy Note 3 oozes refinement and quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Deservedly taking pride in the design of its top-shelf phones, Sony have wisely decided to keep the all-glass front and back. The glass is shatter-proof and scratch resistant, covering a frame carved out of a single piece of aluminum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z feels really firm and well-built and doesn't seem to mind being unwieldy and heavy. It's 2 g heavier than a Galaxy Note 3 and almost as big. Some of that can be credited to the water resistance while the large camera sensor and module has certainly contributed too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While there's no denying the Sony Xperia Z1 is a big phone it does back it up with some serious specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Held in hand, it's more than obvious which is the most comfortable phone in the group. The LG G2 wins this one by miles by being both the most compact and lightweight of the bunch. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is very comfortable for its size and weight with the Sony Xperia Z1 giving you the most difficulty for the least amount of screen real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest phone here is also the thinnest but by as little as 0.2 mm. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is 8.3 mm, followed by the Sony Xperia Z1 at 8.5 mm and finally, the LG G2, which is 8.9 mm at its thickest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it gets to the controls, the LG G2 stays true to its minimalist design. The sides of the phone are completely bare save for the ejectable SIM tray on the left. Otherwise the edges are nicely sloped and totally clean.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3's sides hold the power button on the right and the volume rocker on the left side. The plastic rim around the front and back has a silvery, faux aluminum finish and the edges have recessed lines, resembling remotely the pages of a notebook.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 has a dedicated camera button, placed in the lower right corner, a single-piece volume rocker above it and the now typical prominent power button on the right. The microSD card slot is located under a flap on the right side. Across on the left, there are two plastic lids covering the microUSB port and the microSIM card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the LG G2 features nothing but an IR blaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 has an IR blaster of its own too, and it sits on its top along with a 3.5 mm headphone jack and a noise-reducing microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 also features the 3.5 mm headphone jack at the top, thankfully, not under a sealed lid like with the Sony Xperia Z.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On its bottom, the LG G2 has little grilles for the speaker and the main microphone. There's a 3.5 mm headphone jack at the bottom along with the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 has a few surprises at its bottom side. Along with the main microphone and speaker grille, it features the world's first microUSB 3.0 port on a phone, and the S Pen compartment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 has no functional elements at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving over to the back where the cameras are. The LG G2 has a lot going on there, it is not just the imaging-related stuff. The volume keys are either side of the power button, which has a "breathing" LED under it. Then there's the optically-stabilized 13 MP camera lens and a single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the LG G2 has a hyperglazed-like finish with a pattern underneath that plays with light - the pattern changes depending on the angle you are looking it. Finally, there's a brushed-aluminum LG logo at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The textured plastic at back of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 would really have you believe the finish is actual leather. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with a 13MP still camera capable of 4K video recording. Unlike on the other two, you can pop the back cover open to reveal the 3,200mAh battery along with the microSIM and microSD card slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 has a very clean but premium-looking all-glass back. The 20.7MP camera lens is nicely recessed within a steel ring. The single LED flash is right under it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, splitting the win three ways isn't just us going the way of least resistance. All three obviously have their flaws but we do believe they're vastly outweighed by the benefits. The LG G2 hasn't got a memory card slot, the Z1 is too big for its screen size, and the Note 3 is a phablet - which is to say, way too big for many people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet, clever optimizations for single-handed use make the Note more comfortable to operate than some phones with far smaller screens. The edge-to-edge screen in a package as compact as the LG G2 will make it easier for many users to live without memory expansion. The looks and feel, and the water-resistance of the Z1 will probably make you forgive the overly ample bezels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yes, compromises have been made by all three manufacturers but could have they done a much better job? We don't think so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. That kind of screen real estate in a body this size. Enough said. In terms of screen to surface ratio and pocketability, the LG G2 is deservedly the winner. The experiment of moving the hardware controls around back worked out fine and the solid battery backup in a compact body is another point earned.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. It's a phablet and you cannot hold size against it, but even so, the fact that it packs a bigger screen and battery into a smaller body than the previous generation is admirable. More importantly though, although it accommodates a stylus and has a USB 3.0 port, the Note 3 is still slimmer than the Xperia Z1. The Note 3 is also the only one with a removable battery, and has expandable memory, which the LG G2 lacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z1. If you're paying for a high-end gadget, it'd better look like one. Easily, the best looking gadget of the three isn't obviously the one with the best ergonomics, but aluminum and glass is a combination none of the others can match. There's memory expansion here too, which is no small feat considering the Z1 is water and dust-resistant. There you go, premium build and looks and IP58 certification are as good arguments as any in favor of the Z1.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Displays<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The displays on all three of our contestants are top of the line, specs-wise. Each of them sports at least 5 inches of diagonal and 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. The pixel density on each of the three displays is close to or even above 400 ppi, so it's safe to say that every image will be crisp and clear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2's has a 5.2" True HD-IPS + LCD display that's good for around 424 pixels per inch. The Galaxy Note 3 uses a 5.7" Super AMOLED screen adding up to around 386 ppi, whereas the Sony Xperia Z1 goes for a 5" Triluminous display with the X-Reality engine and being the smallest display of the three, it also offers the highest pixel density - 441 ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All but the Galaxy Note 3 use the standard RGB matrix with an equal number of red, green and blue pixels. The Galaxy Note 3 has a PenTile matrix, which has two subpixels per pixel. In theory this matrix is inferior as it may result in dottiness, but that stopped being an issue when pixel densities crossed the 300ppi mark. So while you might notice that the Note 3 is not quite as sharp as the other two if you look from way close than is comfortable - the three are virtually on par at normal viewing distances.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  The display matrices</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So let's look at the numbers from our dedicated display tests. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has the clear advantage when it comes to contrast ratio and depth of blacks. Because AMOLED screens can switch individual pixels off, the blacks are as deep as they get. This also means that under ideal circumstances, contrast is practically unlimited. The weakness of AMOLEDs is the brightness, where they fail to match LCDs without breaking the power bank.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2's display has the upper hand in brightness but its contrast slightly degrades when you go all the way up to 100% brightness. Still it's contrast is, for all purposes practical, equal to that of the Sony Xperia Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Outdoors, the light tends to be stronger and the sun would often shine right on your phone's display. That's when the contrast deteriorates and the best thing a manufacturer can do is use a less reflective glass and rely on the screen brightness to overcome that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because AMOLEDs have one glass layer less than conventional LCD displays the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a clear advantage in screen legibility in direct sunlight, even though its brightness may not be class-leading. The Sony Xperia Z1 is close behind. The G2 can still be operated trouble free in the sun, but the colors of its screen get washed out and it loses more of its brilliance than the other two.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to viewing angles, the LG G2 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 are so great that it's next to impossible to tell them apart. Both screens make the icons and images look as if painted on top of the glass. The Sony Xperia Z1 is a step up from Sony's prior flagships but is still notably behind the other two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, in terms of color rendering, the LG G2 offers nice natural colors, although it offers no choice of screen modes. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes punchy and oversaturated by default, but you can use its screen modes to tune that down for a very natural look. The Xperia Z1 also has fairly accurate color reproduction, which can get a boost out of the X-Reality engine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Super AMOLED display on the Galaxy Note 3 is our choice here. It's much bigger than the displays of the other two, it has superior contrast, naturally deep blacks and the unmatched flexibility of screen modes. You can pick between nicely saturated, punchy colors that just pop out or natural colors that are great for photo editing. And at this resolution and pixel density the once objectionable PenTile matrix is no longer an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2. The LG G2 has a spectacular display with great colors, brightness and contrast. It came in last in the sunlight test, but the larger size and the better viewing angles helped it edge out the Xperia Z1's Triluminous screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Sony Xperia Z1. The Sony Xperia Z1 has the best screen the company's smartphone lineup has seen, but the less than perfect viewing angles take away some of its high-end vibe. It's not a screen anyone will be unhappy about, but it comes slightly short of the other two participants here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With screens this big and beefy chipsets, the three contenders have no choice but to go with ample batteries if they want to offer decent battery life. The LG G2 has a 3,000mAh Li-Po battery, matched by the Sony Xperia Z1, while the Galaxy Note 3 has a slightly larger 3,200mAh juice pack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're done with the tests of all three devices so we're going to break down the performance again here. We start with talk time, where the Sony Xperia Z1 takes the lead with a 26:53h, which is almost two hours better than the second best, LG G2. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 surprisingly came last here with a score of just 18:12h - certainly impressive, but not quite up to par with the other two.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Talk time<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Web browsing is where the LG G2 claimed its first victory, scoring the impressive 11:22h. The Galaxy Note 3 came second with a little over 9 hours, while the Sony Xperia Z1 lagged behind with just under 6 hours of web browsing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playback is a very important part of a smartphone's skill set. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 made it one win each, lasting for about 13 and a half hours of movie watching, followed closely by the LG G2, while the Sony Xperia Z1 is again far behind with only 6:12h.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video playback<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Combined with the stand-by times that we've measured, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 managed an overall rating of 75h. The LG G2 follows with 62 hours and, finally, we see the Sony Xperia Z1, which started on a high note but ended up with only 53 hours.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung phablet has another advantage over its rivals - its battery is user replaceable. This means that you can easily change a dead or defective unit, or always carry a spare for those cases when every drop of juice is critical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Not only is this the one to score the highest rating, but also the only one to feature a replaceable battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2. The LG G2 was actually a much closer second than its score suggests. Its stand-by performance let it down somewhat, but it did great in the individual tests - something that matters quite a lot to power users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Sony Xperia Z1. The Xperia Z1 got a great talk time score but then posted mediocre web browsing and video playback scores. Its overall performance is certainly good, but it's not quite up there with the other two.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Three takes on Android<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 and Sony Xperia Z1 are rocking Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2 while the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 offers the latest version, 4.3. The advantages of the newer OS version include OpenGL ES 3.0 for higher-quality graphics support, Wi-Fi localization, better memory management but not too much in terms of new core functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have demo videos of all three running their custom software atop Android. The LG G2 offers its Optimus UI, Samsung has its TouchWiz and finally, Sony's got the Xperia UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG customizations run deep and there's a rich selection of themes, changeable icons and custom apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cool LG lockscreen that lets you peek beneath is onboard. There are five animations for the peek hole type - the familiar dewdrop, ripple, while hole, crystal and the default particle. All of them are really cool and we honestly had a hard time deciding on which effect we like best. You can also place up to five shortcuts on your lockscreen that will unlock the phone straight into an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG home-baked tweaks and enhancements are by no means limited to the visuals. The Q Slide option makes it possible for you to use widget-like resizable small apps while using other full-screen apps. The system-wide Quick Memo integration allows you to take a screenshot anywhere in the phone and take notes over it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 also comes with some cool options like Guest Mode, Slide Aside multitasking, KnockON lock/unlock, lockscreen widgets and more. We'll get to all of them further down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since LG has put the Lock/Unlock hardware key at the back of the G2, the company has come up with another idea that can potentially make this key redundant if its placement is not to your liking. You can wake the screen with a double tap. It works flawlessly once you get used to applying a little more force compared to how you'd tap if you were actually using the phone. To lock the phone you don't need to use the hardware key either. You just double tap on an empty area of your homescreen or on the status bar no matter where you are - it will lock your G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen now has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The page to the right is special and fires up the camera, but you can easily disable it from the widget menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the multiple account support that premiered with the Android 4.2, LG was able to support the so-called Guest Mode. To activate it, you use a custom unlock pattern, which is different to your regular one. In Guest Mode the user only has access to a pre-defined set of apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already mentioned the Q Slide shortcuts that are found in the notification area. They launch pop-up widget-like versions of the video player, web browser, phone, messages, calendar, email, memo, voice recorder, file manager and calculator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Q Slide feature is very similar to Sony's small apps but supports only two windows opened simultaneously. You can resize the mini app however you like, there is a dedicated shortcut that'll take you to the full screen app. There is also a transparency slider.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has also been tweaked by LG to let you rearrange the toggle buttons available. You are also free to add and remove toggles from the edit menu. You can add an insane amount of shortcuts here, and don't have to worry about whether they'll fit on the screen - the row becomes side-scrollable so you can still access them all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default you get three homescreen panes to fill up with widgets and shortcuts, but you are free to add more (up to seven) or delete any that you don't need to speed up navigation. You can also set any of the homescreens as default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a set of different icons to choose from and you can even make custom ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer lists all your available apps and widgets, with a dedicated tab for user downloads. There is a button in the top right corner, which triggers edit mode and lets you to easily reshuffle or uninstall applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt to make the icons in the app drawer bigger, too. If you select an app whilst in edit mode, a pop up will let you see information like storage usage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG has implemented a new multi-tasking feature called Slide Aside. You can use a three-finger swipe from the right side of the screen to add the app into the Slide Aside UI, while three finger swipes from the left will switch between the running apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Slide Aside supports up to three apps, which get into a sort of frozen state and you can access a preview of all the three apps either form the notification area's dedicated shortcut or via a three-finger swipe to the left on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is the recap of the LG's Optimus UI key strengths:</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Next comes the rundown of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 UI. We start with the lockscreen, which features the widgets introduced with Android 4.2.2 on the Galaxy S4. The default lockscreen shows the time along with a personal message overlaid on beautiful photos pulled from TripAdvisor (with text at the bottom about where the photo was taken).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose what effect to add to the unlocking. The options include Oil paint and watercolor, which blur the color on screen as if you were dragging a wet paint brush through the screen. You can also opt for the well-known ripple and light effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing a single widget. The pane to the right of the default one is special and can either be a list of favorite apps (the default TouchWiz setting) or a shortcut for the camera (as in pure Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another nice trick is the Quick glance option we first saw on the Galaxy Note II. It uses the proximity sensor to detect you reaching for the device and it lights up the screen and shows the time, missed call and message counters, battery charge and music track info.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features five (or eight in landscape mode) toggles that can quickly enable and disable features. There are more than five toggles, of course, you can swipe horizontally to get to the others. Or you can tap the expand button, which reveals a grid of all the shortcuts, 22 in total. A two finger swipe directly opens the grid of toggles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the toggles is the display brightness slider complete with an Auto toggle. You can remove this slider to get more room for notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the homescreen, Samsung has provided many of its own custom widgets like Samsung Hub, S Travel, etc. There's the wrap around feature, which lets you scroll homescreens in a loop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch zoom to get into overview mode with all homescreen panes visible simultaneously. There can be up to 7 and you can easily add, remove and rearrange panes from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer shortcuts are presented as a customizable grid, alphabetized grid or list and you can hide icons (good for bloatware you can't uninstall), view only downloaded apps, uninstall apps and add folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 comes with Multi-window, which now allows launching two instances of the same app - i.e. you can have two Chrome windows next to each other. There is also dedicated shortcut that lets you switch the places of the two opened apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Copying stuff from one of the opened apps to the other is now available and is done in just three taps. It's a definite improvement and something the multi-window feature needed badly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We noticed there is pretty decent app support for the multi-window service at launch with even more supported apps on the way. It's a feature that will be used really often and we are happy to see Samsung extending its support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can move the small arrow that brings up the drawer with the Multi-window apps to make it easier to reach with your thumb. You can also move the whole drawer to the other side of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A particularly cool feature, exclusive to the Galaxy Note 3, is one-hand operation. Unlike previous versions of the feature though, it is not limited to the keypad and the calculator. This time you can minimize the whole interface with a simple double swipe and you are effectively making the Galaxy Note 3 use only a corner of its screen. The volume buttons are also brought to the tip of your fingers so you can operate the handset as if it was a 4-inch screen (or slightly more - custom resizing is available) rather than a 5.7-inch one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you pop the S Pen out of its holster, you'll be greeted by the new Air Command menu. The new menu is available throughout the interface, and can be opened at any time by just pressing the side button on the S-Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Air Command menu is a virtual ring with five shortcuts - Action Memo, Scrap Booker, Screen Write, S Finder and Pen Window.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Action Memo lets you write stuff and then use it to initiate an action - i.e. add a contact name and number to your phonebook, or check out an address on Google Maps. You just need to mark a part of the text and send it to one of the relevant apps. The handwriting recognition is impressively fast and accurate - it handles just about everything you throw at it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrap Booker lets you add pieces of your screen to... well, a Scrapbook. You don't need to take a full screenshot - just mark the stuff you need. The Scrap Booker will automatically extract pictures and text from the selected area and will save them to one of your Scrapbook categories. You can then add an optional memo to every scrapbook entry you create.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Screen Write allows you to start writing on the display no matter what screen you are on. You can either use a clean sheet or use a snapshot of the screen you are currently using. It's the best tool for taking quick memos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S-Search is a local search that'll browse through all the content on your Note 3 with preset filters. It can search in all S-Pen content you've added (including notes, scrapbook pages, etc.), messages, multimedia, settings, phonebook, even the internet. Naturally, all handwritten stuff is an easy job for the S-Search. You can even search for symbols you've drawn with the S-Pen. That last one seems to work quite slowly, however, and unless you actually use the scrapbook quite a lot you probably won't need it that often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last element of the Air Command menu is Pen Window. It lets you launch a mini window with one of the supported apps by drawing a rectangle on the screen. The Galaxy Note 3 will then fit the floating app in the said rectangle (in the correct aspect, of course).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's more but you get the idea. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has what neither the LG G2 nor the Sony Xperia Z1 have - a stylus with impressive software backing that lets you get the best out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what the advantages the Galaxy Note 3 holds over its peers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 gives you the option to add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and set any of them as default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The background for the virtual on-screen buttons is black when you are running an app and completely transparent when you are browsing homescreen panes and menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has multiple panes, each containing one widget. The rightmost pane is special and fires up the camera. The other panes can accommodate various widgets: Email, Gmail, Google Now, Calendar, Google+ posts, TrackID and Digital clock. You can download apps from the Play Store that add new widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a few toggles (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Brightness by default). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. This time around, the toggles are customizable. You can choose between 16 different quick toggles and have up to 10 of them visible in the notification area across two rows of shortcuts. You can even opt out of having the Settings key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along the bottom, there are four docked shortcuts (two each side of the app drawer shortcut). These are visible across all homescreen panes and are user configurable: they can be either single icons or folders with multiple items, in which case you get smaller icons of the first four shortcuts in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there. If you tap and hold on an app, a green Add to Homescreen field will appear on top of the app drawer. Just drag the icon and drop it there and you will go back to your homescreen and place a shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 also has mini apps that pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app. So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the Sony Xperia Z1 key software strengths:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Galaxy Note 3 has the most functional custom launcher, running on top of the the most recent Android release. Its multitasking is second to none in the mobile world, while the S Pen and its apps add a whole new dimension to the smartphone experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2. The LG G2 is following closely with another very rich home-baked launcher, offering a bunch of exclusive features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Sony Xperia Z1. The Sony flagship has probably the best looking UI of the bunch, but lags behind in terms of functionality and customization options.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We'll now analyze the performance of the three Snapdragon 800-wielding beasts. Here are the profiles of the competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only minor differences are to be expected - the Galaxy Note 3 and G2 have slightly higher clock speed at 2.27 GHz and 2.26 GHz, respectively, while the Sony Xperia Z1 has its four Krait cores running at 2.2 GHz.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RAM is 2 gigs for the Sony and LG flagships, while Samsung has made the world's first smartphone with 3GB of RAM, which should give the Galaxy Note 3 an edge when it comes to multitasking. And finally, due to it being a Jelly Bean 4.3 smartphone, the Galaxy Note 3 has OpenGL ES 3.0 support so it should show better graphics performance for apps and games that are designed to take advantage of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll start with BenchmarkPi, which measures the calculative performance of the CPU cores. The Galaxy Note 3 and G2 tie for first place here, probably due to their higher clock speed, while the Xperia Z1 is close behind.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linpack is able to test multi-threaded CPU performance. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 scored a win here, followed closely by the LG G2, with the Sony Xperia Z1 in tow.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant and AnTuTu 4 gauge the overall device performance instead of just the CPU. The Samsung flagship topped AnTuTu but finished second in Quadrant, trading places with the Xperia Z1. The LG G2 cames up last on both occasions, although differences weren't huge.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>GeekBench 3 is a test of CPU and memory. The Galaxy Note 3 secured the first place here, followed by the Xperia Z1. The LG G2 was some way behind, indicating that its memory may not be quite as fast as that of its two competitors.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the graphics test, the Galaxy Note 3 topped both GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt and 2.7 T-Rex benchmarks, followed by the Sony Xperia Z1. The LG G2 posted excellent scores on both, but couldn't match its rivals.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Now it's time to look at browsing performance. SunSpider tests out JavaScript performance, while BrowserMark 2 focuses on HTML 5 and Vellamo is an all-round benchmark. JavaScript saw the Galaxy Note 3 well in front with the Xperia Z1 and LG G2 in second and third place, respectively. HTML 5 performance saw the LG G2 and Sony Xperia Z1 trade places as the Galaxy Note 3 retained its lead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note 3 failed to impress in the Vellamo test, dropping to third, even if it was close to the Xperia Z1 and the G2 in front.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>Keep in mind that scores aside, all three smartphones are in a league of their own when it comes to performance. There's no lag to be found anywhere, pages load quickly, animations are super fast, games start in an instant and run perfectly and all those pixels are being pushed to the screen effortlessly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whichever of the three you go with, you'll never feel like it's slower than the other two - Snapdragon 800 and Android Jelly Bean will see to that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The extra gig of RAM and the newest Android version saw the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 dominate most benchmarks and when it wasn't in the lead it wasn't too far behind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: Sony Xperia Z1. The Sony Xperia Z1 has a minor disadvantage in terms of clock speed, but managed to edge out a victory thanks to its GPU and memory performance, which was a tad better than that of the LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: LG G2. A stellar performer in its own right, the LG G2 come a tad short of its rivals here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image galleries<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Having a big display is great for browsing images. But the software side of the gallery is not to be neglected either. Coming from Android, which has a great and feature-rich stock gallery we expect the proprietary Optimus, TouchWiz and Xperia galleries to be pretty great. Which one is the best, though?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 gallery features stacks of photos in albums, location or time. The different sets are tiled neatly across the screen. You can expand or shrink individual albums using a pinch to zoom gesture, making the elements of the grid of photos either really huge or very tiny.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once selected, you can view an image close up by pinch zooming or double tapping on the desired area. There is a sliding gallery along the bottom which allows you to quickly browse other images in the album. On the top there are three shortcuts for quickly sharing, editing or deleting the selected photo.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The gallery on the Galaxy Note 3 is sorted into albums, all photos and videos, time, location, etc. There's also a spiral option, which revamps the gallery into a spiral of images and video, which after a while might even get a bit nauseating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can pinch to zoom in the gallery and thus manage the thumbnail size. Air view works in the gallery as well. You can hover your finger/stylus above an image and you'll get a bigger thumbnail preview of the image or you can hover above folders to peek inside their contents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Upon choosing an album (for instance Camera) you're taken into that albums' stack of photos but a swipe to the right will reveal a bar on the left with all the albums. This means you can change albums without going through the gallery homescreen every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing photos on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is a joy. The screen is ample and the Super AMOLED can give you colors punchier than anything else on the market. If you know what "color profile" is you can enable the Adobe RGB screen mode for accurate color rendering, if not you can just enjoy the vibrant colors of the default setting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pictures is the main tab and one of its features managed to impress us: you can make the image thumbnails bigger or smaller, either with a pinch gesture or a sideways swipe. The whole thing is very responsive and hundreds of thumbs fall in and out of differently sized grids in a nifty animation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a second tab here, My Albums, which includes online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa) along with albums stored on devices in the local network. Also here are some special albums - Maps and Globe, which use the geo-tagging info to display photos where they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a perfectly organized gallery with some nice extra functionality enabled by the S Pen. Along with the impressive screen this is more than enough to earn the phablet the win here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: Sony Xperia Z1. The Sony Xperia Z1's Album app offers lots of eye-candy with cool animations and smooth transitions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: LG G2. The LG G2 has an excellent gallery, which comes just a feature or two behind its competitors here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video playback is one of the things high-end smartphones such as the LG G2, Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Sony Xperia Z1 will be used for most often. Let's see what our contestants offer in this department.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the G2 has a fairly simple interface, giving you just a grid of all the videos on the device. There's an alphabet scroll to help users locate videos faster but that's about it. You can, of course, play videos from the Gallery if you prefer its folder-centric organization. For each video you've started, the thumbnail gets a tiny clock icon, which shows how far into the video you are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface during playback is nothing overcomplicated, yet it's quite powerful. The live preview is a YouTube-like pop up preview of the video above the scrubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the regular timeline scrubber, play and pause controls, the Optimus player has MX Player-like controls - a swipe left or right will move the video forward or backwards, while a swipe up or down will tweak brightness. One of the new additions is a Video Speed control (you can set values from 0.5x up to 2x). There's a lock button too, which hides all controls for pure full-screen viewing. Another cool feature in the video player is Live Zooming. You can zoom in (with the familiar pinch gesture) during playback and some serious magnification is allowed, not just a quick resize or fit to screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 handled everything we threw at it - DivX, XviD, MKV and MP4/MOV up to, and including, 1080p resolution. The AC3 audio codec (among lots of others) is supported, so you don't have to worry about the sound decoding. There are were no issues with higher bitrates and file sizes, either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player also supports all popular subtitles formats. You can open subtitles manually in case the subtitle file is not using the same name as the video file. Non-Latin subtitles are supported as well and there are the usual options of choosing the font, color, size, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG took Samsung's pop-up play feature a whole lot further with QSlide. In the latest Optimus UI iteration, LG has added a new batch of apps that take advantage of the functionality. Those include the web browser, Memo, Voice recorder, Calendar, Calculator and more. Furthermore, you can launch any of them from the notification drawer.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player, found on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has the last watched video on top for quick access. Under it there are three tabs - personal (showing you the videos on your local storage), Download (which lets into the Videos store) and Nearby devices, which shows the PCs and players on your local Wi-Fi network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grid view is our favorite as it is really highlights the power of the quad-core beast - the visible video thumbnails are actually playing the videos instead of being static images. They play at a reduced framerate and generating those previews takes a couple of minutes the first time around, but it's an awesome feature that shows what can be done when you have processing power to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chapter preview detects chapters in the video and shows a rectangular grid, with live thumbnails (just like the grid view above). Hovering your finger (or the S Pen) over the timescroll lets you preview part of the video in a small thumbnail - just like YouTube videos do when you hover the mouse of your computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pop up play is here too - it moves the video in a small floating window and you can use other apps on the phone while still watching the video. You can use pinch zoom to adjust the size of the video or move it around, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 offered a list of subtitles and lets us pick one. It scans for all subtitles, so the file doesn't have to have the same name as the video file.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 played everything we threw at it. There were no issues with bitrate, resolution or sound (AC3 or otherwise).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Movies, the video player on the Sony Xperia Z1, has a great custom UI, reminiscent of HTPC interfaces. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TV shows you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The controls are very minimalist - there's the play/pause, forward and rewind as well as a time scrubber.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia Z1 didn't experience any difficulties playing 720p and 1080p videos. It loaded them pretty swiftly and that's no surprise considering the hardware that's under the hood. MP4, DivX, X264 and MOV files played without a glitch, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, Sony still refuses to pre-install codec support for AVI, MKV and XviD video file formats. The Movies player didn't play them at all, and neither did it open an AC3-sound DivX video we tried. That's easily fixable with a quick stop over at the Google Play Store where you can get a hold of a third-party video player with an enhanced codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the system video player on an Android smartphone doesn't cut it for you, there are always other options for free from the Play store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Samsung's flagship goes the whole nine yards when it comes to video playback. It supports just about every codec available out there and offers cool live pop-up previews, subtitle support, the lot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2. The LG G2 can match the wide codec support of the Galaxy Note 3 and comes very close in terms of extra features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Sony Xperia Z1. The poor codec support meant the Xperia Z1 never stood a chance of placing higher here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Music players<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's move on to music players - the final chapter of our multimedia comparison.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player on the LG G2 has a simple interface. It's easy to use, but still offers a lot functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface places a big album art image in the center with controls above and below it. Swiping the album art left or right is the easiest way to skip songs back and forth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A press and hold on the album art will bring up a search menu, if you need to look up the title, artist or the album. After that you can pick where to search - your music collection, YouTube or a general Internet search. Flipping the device to landscape mode while on the Now playing screen squeezes in a list of other songs by the same artist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are several equalizer presets and you can even create custom ones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The TouchWiz music player on the Galaxy Note 3 is jam-packed with features and supports a wide variety of file formats, including FLAC and WAV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's Music square - it's quite similar to the SensMe feature of Sony smartphones. It automatically rates a song as exciting or calm, passionate or joyful and plots those songs on a square (hence the name).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing screen gives you the usual options - a timescroll of the song, play/pause and back/forth controls, repeat and shuffle, volume control but it also adds lyrics support, AllShare shortcut and a direct sound settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a couple of features that will improve your listening experience further. One is Smart Sound, which equalizes the volume between tracks. The other is Adapt Sound - it plays a series of beeps (both high and low frequency) and asks if you can hear them. This way the phone can map the capacities of your specific headset and fine-tune its output for optimal sonic experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the calibration is complete, the Galaxy Note 3 shows you the kind of gain you're receiving by keeping Adapt Sound on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the Walkman music player. The Walkman is divided into Playing and My music panels. In the My music section, you can update your album art and music information like album, year released, and more. SensMe is included, meaning you can filter your songs by mood - upbeat, energetic, mellow, dance, etc. Creating playlists is enabled and you can also view your Facebook friends' activity if they too use the Walkman player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen offers the standard music controls, shortcuts to the library, "Infinity" key and the song cover art. The Infinity key lets you quickly look up a song on YouTube or browse for the lyrics, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has improved on the Walkman player's settings. There's the familiar ClearAudio+ option, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And audio fans will be pleased as there is a configurable 5-band equalizer with bass adjustment. However dedicated audiophiles might want to consider alternatives off the Play Store, with support for a 10 or even 20-band equalizer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winners: Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Sony Xperia Z1. Both phones offer excellent sound personalizations, Samsung's Adapt Sound has no alternative, while Sony's ClearAudio+ is great at automatically selection the optimal settings for different tracks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2. The LG flagship is equipped with a great music player but can't match the other two in terms of features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All three smartphones delivered almost spotlessly clean audio output so picking a winner here was quite hard. Still, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 managed to take the victory with its louder output, and slightly lower stereo crosstalk when headphones were plugged in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 and the Sony Xperia Z1 are basically identical as far as their audio output is concerned. They perform excellently both with and without headphones but are let down by their uninspiring volume levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Frequency response of the three smartphones</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-ups: Sony Xperia Z1 and LG G2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Loudspeaker<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Our Loudspeaker performance test saw all three of our contenders as slightly below average. However, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was slightly above the LG G2 and the Sony Xperia Z1, which had the lowest overall score. Still, at least it has the water-tightness as an excuse, something the other two don't have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. A simple game of numbers that the Samsung flagship won by the smallest of margins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2. Just behind the Galaxy Note 3, and a slightly louder than the Xperia Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Sony Xperia Z1. The quietest of the three, although it will be disappointed to have come so close to the other two and still walk away last.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Camera features fall into two categories - hardware and software features. The base is the hardware - sensor size, megapixel count, aperture size - those determine the potential of a camera. Software features are the ones that determine the level of control, ease of use, and post-processing, which is just about as important to the user experience as the hardware side of things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that the three smartphones here took part in our six-way camera and video shootout, which you should check out if you wan to know where they stand among the other cameraphones on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Looking at the hardware aspect, the Sony Xperia Z1 has the clear edge. While the LG G2 and Galaxy Note 3 utilize the standard 1/3.0" sensor size, Sony has gone with a much bigger 1/2.3" sensor, which is more commonly found in point and shoot cameras and roughly has a 70% bigger area than the others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the aperture size - a wider f/2.0 aperture means more light comes in, which could translate into better low-light images, which could give the Xperia Z1 the edge as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's optical image stabilization. Only the LG G2 has it, while the other two rely on software solutions, which don't do a particularly good job.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The OIS will help a bit with low-light photography, but without a doubt, it's more advantageous in video capturing, keeping the videos shake-free. For photos in poor lighting, a strong flash is what is needed (a wide aperture and large sensor help too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's look at the field of view. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 lens is narrowest, followed by the LG G2 and finally, the Xperia Z1 with the widest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the panorama - all three phones can do it, but the South Koreans (LG G2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3) can do spherical panoramas, too (think Photo Spheres and Google Street View).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2. The LG G2 offers OIS as well as a wide variety of cool software tricks, giving it the win here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: The Xperia Z1. The Xperia Z1 has the biggest sensor and highest megapixel count, but its camera app is rather low on features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the least advanced camera in terms of hardware and while its software backing is pretty nice, it came last here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camcorder features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now let's look at the stats sheet for video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes with the most impressive resume. It packs 2160p (or 4K) video recording with 2x lossless zoom and also has 1080p@60fps fast-motion and 720p@120fps slow motion recording to compliment the now-standard 1080p video at 30 fps. The LG G2 also has 30 and 60 fps 1080p video recording, while the Sony Xperia Z1 only features 30 fps FullHD recording, which puts it in last place, specs-wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 features the ever-evolving TouchWiz camera UI. Like many recent droids, it uses an integrated camcorder and camera interface that eliminates the need to toggle between the two. When switching to 4K mode, the Note 3 warns you that dual-shot and still images during recording would be disabled. The digital video stabilization would also be disabled, as shooting in 4K requires full use of the sensor and image chip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>LG also features an integrated camera/camcorder interface, but the G2 has a few more cool additions than its Korean counterpart from Samsung. Live Effect lets you alter the faces of people you're shooting in real time, although the resulting videos are only 480p. Tracking Zoom is a nifty feature that lets you selectively zoom into certain sections of the frame, letting you highlight important things while still showing the bigger picture. The best part is that you can relocate the preview window and zoomed-in section all while recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 gives you the same manual controls interface for the camcorder as it does for the still image camera, including scene selections, white balance, exposure controls, and shooting modes but no cool effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. 4K video recording and lossless zoom for 1080p videos make this an easy victory for the Galaxy Note 3. It's not stopping there either - HDR video and 8MP stills during video recording sweeten the deal even further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2. There's no 4K videos here, but the LG G2 at least does 1080p@60fps. It also offers Live effects, which is the coolest software feature we have here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Sony Xperia Z1. The Sony Xperia Z1 video recording capabilities max out at 1080p@30fps, which is rather low in this kind of company.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Here comes the real deal - the image quality comparison. Here are 100% zoomed-in crops from all three cameras at hand. For the Sony Xperia Z1 we used the Superior Auto mode, which uses the information from the 20.7 MP and produces oversampled 8 MP images, which should be pretty detailed and sharp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 clearly has the most detail in its images. If we get down to pixel-peeping it's evident that small elements are best resolved on the Xperia stills.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and LG G2 both shoot 13MP stills and both resolve virtually the same amount of detail. The difference comes from processing. The LG G2 tends to overexpose photos, but has more accurate colors. The Galaxy Note 3 gets the exposure right and it looks like its photos are sharper, but that's just due to a stronger sharpening filter. There is a bit more noise in the sky, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z1. The Sony flagship uses its superior sensor to produce excellent 8 MP stills, that have more detail, nicer colors and less noise than those of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runners-up: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 photos have very good detail level, though not quite as high as on the Xperia Z1. Some of that sharp feel Note 3 photos have is down to strong sharpening, which results in some artifacts in the images though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: LG G2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HDR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>High dynamic range photography is designed to help you in scenarios where there are both very bright and dark images in the frame. Instead of sacrificing one or the other, HDR helps the cameraphone resolve both by doing two or three shots and combining them in a single image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 looks pretty good here - it resolves the crane even without HDR and with it, it fills in the sky better. It leaves the shadows almost untouched, perhaps for the best - squeezing too much dynamic range could degrade contrast and produce a flat unrealistic photo with poor contrast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has big issues with this shot due to its tendency to overexpose photos. HDR mode helps a bit, but imperfect alignment of the exposures smudges out some detail in the shadows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 HDR mode does a good job of enhancing the highlights, but the foliage becomes a water painting due to either misalignment of the photos or issues in processing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Sony Xperia Z1.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Low-light<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Most photos are taken during the day, but the mark of a great camera is low-light performance. Phones are typically at a disadvantage here with their small sensors and weak flashes, but that's not the case with some of our contestants.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We broke this challenge down in two, depending on whether flash was used. Sometimes you just can't use flash, for example, if your subject is too far away - and as saw in the shootout, "too far away" is not all that far from some phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the crops we made from the best and worst photos we took with each phone. This image shows the results for both cases - flash off and on - to demonstrate what kind of difference flash makes (or fails to make). The worst shot shows how consistent a phone is, that is, can you snap just one photo with it and count on it being as good as possible.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flash off<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 had quite a hard time in this test - a large portion of the shots we took turned out blurry beyond usable and even when we picked out the best shot it was nothing spectacular - leftover noise even after heavy noise reduction that takes away most of the detail doesn't make for a great photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 has OIS, but it drops the shutter speed too much and shakiness still manages to sneak in - the worst shot is noticeably shakier than the best one. Photos don't have a lot of noise, but that's due to aggressive noise reduction, which takes its toll on fine detail too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 has the advantage of downscaling its shots - we used Superior Auto for this test. However, rven that left the low-light photos quite noisy, and lacking in detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: Sony Xperia Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flash on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The strong flash saw the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 push up from the bottom and the camera produced decent, consistent results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 flash didn't help a lot. There was next to no difference when we enabled it, except for a tiny bit of extra detail and the smartphone slid down the ranks. Things aren't as well defined as on the Note 3's photo, making the LG G2 the worst performer in this test. On one occasion the photo had a strong blue tint, though, and as luck would have it that was the best shot with the most detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 flash is not particularly powerful and turning it on helped more detail come through but there was still a lot of noise in the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: Sony Xperia Z1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: LG G2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Panorama<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 both have a spherical panorama option, but since all three phones have sweep panorama we'll compare that instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 produced a panorama with a whopping 60MP resolution with tons of detail and very little stitching artifacts (the tiles on the ground get a little messed up and so does a moving car).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 panorama is reasonably wide and the stitching looks okay, though the 6MP resolution is unbecoming of a 13MP camera and a Snapdragon 800 chipset. The biggest issue is the exposure - the phone just didn't do a good job of handling the transition from the shade behind the mall and the bright, sunlit areas.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 is finicky with panos - your panning shouldn't be too slow, but not too fast either - and it achieved the lowest resolution of the bunch, 5MP (from a 20.7MP camera and with a Snapdragon 800 doing the math, it's just poorly written software). The panorama is full of ghosting artifacts too. At least objects are roughly where they belong.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Sony Xperia Z1.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good light video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We move on to video recording and the first part of the test is naturally performance in good lighting conditions. We took our three competitors out and shot our traditional video recording test from the same place and at the same time of day. These 30 second clips are taken with minimal time in between, so as to minimize any external factors which may affect their performance differently. Let's take a look at each device in detail.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Under normal lighting conditions, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has the best camcorder on a smartphone we've ever seen. The colors are spot on, the level of detail is unparalleled, and the exposure and contrast are nailed perfectly. It even has the best dynamic range of the bunch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Note 3 also shoots in 4K, although at the expense of dual-shot mode, still image shooting while recording, and image stabilization. We took a side-by-side look at how its 4K video stacks up to 1080p, and found that the higher recording resolution really pays off when it comes to the amount of resolved detail. Below, we've rendered it alongside the 1080p video so you can get an idea of how it stacks up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG G2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>For all its great recording extras (the Tracking Zoom feature is very cool), LG seemed to have lost sight of the basics required to make a decent video recording experience. The G2's exposure is so far off that it absolutely ruins the clips, and the constant refocusing quickly goes from distracting to infuriating. The colors are more or less accurate but the exposure affects them as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia Z1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 has great potential, but ultimately ends up being doomed because of its poor contrast. If you can get past that, you'll see that the colors are accurate, the exposure is correct, and the dynamic range is rather good. There are a few issues with an overly-enthusiastic autofocus, but it's not nearly as bad as what you'll find on the G2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, we prepared a crop so you can see just how much detail the FullHD videos from all three competitors have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Even when the playing field is even and we are comparing 1080p footage the Galaxy Note 3 has a clear advantage over its competitors. And when it kicks into higher, 4K, gear the other two stand no chance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: Sony Xperia Z1. The Sony Xperia Z1 produces decent footage with good detail levels and no major weak points to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: LG G2. The LG smartphone has an overly-enthusiastic autofocus that hunts too much and ruins the clips. The exposure is also off more often than not, so the G2 is in desperate need of some fine tuning through a firmware update.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Low light video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>While things may be fine and dandy when it comes to shooting in well-lit conditions, under low light things can change drastically. Let's take a look at how things stand when the lighting is not ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a very drastic twist, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 came in dead last due to its inability to find the proper exposure and contrast under low lighting. Even its 2160p 4K resolution was not enough to salvage the lost detail. The Sony Xperia Z1 also has traces of detail in the background, but the noise reduction has smeared most of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG G2 is once again an exposure nightmare, with some badly overblown colors to boot. We lose most of the detail thanks to the camera's inability to properly expose the image under low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 has the best colors, better contrast and highest amount of detail with the lowest noise among the three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Winner: Sony Xperia Z1. The Sony smartphone really excelled in this test, resolving the most detail and not suffering the exposure issues of its peers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Runner-up: LG G2. A rather distant second, the LG G2 at least got the contrast right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Third place: Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Samsung phablet failed miserably producing videos with poor contrast and very little detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's the match of the season and the winner takes home the most coveted title. After successfully fending off the Apple iPhone 5s and the Nokia Lumia 1020 in the battle of the platforms, the LG G2 had to defend the title on its home Android turf. And was that exciting to watch - the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the Sony Xperia Z1 both spared no effort to try and knock the G2 off its high perch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Each of our three contenders brought something different to the table. The LG flagship's most potent weapons are well familiar by now. It has the most forward-thinking design that contracts the bezels to a bare minimum. Then there's the 13MP camera with optical image stabilization and LG's highly-functional UI to round off an impressive package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG G2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung is confident its Galaxy Note 3 isn't too big to turn quickly and go for the title. It brings an outstanding 5.7" Super AMOLED screen and the mighty S Pen to offer unrivaled multitasking thanks to Samsung's proprietary Multi-Window feature and 3GB of RAM. The 13 MP camera may lack OIS, but debuts 4K video recording on a smartphone, while Android 4.3 Jelly Bean is the latest available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia Z1 bets on looks, protection against the elements and a camera sensor with both size and resolution the other two just cannot match. It could use a little polishing on the software side, but there's enough hardware muscle to win the fans over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia Z1</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the smartphone market is not a one-size-fits-all affair. If you are after the ultimately most capable droid and you don't mind the size, the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is the most likely choice. Thanks to TouchWiz and the unique S Pen it offers an unmatched set of features. And that's not limited to the creative use of stylus or taking notes the old-fashioned way - the S Pen is made to count throughout the interface and takes multitasking to a whole new level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no escaping the size thing though - the Galaxy Note 3 is just too big a device to fit in every pocket. Handling and pocketability don't get much better with a big-screen high-end smartphone than the G2, so if a phablet is a no-go, the LG flagship is a an alternative you'd certainly appreciate. This one should also be the choice of those who'd like to try something new - the innovative design with buttons on the back and the knock-to wake gesture show that LG wasn't afraid to experiment and most of it has worked out excellently.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, users who value aesthetics and premium design will almost certainly pick the Sony Xperia Z1. The smartphone has the looks and high-end feel that few can match, let alone beat. The IP58 certification makes it the right device for those who enjoy adventure sports and outdoor activities - the Z1 isn't afraid to get its feet wet. And the already great camera clearly has the potential to be a star - Sony just needs to unlock it with a few software tweaks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So there you have it - these three are the best of Android, and while they compete with each other for the top spot, their target groups are different enough. It's up to you to decide which feature set suits you best, because honestly, there just isn't a wrong pick here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's always a question of trade-offs and that would be entirely your call - whether you are after the biggest possible screen or the OIS-enabled camera, the water resistance, the still photography or the better camcorder - the choices are so many that it's nauseating to weigh everything up at once. But that's part of the fun when buying one of these amazing devices. Happy shopping!</paragraph>
