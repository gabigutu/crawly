			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei is launching a new smartphone series at IFA 2016 and it's called Nova. Whether it'll shine brighter than the competition to catch the eyes of potential customers is yet unclear, but it seems that Huawei has perfected its formula for midrange devices and is happy to share it with the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ingredients for the full Huawei midrange recipe are solid - 1080p resolution and aluminum build for enhanced visual representation. Add in some extras like a fingerprint sensor and ample batteries, and you've got yourself a bunch of very competitive products.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's what's important to know about the Huawei Nova and Huawei Nova Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of that, Huawei seems not to be giving up on the tablet market and has also revealed its MediaPad M3 tablet. It builds on its predecessor's high-end specs and here's what it's all about.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Nova hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>From the very first time your eyes land on the Huawei Nova, you just can't help but appreciate the view. The aluminum unibody and the beautiful way the screen just curves to the sides ever so gently quickly suggest that Huawei means business and is eager to win the midrange beauty contest if there was one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, beauty is subject to personal preference, but certain traits are universally accepted as being pretty, and the Huawei Nova ticks most of them. The company has apparently drawn inspiration from the Nexus 6P and at the back there's a similar dark glass around the camera lens spanning the width of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This handsome hardware wraps a 5" IPS display of 1080p resolution, hinting at an upper midrange status. We don't know if it's covered with a layer of Gorilla Glass for extra protection, though. Under the hood roars a Snapdragon 625 chipset with an octa-core 2.0GHz Cortex-A53 CPU and 3GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is the go-to combination for manufacturers and their midrange offerings these days. It's common for a reason, and it's the balance between price and performance. However, we didn't notice any hiccups on the company's latest Emotion UI 4.1 running on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Behind the nice looking dark glass at the back lies a 12MP camera with an f/2.2 aperture, 1.5&#x3bc;m pixel size, hybrid autofocus, PDAF+ contrast detection. It even records 4K video. At the front, there's an 8MP front-facing camera with Perfect Makeup mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3,020mAh battery is good for almost two days of frequent use (as per Huawei's account), but there's no fast charging support, which is somewhat of a letdown. Nevertheless, you get additional features to balance it out such as a snappy fingerprint sensor, USB Type-C, and a microSD card slot available only on the single-SIM model.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Nova launches in the fall and will be available in Prestige Gold, Titanium Gray and Moonlight Silver. The phone will be available from early October for ?399.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Nova Plus hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>By its moniker alone, you can safely assume the Nova Plus is the oversized version of the Nova. In reality, they don't have too much in common, at least not on the outside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can safely look at the Huawei Nova Plus as the international version of the G9 Plus. The 5.5" display is of 1080p resolution, and while the front looks similar to the Nova, the back is another matter entirely. It's made of aluminum as well, but the camera has a bump and is placed in the center, right above the fingerprint sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera itself is a 16MP unit with optical image stabilization, dual-LED flash and 1.12µm pixel size. It can also record 4K videos with ease.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: We managed to snap a few camera samples with one of the IFA units:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chipset is similar to the Huawei Nova, but has 4GB of RAM and thanks to the larger body the battery is a 3,340mAh unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Expect the Nova Plus to become available sometime in September with a ?429 price tag.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Huawei MediaPad M3 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei also revealed its latest slate, the MediaPad M3. The tablet will have the hard task of conquering space for itself on your couch, where typically the iPad has resided for a while now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei's plan for the MediaPad M3 is making it light and particularly good at watching videos. To do so, the 8.4" display has a 2560x1600 pixels resolution and Harman Kardon-certified stereo speakers with high-resolution audio support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Driving the media consumption train is Huawei's Kirin 950 chipset with octa-core CPU and 4GB of RAM. Storage is either 32GB or 64GB, depending on the model you choose. All of them have microSD card slots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the battery is a 5,100mAh unit. It's not much, but will be enough for a full day of movie watching. The camera pair is 8MP on the front and back for the moments that you absolutely don't want to miss.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei MediaPad M3 will launch in Western Europe, including the UK, on September 26. The base 32GB Wi-Fi model will cost ?349, whereas the 64GB Wi-Fi model will cost ?399. That's also the price of the 32GB LTE model. The most expensive is the 64GB LTE variant, which will retail for ?449.</paragraph>
