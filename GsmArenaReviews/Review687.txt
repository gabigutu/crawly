		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 is touted as a PROselfie smartphone but it could've easily been missed in a growing crowd of handsets boasting high-res wide-angle front cams. Sony's first 5MP front-facer with a 25mm wide-angle lens sure took a while, yet latecomer Xperia C3 is keen to jump the queue. It's one of the few to offer a LED flash on the front, taking selfie photography to the next level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As a midrange package, the Sony Xperia C3 looks nearly spot-on. The 5.5" IPS display of 720p resolution is enhanced by the Sony Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2, while the Snapdragon 400 chipset with four Cortex-A7s clocked at 1.2GHZ and 1GB of RAM must've been an easy pick. The Xperia C3 comes in two flavors: one with LTE connectivity and a dual-SIM version that's said to have dual-call support, still quite a rare option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear camera of the Sony Xperia C3 got none of the special treatment the front cam received. The Xperia C3 has the 8MP ExmorRS BSI sensor that has been the popular choice in Sony's midrange since the original Xperia C. This time around, it is paired with an even more powerful LED flash, so it will hopefully do better in low-light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's check out the complete feature list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bezels are perhaps the biggest issue of an otherwise pretty good design. Above the screen, the upgraded front cam complete with an LED flash is a pretty good excuse, but the unused space below the screen is hard to explain. The selfie cam cannot shoot Full HD video and this is another questionable decision.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Otherwise, the Snapdragon 400 is still capable of pulling its weight and the choice between LTE and Dual-SIM is boosting the pair's prospects. We are reviewing the Dual SIM flavor of the smartphone, but in terms of looks and functionally, the two models are identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, without further ado we are ready to unbox this Xperia C3 and see what happens next. Shall we?</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Sony Xperia C3 Dual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia C3 retail package is perhaps too big for what it actually offers. The basics are duly taken care of, but that's about it. You get an A/C adapter, a microUSB cable and a standard headset with an integrated mic.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia C3 Dual 360-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With a 5.5" IPS display, the Xperia C3 is obviously a large handset and we've seen better use of space and screen-to-surface ratios. The Meizu MX Pro 4, for instance, is a very good, and recent, reference. On a positive note, the Xperia C3 is slimmer. At 156.2 x 78.7 x 7.6mm, it is 1cm taller than a 5.5" LG G3 and about the size of an iPhone 6 Plus, which however has a hardware Home button / fingerprint scanner. The Xperia C3 weighs a reasonable 150g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>True, the Xperia C3's bezels are not flagship grade but being a midrange device after all, it can get away with that easier than most. It's actually on par with the 5.5" HTC Desire 820, which is a direct competitor.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We've seen the Sony Xperia C3 design used on other Xperia smartphones a couple of generations already. Although the next flagship can probably do with at least a facelift, the OmniBalance design still works just fine for the more affordable models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C3 is looks more than reasonable and is probably slimmer than most in its price bracket. It's a pleasure to handle and easily recognizable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3's has a large 5.5" Triluminos HD screen but the highlight at the front is, of course, the PROselfie 5MP camera and the accompanying LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the two grilles above and below the screen might look as stereo speakers, they are in fact standing for the earpiece and the primary microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chassis of the Xperia C3 is made of plastic, with a glossy silver trim around the edges. Those give the looks a huge boost even though they are prone to fingerprints.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The non-removable rear cover of the Sony Xperia C3 is made of matte plastic, typical of the mid-range Xperia lineup. It is fingerprint-proof and has excellent grip.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 is big and while its UI provides some options for single-handed use, it is best navigated using both hands. The slim profile and lightweight body (for the size) make it quite comfortable to hold and pocket. There's more than sufficient grip so you'll have no worries handling the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The 5.5" IPS display of 720p resolution occupies most of the Xperia C3's front, though its rather big bezels make for an unimpressive screen-to-body ratio of 67.8%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, most people would be interested into the 5MP selfie camera with LED flash, which is a rather conspicuous circle next to the Sony logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The earpiece is around, carved out of the screen's protective glass above the Sony logo and hidden under a proper grille. Above the screen we also find a couple of hidden sensors and the status LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The grille below the screen isn't a speaker as its looks might suggest. This is where the primary microphone is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side is where we find the microUSB port and the microSD card slot under its own plastic cap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is very crowded. First - another plastic cap covers the SIM bed - it can either accommodate one or two micro-SIM cards, depending on the model you've chosen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next come the round Power/Lock key made of metal, followed by a small plastic volume rocker and a two-step camera shutter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the Xperia C3 is the 3.5mm audio jack, while the bottom is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP Exmor RS camera lens is on the back, accompanied by a LED flash and the secondary microphone used either for stereo audio recording or active noise cancellation in calls. The huge loudspeaker grille is also at the back, near the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The matte rear cover is non removable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 flaunts a 5.5" IPS Triluminos display of 720p resolution, which works out to 267ppi. While this is nowhere near the 400+ pixel density of current flagships, the C3 is in an entirely different price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C3's display is enhanced by Sony's Mobile BRAVIA 2 engine. It aims to improve sharpness, reduce noise, while boosting contrast and saturation, and it does a pretty good job of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Triluminous display tech means expanded color gamut with supposedly more vivid reds and natural-looking greens and blues.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is standard RGB with an equal amount of green, red and blue pixels in line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen contrast and brightness are very good, and so is color reproduction, all adding up to excellent image quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The viewing angles, thanks to the IPS matrix, are better than average. There is no significant loss of contrast or color washing when you look the screen at an angle, though there is noticeable color shift from some directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Using the Sony Xperia C3 outdoors in the brief but bright winter daylight turned out quite a trouble-free experience. It isn't among the best we've seen, but it does well indeed.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony has put a 2,500mAh battery inside the Xperia C3 Dual. We ran our battery test routine with the battery-saving STAMINA mode off. The handset scored 91 hours, which means you can count on just shy of 4 days if you do an hour each of talk-time, web browsing and playing video per day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We re-ran our battery test with just a single SIM card to test the singe-SIM Xperia C3 battery endurance - and the result it managed was also 91 hours. The standby endurance was very close to what we've measured with two active SIM cards that it wasn't enough to make an impact on our final endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically, as soon as the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also choose to automatically turn Wi-Fi off if there is no known Wi-Fi network in range or switch off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating. Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 comes in single and dual SIM flavors. Both models offer quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support. LTE is the single SIM model's key strength and comes in penta-band options. The Dual SIM model only has 3G on SIM1, SIM2 is GSM/EDGE-capable only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrary to what advertisements claim, our Xperia C3 dual lacked the promised dual-call support. The phone only supported dual stand-by. While you are in a call on one of the SIM cards, the other one is inaccessible for incoming calls. You can setup the phone to forward calls from the inaccessible card to the active one, but that's not Dual Call functionality. We certainly hope it's a regional thing and not a malfunction or anything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity features include single-band Wi-Fi b/g/n and Wi-Fi Direct. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.0, GPS and GLONASS, plus an FM radio with RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also NFC connectivity with support for Android Beam for sending files to other Android devices. There's no IR port, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The ultra-low power ANT+ connectivity protocol handles connections to various sports accessories such as heart rate monitors or bicycle speed &amp; cadence meters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a microUSB 2.0 port for charging and data connections. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory and microSD card over the USB cable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB 2.0 port can also be used in On-the-go mode for connecting USB peripherals such as keyboards or USB flash drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port doesn't have any TV-out functionality, but if you own a compatible HDTV, you can output your phone's screen wirelessly via the Miracast protocol or Sony's Xperia Connectivity Throw option. The app allows you to share your media through DLNA by creating a media server and connect to a PlayStation DUALSHOCK 3 (or 4) wireless controller.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android KitKat sweeten with Xperia flavor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 comes with Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box. The launcher looks identical to what you would see on any other KitKat Xperia smartphone, like the Xperia E3 we recently reviewed. If you aren't familiar with it, you can check out this quick video below to get you up to speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the usual affair - it supports widgets (one per pane), while the rightmost pane will fire up the camera. There are a few available default widgets, but you can always get more from the Play Store. Also third party apps oftentimes come with their own set of extra widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five homescreen panels by default and you can set any of them as your primary one. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set various live and static wallpapers, add widgets and shortcut, or change the UI theme. You can also choose which icons will be visible on the status bar, and which should remain hidden.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area lists notifications in the default tab with a separate tab for Quick Settings. You can gain quick access to the Quick Settings tab with a two-finger swipe from the top. The toggles are customizable and you can choose between 20+ different toggles and have up to 12 of them visible in their dedicated page. Holding a finger over any toggle will give you direct access to its menu listing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you enable the one-hand operation gestures from the Settings menu, you can tap twice on the Home key and the Notification area will automatically drop down, with its entire interface closer to your fingertips. Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus does pretty much the same thing with their Reachability feature, though it works across their entire UIs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C3 uses the stock Android task manager that lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called "small apps" are also available in the Xperia C3 and are accessible via the task manager. They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app. So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Recorder. You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or use the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget. Sadly, you can't disable the small apps entirely and will always have them cramming your recent apps whether you use them or not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in 8GB of storage gets filled up pretty quickly and the Xperia C3 needed a microSD card to help carry the load. And while we quickly obliged and moved the images, videos and other multimedia files over to the card, apps were harder to move. You can transfer most of the built-in and all of the downloaded apps into the external memory but that would take you precious time and digging through the menus.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T3 makes use of the Snapdragon 400 mid-range chipset. It has four Cortex-A7 CPU cores ticking at 1.2 GHz, Adreno 305 graphics and 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've already seen the Snapdragon 400 powering a plenty of devices in the last year or so and it is indeed good enough for hiccup free use, though it's time is running out already. Many manufacturers are already replacing the Snapdragon 400 with its newer iteration - Snapdragon 410, which offers a 64-bit processor, which is more in line with where the industry is heading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with the CPU benchmarks, the Xperia C3 posted a rather poor result on the multi-core GeekBench 3 cross-platform benchmark. It managed to do the same as the Moto G (2014), but other Snapdragon 400-powered devices such as the Xiaomi Redmi 1S and Sony Xperia T3 are doing even better. Their processor clock is higher though.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AnTuTu is a compound benchmark, which also takes into account RAM and GPU performance. The Xperia C3 numbers are average, close to what's expected from an S400-running device. Naturally, the octa-core Redmi Note and Desire 820 are notably better.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark OS II is another all-round benchmark. It gives an overall score along with single, multi-core performance, math performance and more. We focus on the overall score and the dedicated CPU scores. The Sony Xperia C3 overall rating is on par with other Snapdragon 400 phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi 1S and Redmi Note.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single and multi-core scores are average, mostly because the processors in the other Snapdragon 400 phones run on a higher clock.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS II (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics benchmark results came out average. The GFXBench tests - both off-screen and on-screen variants - reflected some OK performance on par with the competition. Note that the Open GL ES 3.0 Manhattan 1080p offscreen test failed to run because of insufficient video memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Adreno 305 is a capable GPU, but the quad-core Mali-450MP4 within the Xiaomi Redmi Note is obviously better and doubles the performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 2.7 T-Rex (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mozilla's Kraken 1.1 is JavaScript-centric browser benchmark. The Sony Xperia C3 did poorly on this test yet better than the new Moto G (2014). Unfortunately, the HTML5 BrowserMark 2.1 test crashed each time we tried to run it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing is clear, the Sony Xperia C3 isn't acing any benchmarks. On the contrary - its raw performance is average at best, barely touching some of its competitors. On a positive note - the synthetic benchmark performance may not be a complete measure for the device performance as in real-life use we found it to operate quite well. It provides solid and smooth Android experience and will do OK for the occasional game.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, heavier 3D games may not run well or at all because of insufficient RAM or will results in performance bottlenecks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C3 is OK for the moment and if you don't intend to use it for more than web browsing, watching the occasional video, listening to music, or playing some Angry Birds, and, of course, messaging and calls, then you'd be good for quite a while.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 phonebook is integrated with the dialer using a tabbed interface - the Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs can be side-swiped. The contact list has a dedicated search filed plus it offers and an alphabetical scroll bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are using two SIM cards, every time you want to make a call you'll be asked to choose which SIM card to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking contacts is available, quick contact feature is here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual SIM telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 Dual was able to hold onto signal very well. Calls remained uninterrupted and the sound quality was okay. Voices came out loud enough. Clarity wasn't the best but it was okay nonetheless.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer support smart dialing and if you are using two SIM cards it will come with two call keys, one for each SIM card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Dual SIM manager is within the Settings menu. There you can name the SIM cards, choose the default one for internet data and you can also opt for Dual SIM Reachability. Since Xperia C3 Dual doesn't support dual-call as advertized, Dual SIM Reachability activates call forwarding between the SIMs for the times, when one of your cards is in a call or inaccessible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3's loudspeaker was only Average. It scored average voice and pink noise tests and a good ringing phone test so it shouldn't be an issue to hear alerts and incoming calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has preloaded a number of features that modify how the speaker sounds. We tested with all of them, but besides the proprietary xLOUD, the rest made very little to no difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message automatically into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the Gmail client and the default Email apps are onboard. Gmail can sync only with (multiple) Google accounts, while the generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia E3 offers a customizable on-screen full QWERTY keyboard. You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled. Different keyboard skins are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before, you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Single-hand size keyboard is available too, but only in portrait orientation. If enabled, it squeezes the onscreen keyboard to the left or right side of the screen so it gets more comfortable for single handed text input.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Album<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We should all be familiar with Sony's custom gallery - Album. It organizes images into groups of thumbnails and sorts them by date. You can change the thumbnails size by pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike previous versions there isn't a homepage that hosts all of your albums, instead you get the same navigation drawer as in app drawer is offering. There you can find all of your online and offline albums.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery can connect to online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) and also to other devices on the local network. Maps and Globe albums are also available, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia smartphones. It features Music Unlimited integration and is not above trying to sell you songs, but you can hide the Music Unlimited stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman interface is based on a hidden swipe-able menu that sort your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to connect the player with your Facebook account). You can pop up the menu the same way you'd do it in the app drawer or the gallery - just swipe from the left edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Unlimited stuff includes ways to discover new music - Charts, New releases and Channels. Those can be hidden individually (same goes for the artist/album/playlist tiles) or you can disable the service altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infinite button is available in the Now Playing screen (just tap the album art) - it will help you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman player offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ option is here, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in volume between tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements contain yet more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Then there's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD boosts up the internal speaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's also an FM Radio. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Movies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this doesn't work very well for TV shows - it doesn't recognize the S01E02 naming convention and it won't pull info about individual episodes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 was able to handle videos up to 1080p resolution. It had issues with the AC-3 audio codec and failed to load sound in videos carrying it but that's mostly normal for smartphones these days. MKV movies went through, but with no sound because of their AC-3 audio codec.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player comes with subtitle support by default, the only requirement is both file names (video and subtitles) to be the identical.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is clean, but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 Dual did fairly well in our audio quality test, demonstrating clean output in the two test scenarios.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual we did the first test with the smartphone connected to an active external amplifier and it produced some very good scores. The Xperia C3 Dual showed no weak points to its performance, except for the volume which was below-par.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones causes a very moderate spike in the stereo crosstalk and also adds some intermodulation distortion - neither of the problems is too easy to detect unless you have a very well trained ear. The volume levels are once again the main problem with the output - the smartphone will certainly struggle with more demanding headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then again, if you own such headphones and are willing to pay the price that comes with them you probably aren't shopping in the price bracket that the Xperia C3 Dual inhabits. And within its own competition, the smartphone does pretty well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Average 8MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3's camera uses one of Sony's standard-issue 8MP Exmor RS sensor. It shoots with a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels (8MP) in manual and Superior Auto modes. There is also a LED flash to help you with some low-light photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C3 also has a hardware shutter key, which you can set up to unlock the phone and start the camera. It can also snap a photo or start capturing video immediately. This might come in handy for those occasions when you want to capture something quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes and is unified with the camcorder one - you can snap a photo or shoot a video without changing modes most of the times. Depending on the shooting mode you're in, the video shutter key may be replaced by a still/video mode toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the full resolution Manual mode you also get access to "manual controls" on the viewfinder, which sounds more impressive than it really is. There's an exposure compensation slider and a white balance selector. You can also control the ISO, metering and focus modes, turn on/off image stabilization, but those are buried in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Superior Auto shooting mode is what we've already seen in other Xperia phones. There are no settings you can change, everything here is done automagically. Unlike the 20MP Sony Xperia phones, the images taken with Superior Auto have the same quality as the one shot in Normal (Manual) mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual and Superior Auto aside, the Xperia C3 offers several other interesting shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Sweep panorama but, unfortunately, panoramas come out with 5MP resolution, lousy stitching and uninspiring quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs real-life visual cues in the scene to track your motion). Children will love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes include the regular Picture effect mode, which creates a 3 x 3 grid that shows all the available effects in real time. Sony has also included a mode called Social streaming, which can live-stream the video feed from your camera directly on your Facebook profile. That's certainly not something you see every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Timeshift replaces the regular burst mode, it captures 30 shots in just 2 seconds. The intriguing thing is it starts shooting even before you've pressed the shutter button.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both 8MP samples taken on Superior Auto and Manual mode came with underwhelming level of resolved detail when viewed at 1:1 magnification. The exposure, contrast and colors are good, which makes for nice looking photos when you view them fit on your screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But getting any closer shows that the noise reduction algorithm has taken its toll on the fine detail, while the noise still remains high in some images. Furthermore, there are significant oversharpening artifacts visible. The dynamic range is low, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the 8MP shots we've snapped in Superior Auto:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are a few samples taken in Manual mode. They have the same quality as the 8MP ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR more is a bit hard to find, but it is present on the Sony Xperia C3. You need to go to Manual mode first, then in the Scenes Menu and then you should select Backlight Correction (HDR). The HDR mode is conservative and rescues both the highlights and shadows without going to extremes. Unfortunately, the resolved detail is even worse than in the standard samples.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of HDR samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've also snapped two photos with the front 5MP snapper. Unfortunately, the detail is also on the low side, the fixed focus isn't doing it a favor because most of the selfie samples (of the mouse) we took weren't on focus either.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>We uploaded the full resolution 8MP photos to our photo quality comparison database to compare against other high-resolution smartphones. The image quality - resolved detail, noise, colors and contrast - are below average.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording done in 1080p at 30 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 is capable of capturing 1080p video at 30fps. The camcorder shares the same UI as the still camera. You can set a timer and fiddle with settings like exposure, metering, focus mode, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For videos the Xperia C3 features a proprietary SteadyShot digital image stabilization, but there's a price to pay - the field of view (FoV) is reduced (it's how all digital stabilization systems work). The phone is smart enough to detect whether you are shooting hand-held or you have rested it on something stable but you get the reduced FoV either way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go into video mode from the Manual shooting mode, you get an HDR option, as well as various preset scenes to pick from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also snap stills during video recording but that's not of much use as you only get 1080p images, you might as well grab a frame from the video later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 Dual's 1080p samples are nothing to rave about, but they are still better than the still images. The resolved detail is better, the noise reduction isn't that destructive and there is very little noise. The frame rate is steady at 28 fps, while the bitrate is good at 16-17Mbps with stereo sound recording with a bitrate of 128 Kbps and 48 kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, our Xperia C3 had some issues with its audio capturing during the video and it is rather unusable. Hopefully, this is just an issue with our (retail!) unit, not a wide-spread one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The continuous autofocus is much too eager and triggers way too often as on other Xperia phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 1080p sample, which we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia C3 is also capable of capturing 1080p@30fps HDR videos. The quality is the same as the standard video samples, the HDR effect is barely visible sometimes, and sometimes way too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out the HDR samples we've uploaded on YouTube as well.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 captures mediocre 1080p videos. It manages to resolve good detail in our resolution chart test and under good light conditions, but there is lots of noise and artefacts when shooting in low-light rooms.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia C3 comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other pre-installed apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia C3 also features the Office Suite 8, which allows for creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt), and it can also read PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calculator, Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer), Sketch and File Manager apps are available by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Socialife app comes pre-installed too. It is a service similar to Samsung's My Magazine and HTC One's Blinkfeed. The interface is clean and simple yet beautiful, and there are lots of preloaded feeds. You can add your own RSS links too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's New app has very beautiful UI and will show you the hottest apps and multimedia today, but it isn't limited to the Play Store only. It'll display content from Sony's PlayStation store too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Select does the same as the Sony's What's New app, but comes with much less functions and old UI. We feel Sony should retire it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet Google Maps and Navigation are also part of the app package to utilize the built-in GPS receiver (with added GLONASS support). Offline maps are available, again, since the last update, so you can save some data traffic too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever you may be missing, there is the always-growing Google Play Store for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia C3 Dual key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Build quality is great, but design-wise, we find the screen bezels a bit too wide</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display quality and sunlight legibility are very good</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery life is great, whether it's the dual-SIM version or not</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We rated the speaker loudness as Average</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clean and user-friendly interface, feature-rich multimedia apps - Album, Movies, Walkman</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The benchmark performance is good for the market segment, but comparatively slightly worse than the competition with the same chipset</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The audio quality is good</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera takes average photos, but good quality videos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5MP front snapper image quality is disappointing, and it doesn't offer 1080p video</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player supports subtitles and all video formats but WMV, it also lacks AC3 audio decoding</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A beefed up selfie-cam is probably a good way to jazz things up without a massive investment. No wonder we've been seeing much of them in the midrange.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front LED flash narrows the list of potential competitors to just a few names. The likes of the HTC Desire Eye and the Oppo N-series don't really count here. The Sony Xperia C3 is clearly in a lower league but it's exactly the place where a selfie cam can be a key selling point. Even more so if paired with an LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To its credit, the Sony Xperia C3 has more than just a rare front-facer to offer. It comes with an ample 5.5" IPS display and decently sharp too. It lets you choose between LTE and dual-SIM support. The Snapdragon 400 keeps up with Android 4.4 KitKat for a reasonably smooth user experience overall. You get more than decent battery life and adequate inbuilt storage topped up with a memory card slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And it's not like Sony had to work too hard on this particular package. It's pretty much an Xperia T3 with an upgraded front camera. To be fair, it's a substantial upgrade on paper but the 5MP camera fails to impress - with or without the LED flash. The image quality is underwhelming and the added apps and features don't make a big difference. The lack of Full HD video recording doesn't help its case either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Xperia C3 is decently equipped to stand its ground in the midrange and has a unique marketable feature. Whether it's more than just a gimmick is arguable but it's true that a high-res wide-angle front cam with an LED flash is still a rare combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Very few can match the front LED flash and we really don't think comparisons to the Desire Eye or Oppo's swivel camera would be fair. A couple of more likely competitors on the other hand don't look too capable of challenging the Xperia C3 either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Lava Iris X5 ? Acer Liquid E3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although a phone - and not a phablet - the Nokia Lumia 735 is more likely to upset Sony's plans. It too is powered by a S400 chipset and comes with smaller but therefore sharper AMOLED screen - with a 720p resolution on a 4.7 diagonal. A little cheaper than its Android counterparts as usual, the Microsoft-powered handset offers wireless charging and a 5MP front camera that's supposedly Skype-optimized for all that may be worth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 735</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 816 dual packs a 5.5" display of 720p resolution, runs on a Snapdragon 400 chipset and offers better rear and front cameras. It doesn't come with a front LED, but it does better when it comes to selfie features, it has more RAM and a faster processor, stereo front speakers and a bigger battery, though slightly worse real-life battery performance. The Desire 816 comes in a single-SIM LTE and dual-SIM 3G flavor as well. They cost the same as the Xperia C3 pair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Desire 816 dual sim ? HTC Desire 816</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently unveiled Samsung Galaxy E7 is quite attractive with its polycarbonate unibody and the 5.5" Super AMOLED display. The chipset is the newer Snapdragon 410 with 64-bit processing, the RAM amount is also higher at 2GB. For an extra ?40 you also get a better 13MP rear cam and a much bigger battery in a smaller and lightweight body. A dual-SIM option is available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy E7</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lenovo Vibe X2 is a beautiful smartphone with a layered magnesium unibody. It has a smaller 5" IPS display but of higher 1080p resolution, runs on a more powerful chipset with an octa-core processor and better graphics. It's an LTE-enabled dual-SIM package. The camera department is superior and there's 32GB of internal storage, but no microSD card slot. It costs about the same as a Sony Xperia C3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Lenovo Vibe X2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi Note is a dual-SIM smartphones with a 5.5" IPS screen of 720p resolution. It's also powered by Snapdragon 400 and boasts a bigger battery, a superior rear camera, and the MIUI launcher is just great. The Redmi Note costs about ?80 less than the Xperia C3, and while you'll lose the front LED flash, you'll gain a lot more in features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Xiaomi Redmi Note 4G</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The recently announced Meizu m1 note sounds just great on paper with a 5.5" 1080p screen, a MT6752 chip with an octa-core CPU, powerful graphics and 2GB of RAM. A 5MP front facer complements the primary 13MP camera. The handset is powered by a massive 3,140mAh battery and has both LTE connectivity and dual-SIM support. All that at nearly half the price of an Xperia C3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Meizu m1 note</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like we said, the Sony Xperia T3 is more or less the same package and now slightly cheaper. Other than the front cam, everything else is the same: the LTE connectivity, the screen, the Snapdragon 400 chipset, the rear 8MP camera, even the stellar battery life. There is no dual-SIM flavor though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia T3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We get that the front camera with LED flash is a feature that can easily be pitched to a specific audience. And with the Xperia C3, there's plenty for Sony's marketing to work with. But it's hard to see the added value for many users - especially since the image quality of the front snapper was a letdown.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even without counting the front snapper, the Xperia C3 is solid enough midrange package. But it's in the midrange that the competition gets really tough. So it will be a tough road ahead for this one.</paragraph>
