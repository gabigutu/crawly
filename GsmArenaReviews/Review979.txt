			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei are making sure they're taken seriously as a phone maker. They're actually well past the newcomer stage and, with a market the size of China behind them, Huawei's appetite will only be growing bigger to compete with the establishment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei didn't start with a bang, there was - inevitably - a stage of copying and imitation, but we found some of its phones to be quite good - reasonably priced alternatives of existing devices by major manufacturers, and not without some nice custom touches either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the Chinese have proved to be fast learners in smartphones, the Ascend Mate is perhaps a throwback to their early days of mixing and matching. The Mate is the Chinese take on the Samsung Galaxy Notes - low-cost but quite up to date in terms of equipment, for a midrange phablet that is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And by the way, they might just be doing things right. Samsung's Mega 6.3 is probably in equal measures an attempt to make the Note experience available to the masses and a response to genuinely affordable, and seemingly quite competitive, products like the Huawei Ascend Mate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, this is Huawei's first foray into phablets but the Chinese have a handful of smartphones and tablets under their belt which, at least on paper, are no worse than the competition's flagships. A crossover was only a matter of time obviously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's success with the Note, followed by LG and their Optimus G Pro, swung the door wide open for the smaller brands to start exploring the phablet form factor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate is a prominent figure in this trend and its 6.1" screen sees it squeezed between two serious rivals, the Samsung Mega pair. It's worth noting though, that Huawei were well ahead of Samsung in announcing their device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like most of the latest generation of Huawei devices, the Ascend Mate is powered by the company's home-brewed K3V2 chip. That's probably not top-of-the-line technology, but four Cortex-A9 CPU cores clocked at 1.5GHz and a 16-core GPU, is the same combo powering their current 1080p-screen flagship, Ascend D2. It should be more than capable to keep Android running glitch-free at 720p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate has got some special software treatment too. The gadget is running Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean, but it's been seriously redesigned with Huawei's own Emotion UI for a clean and simple user interface that omits an app drawer and keeps the widgets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll get to into the details in due course - the hardware checkup is first on our list. Hit the next page to get a better feel of the Huawei Ascend Mate.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Ascend Mate<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate's retail package offered no surprises - the device comes with the essential accessories in the shape of an A/C adapter, a USB cable, and a headset, along with the usual paperwork.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Huawei Ascend Mate 360-degree-view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate measures 163.5 x 85.7 x 9.9 mm, which is about the size of a Galaxy Mega 6.3, only thicker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend Mate's weight is about the same though - 198g.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's not the added millimeters around the waist though, that you will actually feel in terms of handling. The Huawei Ascend Mate is more angular and boxy, and therefore, a bit less comfortable to hold. The styling however is superior to that of the Mega 6. 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are happy with the matte finish of the back. It's nice to the touch and doesn't get covered in fingerprints, along with having a non-slip feel. Sure, the flat sides and angular shape of the phablet render it a bit less comfortable to hold than the curved Mega 6.3, but this design has its advantages too. For one, a readily accessible memory card slot is most welcome, and the extra thickness has allowed room for a massive battery, which is one of the highlights of the Chinese phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front has rather generic looks but there's little they could've done about it. Trying to be creative could've easily backfired at this size. That said, Huawei has managed to keep the footprint as small as possible by reducing the bezel (the screen covers 73% of the front). Another thing that helps usability is the customized UI that offers one-hand mode (it's similar to Samsung's solution of squeezing the keyboard and dialer horizontally to make buttons easier to reach).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is covered with Gorilla Glass, actual generation not specified, and there're no navigation controls whatsoever, regular buttons or capacitive keys. The Android controls are on-screen only, placed on an auto-hiding navigation bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate has dark-chrome trimming running all around the sides that goes well with the angular styling of the handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mate will fit in a pant pocket easily, but it's the kind of device that will certainly make its presence felt - to begin with, you wouldn't be too comfortable sitting down with the phablet in your pocket. A device this big - and one that weighs a solid 200g too - will take some time getting used to, but single-handed use isn't entirely out of the question. After all, most people will be there for the screen size and they should be well prepared what to expect.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is a lot going on above the display: the earpiece is covered with a protective grille, with a status LED in its left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1MP front camera is near the top right corner of the device, with proximity and ambient light sensors nearby.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is nothing of interest below the display, since all of the controls are now part of the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker and the Power/Lock key are positioned on the right side of the Huawei Ascend Mate. There is no dedicated camera key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Ascend Mate features the hot-swappable microSD card slot, sealed by a plastic flap.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the Huawei Ascend Mate we have the 3.5mm audio jack, microSIM slot and the secondary microphone. The mic pinhole is so close to the SIM slot that it can be easily mistaken for a SIM eject hole, especially with the SIM pictogram right above it. Well, it's not, so don't try to stick a pin in it. The SIM compartment works exactly like the memory card slot - undo the flap with a fingernail and push the card to eject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB /charging port is at the Ascend Mate's bottom. The primary microphone is right next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8 megapixel camera lens is centrally placed at the top of Ascend Mate's back. The single-LED flash is around too. You can spot the loudspeaker grille in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate is fed by a 4050 mAh battery, and the tinge of disappointment at it being a non-removable unit soon gave way to cheer. It walked out of our battery as the only device that has ever matched the current champion. With a rating of 81 hours the Huawei Mate is easily the new standard-setter, considering the Motorola RAZR MAXX is well past its prime now.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate flaunts a 6.1" IPS+ LCD of 720p resolution, which works out to 241ppi. While this is nowhere near the 400+ pixel density of current flagships, we should not forget that it's a completely different price range we're talking about. The Ascend Mate beats a direct rival in the face of the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate's screen offers very good viewing angles with no color shift and only slight contrast loss when looking at the display at an a angle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The brightness control in the notification area is a single virtual key with four steps: Automatic, 100%, 50% and 0% brightness. There's no brightness slider as in competing Android devices. There is an additional Smart Backlight toggle in the Display Settings - this could be On or Off and we're not sure how it affects the image quailty.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Jelly Bean, Emotion UI 1.5 and no app drawer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate runs Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean skinned with the home-brewed Emotion UI v1.5. The result is a very simple, flat interface with no app drawer. It seems, it was Huawei's goal to make it friendly and simple rather than rework Android beyond recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the missing app drawer and the collapsible navigation bar, the rest is pretty straightforward and familiar, with most of the applications being the stock Android apps, with subtle Huawei touches here and there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a demo video of the user interface to get you started:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is fairly busy. At its center is a circle with shortcuts in the four cardinal directions: simple unlock to the south, camera to the north, messaging to the east and dialer/call log to the west.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The upper area of the lockscreen displays the time and date. If the music player is running, the time and date are replaced by the music player controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is a fairly standard Android homescreen with five customizable shortcuts docked at the bottom. The default selection is phone app, messages, mail, web browser and contacts but you can have any app really, or folders with multiple items, visible on all homescreens.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are nine homescreen panes at most - at least a couple of them will accommodate actual apps. In the absence of an app drawer, anything you install pops up on the homescreen. There're no shortcuts as such -the usual routine of removing icons (dragging them up to a recycle bin at the top of the screen) will uninstall the corresponding app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing is fool-proof and you just can't accidentally uninstall essential apps like the gallery or email client.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The downside of the flat structure is you cannot get rarely used apps out of the way, but folders partially make up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A pinch on the homescreen triggers the familiar Overview mode to let you check out and organize the homescreen panes currently in use, remove or add panes as you please. Alternatively, the overview can be displayed when you hit the Thumbnails shortcut in the menu that appears upon a tap and hold on a blank spot of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Widgets are available too - tap and hold on the homescreen, then choose Widgets. The Ascend Mate came only with the default Jelly Bean widgets, no custom additions by Huawei. Of course, you can get third party widgets off the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The menu displayed upon a tap and hold on the homescreen also lets you set wallpaper and homescreen transition effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Live, static and scrollable static wallpapers are supported. You can activate the Shake to change wallpaper setting, or turn on Random change and set a specific time interval (5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, and every day).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Themes are available as well. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system icons, system font and the sound profile. There are 24 different lockscreen styles with different unlock gestures, time widgets and shortcut style and layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you can always opt for the default Android lockscreens - Face Unlock, Pattern, PIN or Password.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also 20 completely different icon sets you can choose from, including some really... creative ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features up to nine toggles on a single side-swipeable row. Hitting More will reveal all the available toggles and you can choose which of the 15 toggles in total will feature on the top row.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard Android notifications stack up below the toggles. The notifications can be expanded or collapsed with a pinch gesture. You can also swipe to dismiss a notification.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A shortcut to the Settings Menu and a Dismiss All button are available in the top right corner of the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the Music Player or FM radio apps are running in background, media player controls will be available in the notification area too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first toggle on the notification area is Profiles. Upon a tap, a virtual dial appears to choose the setting you need: Normal, Outdoor, Meeting, or Sleep. Each of them has predefined settings - you can't have your own presets or customize the available ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings menu has two tabs. The first one is called General and offers only a limited set of settings Huawei thought you'll use most often.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other tab - All Settings - has the default Android list of settings plus a few extra additions by Huawei.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the new settings is Navigation bar. The Back, Home and Task Switcher on-screen controls can be collapsed with you tap on the small arrow in the left corner of the navigation bar. To bring it back, swipe up from the bottom of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new setting is the Power Manager. It has three customizable modes - Intelligent, Normal and Optimum performance. You can configure each of those modes, setting up what apps run at startup, as well as which are allowed to run in the background and which aren't.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new Gloves mode toggle is available in the Settings menu. If turned on, you will be able to operate the Ascend Mate display with gloves, but this may reduce your battery life.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last two new settings are One hand operations and Suspend button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With One hand operations enabled, you can move the screen unlock, dialer, and the keyboard left or right on the screen, depending on which hand you are using. It's a handy feature to have on such a big device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last new feature in the Settings menu is the Suspend Button. Turning this on will give you a semi-transparent shortcut dial you can place wherever you like on the left or right side of the screen. The shortcuts available are calculator, gallery, messages and notes. The gallery and messages shortcuts will open the full-screen apps, while the calculator and notes launch a tiny widget-like application on top of the app you are currently running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, let's see what Huawei has done with the task switcher. Its interface is the same as the stock Android Jelly Bean task switcher, but offers a few extra options. Each app thumbnail now has a dedicated close key (in addition to the default swipe to close gesture). There is also a "Kill all" key at the bottom that will terminate all running apps.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Google Now gives you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you right now. It can interpret a lot of things from your search history as well. If you've been searching for, let's say, your favorite football team, Google Now will prepare a card showing you the next match the team is playing and will provide you score updates once the game begins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Actions can handle stuff like sending messages (SMS or email), initiating a voice call, asking for directions, taking a note or opening a site. Google Now can also launch apps, check and manage your calendar and look for nearby places of interest and stuff like movie openings in theaters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Now on the Huawei Ascend Mate gets activated with an upward-swipe from the virtual navigation bar. Unfortunately this gesture works everywhere but the homescreen. That's right - you need to have an app opened to launch Google Now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to it and the app will give you one of its info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this in the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend Mate is powered by Huawei's own K3V2 chipset. There are four 1.5GHz Cortex A9 cores, a 16-core GPU and 2GB of RAM. The Cortex A9 processor is already dated piece of tech, but it's still quite capable of keeping Android running smoothly on a 720p screen. The Samsung Galaxy SIII, for instance, uses a similar processor and it still gets the job done.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with BenchmarkPi and Linpack, the Ascend Mate posted pretty good scores, on par with the Galaxy S III. Of course, it wasn't able to match the more recent flagships in our database.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to the multiple-core perfromance, the Huawei Ascend Mate behaved similarly to its quad-core Cortex-A9 powered rivals.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've added some GPU benchmarks for good measure to test out the undisclosed 16-core graphics chip inside the Ascend Mate. The Mate didn't do too well here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GLBenchmark 2.5 Egypt (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Epic Citadel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SunSpider is based on JavaScript performance and the two browsers available on the Ascend Mate (the stock one and Chrome) scored similar results.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Vellamo focuses on JavaScript and HTML 5 and is where the Ascend Mate did quite well to match the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S III and the Oppo Find 5.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Vellamo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate did about as expected in our benchmark tests. We can safely say it's more or less on par with some of the 2012 flagships.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real life experience though raised no questions about the performance. The Ascend Mate behaves nicely and feels quite responsive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A standard phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Many of the native apps on the Huawei Ascend Mate come straight from Jelly Bean. The phonebook is just our first stop - it's laid out across three tabs that can be navigated by swipes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The one in the middle is the default tab, listing all contacts. Contacts are displayed with a name and a picture to the left. They can be sorted by first or last name and displayed with the first or last name first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a permanent alphabet scroll on the right to jump straight to contacts starting with a certain letter. There's a regular search too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tapping on the contact image now brings up a tabbed popup. The tabs are phone and email with a list of the available numbers/addresses. These tabs can be swiped sideways too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single contact view top row has a star to favorite a contact, a pencil to edit it, and a Settings button that lets you share, copy or delete a contact as well as set the phone to redirect calls from that contact straight to voice mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath is a list of all contact info sorted by category: phone numbers, emails, events, notes and so on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While editing a contact, you can add new fields of different types to fill in more contact details. You can link contacts too, if you've added the same person on multiple services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts can be filtered by service (e.g. hide all Facebook contacts) and even by group (so you can hide all contacts not in a group, for example).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the other two tabs in the phonebook are Groups and Favorites. Groups are listed by service (e.g. your Gmail account), while favorites are a listed as a grid of large contact photos, which is really thumbable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The in-call sound was good and loud and we had no issues with reception. The Huawei Ascend Mate features a secondary microphone for active noise cancellation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the call log share the same screen. The dialer offers smart dialing and it works both with names and numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer offers a shortcut to the Contacts app and vice versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We put the Ascend Mate through our traditional loudspeaker test and it managed a Good score. We found its speaker to be loud enough and missed calls or notifications are unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about this test here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging section is business as usual. All SMS/MMS communication is organized into threads - which can be mass-deleted - and each thread is displayed like an IM chat session, the latest message at the bottom. You can manage individual messages (forward, copy, delete) and even lock them (to prevent deletion). You can use search to find a specific message in all conversations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the Ascend Mate to delete older messages (by default, it keeps 200 texts and 20 MMS per conversation). You can activate delivery reports, as well as read reports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.), which will convert the message to an MMS. If you need multiple slides or multiple attachments, you can go to a full-blown MMS editor as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the first thing you'll notice is that Google has done away with the bottom bar that hosted buttons for new mail, search, labels, refresh and menu. Three of those have now been moved to the action bar on top and refresh has been integrated into the UI, in the shape of pull to refresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Gmail app now displays contact images in mails. If an email has multiple recipients, they're shown in a grid similar to the Hangouts app. If there is no contact image, it just shows the first letter of the sender on a color background. You can disable sender images in the email app if you wish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Gmail v4.5 also includes the four new inbox options. You can have your mail sorted by Primary, Social, Promotions and Updates as you can on Gmail web, which makes it easy to keep track of your mail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike its Gmail counterpart, this app supports a combined inbox view. It color codes the inboxes so you can easily tell where each message came from. Unfortunately, there's no moving between messages with sideways swipes here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hangouts, the ex-GTalk client, handles the Instant Messaging department. The new app is a massive update over the old GTalk and offers group video chats, emojis, photo exchange, history sync across multiple devices, and completely new UI design. It's available on iOS as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei keyboard is quite comfortable to type on. You can switch to the default Android keyboard if you prefer, but Huawei's is bigger, making it easier to type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Huawei keyboard has a few very useful options. First, you can change the keys' height - there are four different settings available and you can make the keys really big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, you can opt for one-hand mode, where the keyboard becomes smaller and sticks to the left or right side of the screen. That way you can use it only with your thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you swipe left or right on the keyboard you'll access the old-fashioned keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Huawei's keyboard also offers handwriting support.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Stock image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Huawei Ascend Mate comes with the stock Android 4.1 Jelly image gallery. The Default view of the gallery is Albums, which is what we're used to seeing - it lists all folders in the phone as stacks of photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides Album view, you also get Locations (photos are grouped based on where they were taken), Times (grouped by when they were taken), and People (if the photos have tagged faces in them).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting inside an album displays all the photos in a rectangular grid, which is horizontally scrollable. When you try to scroll past the end, the photo thumbnails will tilt to show you that you've reached the end.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you view a single photo, you'll get Share, Delete and More Settings shortcuts above the photo. You can share a photo via DLNA, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Picasa, MMS, Google+, Hangouts, Facebook, Twitter, Email and Gmail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu lets you do simple edits to a photo (rotate, crop) or go into a more capable editor with a lot more options. The editor offers light adjustments (so you can bring out the shadows or the highlights), effects, color styles, red eye correction, straightening a photo, sharpening and face glow (which detects faces automatically). Most of these options have a slider that lets you fine-tune the intensity of the effect.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An app called Movie Studio handles editing videos and it's quite feature-rich. You can add multiple videos to the timeline and trim their start and end points, you can add titles and effects (including transition effects) add music and there are multiple options available when you decide to export the video (resolution, quality, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's an app that can completely eliminate the need of a computer for most people when creating videos. Plus Apple charges a good amount of money for the same functionality with their iMovie app. Same goes for the image editor too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is part of the gallery, will plays anything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend Mate doesn't have much of a video player - you just open videos from the gallery and that's that. On the up side, it handled most videos we threw at it - all the way up to 1080p, DivX, XviD, MKV and even WMV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had no issues with sound either - AC3 and DTS codecs give most phones a headache - and there's Dolby Mobile 3.0+ available to enhance the audio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get play/pause and a slider to scrub through the video plus a Dolby on/off switch. That's it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated video player (just like the Music player) offers non-customizable equalizer presets only when you plug a pair of headphones in. You can pop up the preset list with a tap on the Dolby Mobile virtual switch at the top of the Now Playing screen. In case you are using the loudspeaker, a tap on the Dolby logo will just turn on or off the Dolby Mobile enhancement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Subtitles are supported, you just need to name the subtitle file the same as the video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 6.1 HD display is great for watching movies on the go. In case you need more functionality, you can also download a third-party movie player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Dolby Mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate comes with an app called Music that is an updated version of the stock music player. It launches with three of the recently played tracks and a list of all available sorting options: All songs, Favorites, Playlists, Artists, Genres, Albums, and Folders. As soon as you choose one those, the interface switches to tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now playing interface features more eye-candy including album art. You can swipe to skip tracks or tap on one of the floating album covers to bring out a list of all songs in that album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the album art is an upwards pointing arrow, which brings out a panel with the song lyrics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music app offers non-customizable equalizer presets only when you plug in a pair of headphones. You can get to the equalizer with a tap on the Dolby Mobile key at the top of the Now Playing screen. In case you are using the loudspeaker, the Dolby logo will only toggle Dolby Mobile on and off.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate has a built-in FM receiver. It can play through the headset or the loudspeaker, but you'll need to have the headset plugged in as it serves as an antenna. We were disappointed not to find RDS - radio stations need to be named by hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Solid audio output<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate was also subjected to our usual audio quality testing routine and its scores came out pretty good. It's output was rather quiet in both parts of the test, but it was clean enough to please the majority of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When connected to an active external amplifier the Huawei Ascend Mate managed excellent scores all over the field with no weak points to its performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When we plugged in a pair of headphones, stereo crosstalk increased quite rapidly and some intermodulation distortion crept in. It's good overall, but extremely demanding audiophiles might not be perfectly happy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Decent 8MP snapper<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate has an 8MP camera for maximum image resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. There's a single LED flash to go with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface looks pretty standard - you get a still/video camera toggle, a virtual shutter and a shortcut to the gallery on the right. The fun stuff is on the left side - you get multiple shooting modes (we'll cover those in a second), color effects, face effects and general settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two other buttons in the viewfinder can toggle the front and rear cameras, set the flash mode and turn on/off the touch focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shooting modes include HDR, burst, smile and beauty shot, panorama and low-light. The group mode is pretty impressive - it managed to track up to 25 faces and snap five consecutive shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the snapshot's been taken, you can tap on any face and pick which of the five shots the phone should use - so if anyone blinked while you were taking the shot, you can correct it in a second. We guess it's the Scalado technology that powers the camera but Huawei say nothing about it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the settings menu you can enable things like geotagging, red-eye reduction, gridlines and adjust the image settings. White Balance, ISO settings and scene selections are also available here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Volume Up key doubles as a hardware camera shutter inside the camera app. You can hold it to focus and it will take a picture upon release.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera offers reasonable levels of fine detail and manages to keep the noise in check. The colors are oversaturated but not too bad and the exposure is good too. One thing to watch out for is the autofocus accuracy - we had several shots (more than usual) which were out of focus. The corners of the samples are quite soft, pointing to somewhat inferior lens quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out these HDR shots too. Keep in mind that you have to have a steady hand for those two to work properly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a panorama sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The synthetic resolution chart shows excellent results that can rival the best in the 8MP range. The noise-reduction is well-behaved, while white balance is quite accurate in artificial lighting. There's very good detail (and some oversaturated colors).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Camcorder does 1080p<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate's main camera records videos at up to 1080p@30fps, while the front facer is good for up to 720p@30fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camcorder interface is practically identical to that of the still camera. You lose the color effects option, but you can still enable the face effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are MP4 encoded at a bitrate of about 25Mbps for 1080p videos. There's stereo sound and the 30fps mark is consistently met.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are is a 1080p video sample we've uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you want to look closer at the video quality, you can download the untouched 1080p@30fps sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate qualifies for the 1080p competition that's going on in our Video Compare Tool. The results are on par with the Galaxy Mega 6.3 - there's a lot of color fringing, which is easily fixed in-camera for the stills , but obviously this sort of correction is not possible for video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, that effect isn't that noticeable in real-life scenes and they end up looking quite okay. Even in low light the videos are good.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity misses LTE and NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend mate comes with quad-band 2G/GPRS/EDGE and penta-band 3G, meaning you'll be able to use it pretty much anywhere in the world. 3G comes with HSDPA and HSUPA - for up to 42Mbps downlink and 5.7Mbps uplink. There is no LTE support though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n with DLNA, so you can easily play media (photos, videos, music) from DLNA-enabled storage devices or push content from your phone to a DLNA TV or music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bluetooth 4.0 is also available but there's no NFC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microUSB port on the Huawei Ascend mate also supports USB host so you can attach USB flash drives or connect mice/keyboards.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Excellent web browser experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Ascend Mate comes with two excellent web browsers - the stock Jelly Bean edition and Google Chrome. The stock browser UI is quite minimalistic - you get the URL bar with a tabs and a settings shortcuts, and that's it. Hitting the Settings key reveals the rest of the controls - everything from searching on the page, saving to bookmarks to useful options like bypassing mobile sites, saving a page for offline reading and sharing a page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full settings menu includes some really interesting options. For example, you can set your search provider to be Yahoo or Bing, you can adjust text size and the level of which double tap will zoom in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tab switching is handled in a similar way to switching between apps. You can even close tabs by swiping them off the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser has Incognito mode (there's no global setting, but you can open Incognito tabs). The other thing the browser does is preload search results when it's confident you'll click on them. These are two tricks borrowed from Google's desktop browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quick controls are available from the Labs settings, which reveal three controls (Tabs, URL, More) when you tap anywhere on the edge of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We still prefer the Chrome browser because of its cross-platform sync capabilities. It's absolutely identical in terms of interface, features (sans the Quick Controls), and behavior. Sometimes it's even faster.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate comes with Kingsoft Office, which handles document editing with ease. It supports Word, Excel and PowerPoint docs (both the 2003 and 2007 versions), it opens PDF files and it doubles as a file explorer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a document, you get plenty of options - from text size and formatting to text justification, lists, tables, an Excel formula editor and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You do get a proper file explorer too - it has two tabs that handle the internal and external storage organized by folders. The app also handles ZIP files. It supports batch operations too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar features four views - Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Agenda. The app can easily handle several online calendars as well as the local calendar. You can add multiple reminders for each event and search all events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock app supports multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. World Clock, Stopwatch and Timer functions are available as additional tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You also get a basic Notes app and a Sound recorder. There's a Weather app too, which offers weather info for multiple locations complete with beautiful animations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good old calculator is here too - it has big, easily thumbable keys and you can swipe to the left to bring up the advanced functions (trigonometry, square root, brackets, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there's the flashlight app.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps and Navigation<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Huawei Ascend Mate comes with a GPS receiver, which took about 80 seconds to get satellite lock upon a cold start. You can use the A-GPS functionality to get near instantaneous locks. Alternatively, network positioning will also do if you only need a rough estimate of your location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Ascend Mate comes with Google Maps and Navigation (region dependent). Voice-guided navigation has become a viable solution since the v5.0 update. Vector maps are smaller and easier on the data traffic and reroute is an option if you go off course without the need to connect to the Internet. In fact, the only time you need a data connection is when you initially plan the course - Navigation will cache the needed maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the app also supports the Street View mode. If it's available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google's app uses vector maps, which are very data efficient. The latest version has an easy to use interface for caching maps - you just choose "Make available offline" from the menu and pan/zoom around until the desired area is in view (there's an indicator showing how much storage caching that area will take). You can later view cached areas and delete ones you no longer need.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that there's a limit to the size of the area you can cache - you can't just make all of Europe available offline, not even a whole country. We managed to cache Berlin and parts of the surroundings before Maps told us the area is too big. There's no address search either in the cached maps and you can only cache map data in supported regions of the world.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Google Maps Navigation doesn't do it for you, you can grab another from the Android Market - there are both free and paid alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Play Store<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Running Android Jelly Bean, the Huawei Ascend Mate has access to the latest apps and the microSD-expandable memory guarantees you won't have trouble with storage space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Store is organized in a few scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. The in-app section is untouched though and it's very informative - a description, latest changes, number of downloads and comments with rating. There is usually a demo video and several screenshots for most apps too.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A niche pioneered by Samsung is suddenly such a busy place that the Koreans are forced to revisit it with a new strategy. Smartphone manufacturers, big and small, are keen to emulate the success of the Note lineup, without actually meaning to stand in its way. But the influx of genuinely affordable alternatives is causing Samsung to act.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Many people, us included, saw the announcement of the Galaxy Mega pair of phablets as an attempt to take the Note experience over to the midrange. With devices like the Huawei Ascend Mate, we're inclined to think Samsung is taking measures against losing market to genuinely affordable phablets by less prominent but highly motivated competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of screen size, the Huawei Ascend Mate slots in between the Galaxy Mega 5.8 and the Mega 6.3. However in terms of specs, it's a lot closer to the upper end, that is the Mega 6.3, and yet notably cheaper than it. That's a solid start for the Chinese phablet, which is just an NFC radio and LTE support short of matching its Samsung rival.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC First ? Samsung Galaxy Mega 5.8 I9150</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there are other things Huawei could've done better. For one, the homescreen of the Ascend Mate doesn't auto-rotate, which is an important omission for a device of near-tablet size that's trying to offer the best of both worlds. The Galaxy Mega 6.3 has it and we found it to make the right difference.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The peculiar Emotion UI, skinning Jelly Bean, will not be everyone's cup of tea, but we don't think the lack of an app drawer is a deal-breaker. The Ascend Mate is adequately powered too, by a proprietary Huawei chip. The four Cortex A9 cores are doing a reasonable job, and compare favorably against the 1.7GHz dual Kraits of the Mega 6.3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 720p display and 73% screen-to-body ratio are solid credentials too, considering there are no AMOLEDs at this size and in this price bracket. The imaging capabilities of the Huawei Ascend Mate are decent, too. The big ace up its sleeve however is battery life. Competitors will be hard-pressed to match the performance of its 4050 mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of which, the Samsung Galaxy Note II is yet another item on the list of potential alternatives. It may as well have been the inspiration for Huawei to go ahead with the Ascend Mate. Nearly a year after launch, the Note costs just a little more than the Ascend Mate. And while the Super AMOLED display and the S-Pen might be well worth the 30 euro premium, you'd be losing more than half an inch of screen estate - something that should be pretty valuable to you if you are reading this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two more 5.7-inch phablets about to be released soon - the Acer Liquid S1 and the ZTE Grand Memo. The Liquid S1 runs on a quad-core Cortex-A7 processor and has a 720p display, while the Grand Memo is powered by Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 800 chipset with quad-core Krait 400 CPU. Price tags are expected to hover around the Ascend Mate's mark, which would make for an interesting clash. We are not sure how easy those alternatives will be to find outside China, whereas the Ascend Mate is readily available in a number of markets, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Acer Liquid S1 ? ZTE Grand Memo V9815</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Asus' latest phablet offering is the 6" Fonepad Note. It packs a sharp 1080p 6" screen of 367ppi and a dual-core Atom CPU, which should be able to even outperform the Mate CPU, despite coming two cores short of it. There's a replica of the S Pen too, and front-mounted stereo speakers. The Fonepad Note is expected to hit the shelves about the same time Samsung announces the Galaxy Note III in Q3 this year, and, if priced right, will put some real pressure on Huawei's phablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Asus Fonepad Note FHD6</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's not forget the Huawei Ascend Mate was announced in Q1 and it's only logical for more recent gadgets to outdo it in terms of specs. It still looks like Huawei are doing most things right - the Mate is a well-balanced package and the price is hard to beat. Battery life - harder still. Sensible styling meets adequate equipment, and there's a key selling feature to nudge fence-sitters. There's little more to ask for in the phablet midrange.</paragraph>
