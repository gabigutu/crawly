			<paragraph>Size doesn't bother you? Then get ready for the stars and the moon, for the communicator gives it all: internet, GPS, excellent camera and many others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia E90 Communicator is the latest addition to the set of contemporary high-performance devices for executives. We had to wait three years since the last Nokia 9500 Communicator appeared. Our patience was duly rewarded at the 2007 3GSM Congress, when Nokia unveiled the ultimate no-compromise mobile communication device. It remains faithful to some of the family traditions, others it forsakes, but the outcome is downright worth it. Nokia E90 has the familiar body construction: a hefty handset, which opens up to reveal a wide landscape display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before the E90 appeared, communicators used to be a class on its own in the Nokia portfolio. They had their own UI, which brought forth a number of issues. Above all, every application had to be adapted to the uncommon S80 UI. Quite unaffordable and therefore rare, communicators were ostracized by software developers. That's exactly the flaw, which has been addressed in the new Nokia E90. The phone features a standard Symbian 9.2 and 3rd edition S60, working on a giant display and ensuring far greater compatibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In closed position E90 looks like a traditional, though well oversized, Nokia bar. For the lack of a better reference point for size and weight, we compare it against the older Nokia 9500. The newer release has notably reduced size and still packs in near full contemporary functionality. The table below compares the essential features of the last two Communicator generations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Size is the first thing you'll have to put up with about the Nokia E90. And it may as well be the last. What you get is unmatched keypad space and display size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  E90 is a direct descendant of the Nokia 9500. Different age, different design </paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Opening the treasure chest<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Not that it's that important, but the most expensive Nokia comes in a plain box, like most of the brand's common models. Nothing ostentatious, nothing of the 8600 Luna stuff. Who would want that in a device that means business anyway? Purpose is what matters. You get a stereo headset, a 512 MB microSD card, miniUSB cable, a battery and a charger. The package also contains a Quick Start guide and a User Manual. The latter is 120 pages and still fails to cover all the features. The enclosed DVD ROM has the essential PC Suite application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia has learnt a lesson from constructing communicators, the touchy hinge now has metal reinforcement. The E90 proudly puts its shiny ends on show. Two distinct stops are noticeable when opening the device: one at near 100 degrees, the other in full flat position. None of them is perfect though, the good thing is that the device is stable in almost any selected angle in-between.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the casing looks uniform, the materials used are not the same. The front is almost all made of metal, except for the plastic keypad. The rear side is plastic, the battery cover the only metal element. Surfaces are of exceptional quality, the finishing of all elements is excellent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, in closed position the handset looks a classic Nokia bar, a generously sized one, that is. The traditional layout has taken advantage of the available space and all controls are ample enough and very user-friendly. The D-pad is brilliant, comfortably raised and with a very well-sized confirm key. The keypad is a truly up to the highest standards of the brand. The external display supports QVGA resolution. Though smaller than the inside one, it's by no means secondary, as it takes the better part of the phone-related workload of the communicator. An interesting detail halfway down the right side of the display is the ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multimedia elements are at the back. The lens of the 3.2 megapixel camera is unprotected and risks suffering damage. At least, it's sunk half a millimeter inside its nest, thus out of contact with the surface when using the communicator in open position. Next to the lens is the LED flash. Two tiny grills mark the loudspeakers. The sound they produce is loud and fine.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Did anyone say notebook?<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Comparing the Nokia E90 to a laptop computer could be a little too far, but certain similarities can't be overlooked. Opening the communicator gives the user a QWERTY keypad of unrivaled size and a huge landscape display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five rows of slightly elevated alphanumeric keys, with control buttons on both sides. Made of hard plastic, the keys are very responsive. Marked by a delicate click, every press is precise and perceptible. Although we're talking of unmatched keypad size, in mobile phone terms of course, all-finger typing is still out of the question. The perfect setup seems holding the communicator with both hands and using both thumbs to type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You maybe interested how the two parts of the Communicator behave in the hinge area. When you're closing the Communicator, the display hinge starts to fold first. Only when you've reached its closing point, the keyboard hinge will start to fold too. If you deliberately change that order, the two parts will touch indeed, but this time it doesn't seem to be a problem. Just the opposite, the two halves are easy to fix at a comfortable angle for working with the device. With the keypad part considerably heavier than the lid, the E90 is very stable in laptop-like use. You're only likely to break the balance when using the control buttons on both sides of the internal display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the QWERTY keyboard, on the right, above the Enter and Backspace buttons, is the 5-way navigation key. It's almost identical to the one on the front cover of the handset. Reasonably enough, this time it's a tad smaller and flatter, and therefore a little less comfortable to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A row of seven application keys and the Symbian key are framed in chromium above the alphanumeric keypad. With them, Symbian multitasking gets a whole new dimension. On the sides of the display there are two pairs of buttons: the Call and End keys on the left, and the Selection keys on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another point of interest is whether the keypad is touching the display in closed position. We regret to inform you that it does. We did a few tests moistening several keys and closing the lid with as little pressure as possible. Folding the Communicator open revealed moisture stains on the display, and that's bad news given our experience with notebooks. With laptops the contact area is incomparably bigger, but the display of the Communicator is also facing problems in the long run. Folding it hundreds of times with the keypad obviously touching the screen, you're in for a trouble. Pity, raising the rubber cushions in the corners of the lid by an extra millimeter could've been enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another downside we came across is that the keyboard layout seems market-dependent. We failed to find a setting allowing to switch form QWERTY to an alternative QWERTZ layout. Changing the input language didn't do either. It looks like it will take a third party application to address this issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The internal display is the pivotal aspect of the Communicator. It will only take a few seconds to see the point in carrying an oversized brick in your pocket. With the E90, mobile web browsing is a truly novel experience. Some people on the team claimed they came across noticeable shades when changing images but I have to disagree. On the other hand, I can't afford to overlook the excellent color rendering, outstanding contrast and fineness without visible rasterization.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Feed it before bedtime<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's take a brief look at the charger. Across-the-board testing managed to get our E90 pretty starved. In extreme cases, when using it as an HSDPA modem with a laptop for example, we were forced to charge the Communicator twice within the same day. A less busy schedule could have seen the E90 going for a good 3 days, but a Communicator is likely to get heavy workloads, so don't expect the battery to last for more than two days. That makes the charger an essential accessory and we're therefore disappointed the E90 doesn't feature the mini version available with the Nokia N95.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rear metal cover is firmly fixed, but once you've released it the battery will just fall off. We came to wonder why it wasn't a little more secure. Anyway, you'll only have to deal with that when inserting SIM, so this isn't much of a worry. The memory card slot has its own little cover at the bottom side of the device, which we found quite practical.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music: Let down by the details<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Let's begin with the last element of the accessory package: the stereo headphones. The difference from the older model is clearly noticeable as soon as you open the box. The remote control pad is smaller, undeniably better looking and of higher quality. It still has the Made in China tag but somehow that's not as stigmatizing as it used to be with some older Nokia models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It won't be long though, before you get the first disappointment. The remote control pad has no volume controls. The E90 has the wide multi-pin Pop-port replaced by a miniUSB and a 2.5mm jack. The miniUSB is of course more than welcome, but the 2.5mm jack is beyond comprehension. Nokia E90 is clearly a business device and that's one possible reason for not making it like the N95. Could the Communicator have then been much more attractive? If cost was the issue, it may have been worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sound quality of the original headphones will please all but the most undemanding users. Using alternative headsets will require a jack adapter, plus you'll lose the handsfree functionality. All that may seem as hairsplitting, but it does compromise the music player capabilities of the E90 Communicator.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of software, things are almost the same as in other Symbian handsets of the Finnish brand. The appearance of the music player application is the only novelty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia E90 features a built-in FM radio. It doesn't support RDS but is stereo, and can even play on the loudspeakers but the handsfree should still be plugged as usual to ensure reception. The Auto settings are worth praising, they scanned the whole FM band in about 10 seconds.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Leave the compact camera home<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As it does with music, the E90 is lagging behind Nokia N95 in terms of camera capabilities. A camera lens cover is missing, and resolution has dropped from 5 to 3.2 megapixels. LED flash is present (probably the exact same one) and autofocus is available too. Luckily, the E90 proved consistent in terms of photo quality too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is very similar to that of the cameraphone frontrunner N95. Different functions are displayed in the Camera Toolbar at the right side of the display:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The digital zoom is activated by scrolling left or right on the Navi scroll key. Zooming crops out the image, and as a result you get less sharpness and lower picture quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although the E90 is 2 megapixels behind N95, video recording capabilities are on par. Video can be captured in several resolution levels. The lowest available, and thus ideal for MMS, is in 3GP format. The top one is VGA at 30 fps. recorded in MP4 format, and - just to let you know - a minute long recording will cost you near 20 MB of memory. Recording length is unlimited and only depends on the free memory you have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The range of settings for video recording is considerably narrower than that in still camera mode. The available settings are Night Mode, White Balance and Color Effects. Digital zoom can be applied when shooting video too, but zooming isn't smooth and considerably lowers image quality. The user can also opt to turn audio recording off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Browsing pictures and video recordings is much more convenient than in Symbian handsets of smaller displays; the preview mode is an extra option. The zoom functionality gets to be appreciated on the large internal display.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>King of the Symbian realm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To put it straight, the E90 Communicator has a lot in common with the other Nokia smartphones, mostly with the N95. What E90 loses in terms of multimedia capabilities, it's quick to gain as regards user interface and system speed and stability. The huge display makes the difference. QVGA is one thing, 800x352 pixels is another, and the Symbian OS on S60 3rd Edition makes the best use of it. The laborious searching for items in other handsets is just a walk in the park for E90 thanks to the extensive previewing functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Top of the business E-series, E90 is gifted with more than generous RAM. Combined with the already mentioned row of application keys, it gives a totally new perspective to Symbian multitasking. Let's compare the E90 with Nokia E65, another handset of the business E-series. With E65, launching the web browser turns off the music player in the background. The Communicator, on the other hand, is a lot more like a computer. Switching between tasks is smooth and losing the work in a background application is very unlikely. Yet, even the E90 has its limits. Should you cross the reasonable boundaries, the classic flaw of all Symbian handsets will befall you: an unexpected and uncontrollable halt of all running applications. The E90 is miles ahead of all other Symbian smartphones, but still a little step short of perfection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking the huge display aside, we're still talking of the good old S60 3rd edition user interface. There is therefore little point in looking closely at all menus and sublevels. Let's instead try and highlight the areas where the E90 is different (read: better). Upon opening the Communicator, the internal display takes over and the transition is seamless. Not always so though the other way around. Some applications (like Maps, and other GPS related) didn't have a problem, but in some cases folding the handset closed resulted in getting a stand by view of the display. That's not that bad after all, as the applications didn't shut down and could be easily recalled through the multitasking key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That the system is not specially tailored for a wide display is only obvious in some of the menus, where the descriptions are shortened. This does seem out of reason as there is more than enough space around the violently shortened rows. Otherwise, the Symbian adaptability to wide spaces is admirable, we didn't run into problems even with third party applications.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Office in the pocket<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The ultimate business device, E90 excels at office work. Let's look at its messaging capabilities, along with its performance in viewing, browsing, composing and editing documents.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality and performance of all the applications above are described in detail in the following chapters of our extensive Nokia N95 review:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia is traditionally sparing of words when it comes to built-in components of their handsets. The type of GPS chip integrated in E90 is thus quite obscure. Our head-to-head testing of E90 and N95 indicate the chips in both handsets are quite possibly the same. At least in terms of performance, sensitivity and speed. The built in GPS related applications are also identical, which - again - takes you to the respective chapter of the N95 review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The E90 package includes the latest version of the Nokia PC Suite. You get full synchronization and modem connectivity, phone memory back up, phonebook editing, composing and sending messages directly from the computer and upgrading the phone firmware. Quick transfer of images and music is also available. Mass storage mode is enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having mentioned the modem functionality, let us look closer at the HSDPA abilities of the Communicator. Our tests have shown that download speed when using the E90 as a modem is considerably lower than what a notebook with an integrated HSDPA card can achieve. This result of course depends on many variables: network status, time of day, number of users logged on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A pocketful of skills<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may be under the impression that the Communicator is an N95 in disguise. That maybe true, but at least, the disguise is a good and thorough work. Nokia have undoubtedly succeeded in creating the ultimate business device. For those, who can live with the few compromises we outlined, the E90 is an all-round tool, with multimedia and navigation just part of its armory. When makers of navigation software achieve better compatibility with integrated GPS, the Communicator may be a full fledged in-car navigation device. Its navigation skills have already been proven in a weekend of geocaching. As regards its Internet capabilities, the Communicator is beyond comparing with regular handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So? Is Nokia E90 the new ruler? The mobile realm has long gone beyond mobile phones and portable computers. We now have UMPC and its derivatives and, what's more, we cannot afford to overlook competitive communicators powered by Windows Mobile. The answer is up to you. Anyway, we think the throne befits the E90.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still, it goes without saying that Nokia E90 will not be a mass device. Size is hard to swallow, not to mention price.</paragraph>
