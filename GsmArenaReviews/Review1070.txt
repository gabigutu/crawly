			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia may be at a point when if Lumia sneezes the entire company catches a cold, but a small part of their system is remarkably resistant. Well, yes, it's the dumbphones and some may say they're too primitive a species to be affected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Asha line is doing well nonetheless - and not only on traditionally loyal developing markets. The neat swipe-driven Asha Touch interface and the Nokia Store bring those otherwise basic packages a lot closer to the smartphone experience that everyone is so keen on getting lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, while Lumia is rightfully at the height of hype, the Ashas have been quiet but busy. The lineup is being refined and updated and one of the latest installments, the Nokia Asha 308, is offering the familiar (and impressively efficient) Finnish dual-SIM setup on a capacitive screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When the new Asha Touch lineup was launched in the summer, the capacitive screen was a luxury that only the top-spec'd Asha 311 could afford. The Asha 305 and 306 were the basic packages offering a choice between Wi-Fi and dual-SIM. They both failed to impress in terms of interface response and fluidity, though with the resistive screens and limited RAM sharing the blame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 308 is the dual-SIM half of a pair of new recruits, and while it offers a similar level of equipment to the 305, the capacitive screen and double the amount of RAM are expected to make the right difference. We're about to see if they do. Follow us on the next page where we start with the usual hardware tour.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Asha 308<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 308 has everything you may need inside the retail box to get started: the traditional Nokia A/C charger (although the phone charges off USB too), a short microUSB cable and a single-piece headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Inside the phone you'll also find a 2GB microSD card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Asha 308 306-degree view<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>At 109.9 x 54 x 13 mm, The Nokia Asha 308 is almost exactly the size as the Asha 305, and weighs just 6g more, tipping the scales at 104g. The handset is small though by no means slim, and the back is gently curved for a comfortable fit in hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality and controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 308 has the typical styling of the series, but it's better than the Asha 305 in a number of important ways. The capacitive screen is one of them, though it's not something you'd notice right away. What we mean is the image quality isn't superior in any way - the response to user commands is.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing we instantly appreciated is the sensible finish - nothing fancy but we're happy we're not treated to the cheap gloss of the Asha 305 again. And there's something quite subtle like the shape of the call keys beneath the screen. The two controls are nicely sculpted for great touch orientation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is the typical flaw of course of cheap phone design - plenty of unused space around the 3" display. Even for a handset with actual hardware buttons, there's too much screen bezel, especially at the top. The space above the screen is usually reserved for a camera and sensors, of which the Nokia Asha 308 has none.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display of the Asha 308 hasn't grown in either size or resolution but it's a capacitive unit with vastly superior response. The lightest taps are registered and scrolling is impressively smooth. Things like that would be instantly appreciated by users who may have been let down by the sluggish jerkiness of resistive touch. Double the amount of RAM is certainly of help here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image quality on the other hand remains virtually unchanged. Contrast is average, but sharpness is rather low. Viewing angles are pretty poor as well, but then again that's about as good as it gets in this price range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the Asha 308 score from our display sunlight legibility test. It actually did quite well, beating some way more expensive composition. That polarization filter that Nokia installed is obviously doing a marvelous job.

 </paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The only thing to note above the screen is the earpiece - there's no proximity or ambient light sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Underneath the screen you'll find the mouthpiece on the thin strip of plastic that accommodates the call. The end key will exit any currently running app and take you back to the homescreen. On a long-press it serves as a power button too. The nice shape of the keys helps touch orientation but they have a rather low stroke with inadequate press feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Asha 308 accommodates the volume rocker and the lock button. The slit for removing the back panel is just below the lock key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side has the microSD card slot and the secondary SIM compartment. Both are sealed with plastic lids and are hot-swappable. The lanyard eyelet is near the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top is where the connectivity ports are. The microUSB port in the middle can be used for charging. On the sides you get the 3.5 mm audio jack and the standard charging port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is completely bare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel of the Asha 308 is entirely made of plastic, a subtle pattern visible through a coat of glaze. The 2MP camera lens is centrally placed at the top and the loudspeaker grille is in the bottom right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 1110 mAh Li-Ion battery powers the phone and inside the battery compartment is the primary SIM slot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 308 is probably the best-looking member of the Asha Touch family. There's nothing fancy of course in terms of finish but the phone is well-built and doesn't get carried away with the gloss. Overall, it's a simple package with a grown-up, sensible design. The user experience is much better than on a resistive screen, and the phone feels much snappier. Users will certainly appreciate the hot-swappable extra SIM and memory card slot .</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S40 thinks it's MeeGo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have decent experience with the new Asha Touch variation of the Series 40 software and we like what Nokia has done with its best-selling platform. The software takes a lot of design cues from its Symbian (or "Nokia OS" if you will) and MeeGo brothers, and as such the user interface structure is based on the MeeGo one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All interactions are touch-based, except for the red receiver key which is a handy way to bring out the homescreen or close an app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen offers a big clock with the date underneath. A familiar sideways swipe unlocks the phone. Before you do that, you must first wake up the screen, of course. To do that you need to press the hardware lock key; double tap like on the Nokia N9 doesn't work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is an arrangement of three side-scrollable homescreens in MeeGo fashion. The default one is the app launcher - the new Asha Touch gets straight to business.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A swipe to the left will take you to the dialer. In fact, this screen can be customized to show either the music player or the radio, but having the dialer always a swipe away is probably the most useful of the three.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The third homescreen is what was previously known as Active Standby. It's now a pane to fill with shortcuts to frequently used apps or contacts. A tap and hold on that screen triggers Edit mode, so you can choose shortcuts and contacts to add.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, the time and date are displayed too, which in turn serve as shortcuts to the alarm app and the calendar. There are no other widgets available here unfortunately, e.g. a music player widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status bar is visible on top of any of the three screens and you can either tap to expand it or pull it down. It displays notifications of missed events and quick toggles for mobile data, Bluetooth and sound profiles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below you get shortcuts to the music player, the phone and messaging apps. While S40 Asha Touch doesn't really do multitasking, those three apps are almost always available to you, even inside Java apps (the only exception is full screen apps). You can change the track, send a message, make a call and go back to where you left your app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notifications are displayed on the lockscreen too. A convenient shortcut is swiping a notification, which will take you to the relevant app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tiny number icon on the Messaging icon in the app launcher shows the text messages you have received but not yet read. There are similar new email notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case of a missed call that requires your attention, the notification area drops down a bit to briefly display the number and then pulls back up. It leaves a small handle as a reminder, which you can pull to see who's been calling you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are minor but nice touches to a completely revamped interface, which is surprisingly feature-rich, yet beautifully simple. Soft keys are nowhere in sight - every app or screen you open has just a tiny back key instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't miss multitasking, which will never be a part of S40. The Asha 308 comes with all the essential functions as native apps, so they can receive notifications in the background, and the call/text/music functionality is always accessible. It's the most common use case - especially considering there aren't that many third-party apps to switch between (e.g. you're not going to use a third-party music player).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 308 uses the same CPU as the 305, but has twice the RAM which helps it run the UI much more smoothly. There's some lag now and then, but it's nowhere near as bothering as it was on the cheapest of the full-touch Ashas.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>S40 phonebook has a new look<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 308 offers a nice looking and efficient phonebook, which has been a part of the updated touch-friendly Series 40 platform. Under the new Asha Touch interface it integrates with the Call log and the Dialer and that's more than welcome.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts are displayed with a photo and number and on top of the actual list you get the Advanced menu and Add new contact shortcut. Then comes the search field.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual contact details are displayed on a completely redesigned screen. You get a faded contact's picture as a background, with a huge name across and a number below. A few big thumbable icons at the bottom of the screen let you call, text or email the person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add various details to your contacts, like numbers, mail address, ringtone or a URL. You can also choose where to save your contacts - SIM 1, SIM 2 or the phone memory. Only two sorting options are available - by first or last name. Contacts can be copied, moved or deleted either individually or in bulk.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Dual-SIM telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>To make a call, you need to select which SIM the phone should use. You can set a default SIM, which will always be used for calls. Or you can have the phone prompt you to choose manually every time. Selecting a default SIM for texts, MMS or data works the same way so you can have one SIM for calling and texts and the other one for data and MMS, or whatever combination works for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The SIM manager app has a tabbed interface that lets you configure each of the SIM cards, set the phone to Always Ask or set personal preferences for calling, texting and data connections. These are essentially four tabs in the SIM manager interface or four quick toggles in the SIM settings available in the notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Having chosen your preferred settings, the rest is pretty straightforward. As we already said, the Contacts, the Call Log and the dialer are integrated like in mature smart platforms. What's missing is smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We had no reception problems with the Nokia Asha 308. We tested its loudspeaker and found it to be excellent, though the in-call audio could have been improved.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is as good as ever<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The messaging department has everything covered - text messages are organized in threads, there's a chat client with support for multiple services and of course, a feature rich email client with quick setup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a Conversation in the default view of the messaging app lets you delete the conversation or call/email the contact in question instead. Creating a message is pretty straightforward. You can add multiple contacts from your phonebook or simply punch in numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For text entry, you can choose between a portrait multitap keypad, portrait QWERTY keyboard and a landscape QWERTY keyboard. You get a character and message counter either way. Unfortunately, there's no text selection or copying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The portrait multitap keyboard is accurate and can be fairly fast if you enable text prediction. The portrait QWERTY is quite cramped on the 3" screen but the capacitive tech used in it ensures even the lightest of touches are registered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's possible to type on in, but in general our thumbs didn't have the accuracy needed to do it error-free. Flipping the phone horizontally gives the keyboard a lot more room to work with and accuracy is not an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client supports various services such as Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc. with easy email setup, but you can always manually configure an account too. It works with POP3, SMTP, and IMAP4 protocols and supports SSL. When we set up our Gmail account, the app asked us if we want to sign in Gtalk too, which was a pleasant surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can switch between accounts from the fourth tab at the bottom of the screen. The default email view is Inbox but Folder view is supported too, though there's no combined inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple emails can be moved or deleted using the advanced menu in the top left corner. A tap and hold on an email will allow you to reply, delete, star, forward or mark it as read/unread.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Emails are received in the background and a small * appears on the Mail icon in the app launcher when a new email has arrived.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chat client supports multiple services - Facebook, MSN Messenger, Google Talk, Yahoo and Nokia Chat. The tabbed UI of the OS is pleasantly thumb-friendly and those services can run in the background (a circle in the status bar shows your status when you're online, e.g. green for "available", red for "busy").</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great file manager<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 308 has something that makes the (supposedly dumb) S40 UI look much smarter than the likes of iOS and Windows Phone (even stock Android out of the box). That's right, we are talking about a full-featured file browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app is called Files and lists all your local folders with the memory card on top. Different icons are available for the different file types, the multimedia files appear with small thumbs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few handy options are available in the advanced menu - change view and sorting, add new folder or mark some/all files. If you tap and hold on a file you'll get options such as copy, cut, paste, rename, delete, mark and details.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app has everything you may need in a file browser and puts to shame many smart file explorers thanks to its simple yet powerful interface.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Functional gallery and photo editor<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery is a Symbian copycat. Photos are displayed in a three-column grid, with kinetic scrolling enabled. The gallery has one problem - it can't show more than 1000 images. So if your memory card is full of pictures, the Asha 308 is not the best choice of device to browse them on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can organize your photos into albums and there is an album view as a separate tab in the gallery. The video section is the final tab and lists any supported videos you've uploaded on your memory card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap and hold on a file lets you rename, delete, share or assign the image to a contact or set it as wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Auto-rotation and pinch zooming are enabled in the gallery. The phone handles 2MP photos from its camera well enough, but there's still some lag when zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can edit pictures from the advanced menu. The available options are crop, rotate, flip, effects, warp, add frame, clip art, add text, adjust brightness and contrast, retune colors or do auto enhance. Not bad, is it?</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The renovated music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player has a rather basic interface with lots of hidden features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen displays a large album art picture, alongside the track name, a scrubber and music controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom of the screen has three tabs, the first one being the Now Playing screen. The next one is the Library with the default sorting options - all tracks, artists, albums, genres and videos. The last tab has your custom playlists with a few default ones available - recently added, recently played, most played and now playing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shuffle, repeat and equalizers are available too. You can also play music over Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player supports background playback, but there are no quick controls in the notification area or the lockscreen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Nokia Asha 308 comes with a neat and simple interface. You can change stations with the dedicated controls at the bottom. There is a tab with all available stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The radio has RDS support and automatic rescanning.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basic video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There is no dedicated video player within this version of Series 40. You can find you videos in the dedicated video tab of either the gallery or the music player. Or browse them in the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 308 failed to play almost every video file we threw at it, except a QVGA MP4 clip (higher-res MP4s like nHD didn't work). Surprisingly, the phone managed to play the audio of some 1080p music videos, so we could at least listen to those.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mediocre audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to its line-out (when used with an active external amplifier), the Nokia Asha 308 does decently well, achieving some good (if some way off the best we have seen) scores and garnishing them with high volume levels. The frequency response is somewhat disappointing, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones leads to a huge spike in intermodulation distortion and a moderate one in stereo crosstalk as well as some further deviation of the frequency response. Overall, the Asha 308 will hardly become the audiophile's favorite device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>2MP fixed-focus camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 308 has a 2MP fixed-focus camera that produces photos at maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200. The specs alone are enough to show that this camera is only good for the occasional snapshot to share with your friends and not for any demanding applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera's main UI has four shortcuts in each corner of the viewfinder and surprise - they're orientation aware. The virtual shutter key is always in the bottom center and the back key is always in the bottom right corner, which makes for an awkward-looking reshuffle when the screen changes orientation (it's not the fastest auto-rotate around either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shot-to-shot time is north of 5 seconds, so you have to make each shot count as the camera will take a while before it's ready to snap another photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have settings, camcorder/still camera toggle and a shortcut to the gallery. The virtual shutter is always centered at the bottom, whether in portrait or landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Settings you can set effects, self-timer, grid and scenes. There is a deeper Advanced settings menu with resolution options, camera sounds, orientation, etc. One unusual feature is called "Funny sounds", which plays one of several funny sounds just before snapping a photo, to get your subjects to laugh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fixed-focus is something of a forgotten past-time these days and as you can expect the 2 MP stills of the Asha 308 aren't anything special.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Colors look washed out, there isn't nearly as much detail as we would have liked and we found some highlights to have bluish or greenish tints depending on the light.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>You can record video, if you call QCIF@10 fps video<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 308 can record QCIF videos at 10 fps. Let that sink in for a moment. When it comes to bottom of the barrel cameras we usually say "well, it's good enough for MMS," but that would be too generous for this camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's the QCIF@10fps sample for you to check out. It's 20 seconds long but the file is only 380KB, smaller than a lot of static images you'd find on a web page, you can imagine just how much "video" it's in there.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>2G Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 308 has the basics to get you connected to most things in most places. The phone has dual-band 2G for voice and GPRS/EDGE data connectivity everywhere with a GSM network. There's dual stand-by too for the second SIM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 308 lacks Wi-Fi, which to us is considered a criminal offense these days as some cheaper phones with non-touch displays have that. Bluetooth 3.0 with EDR handles things like wireless handsfree dongles but also local file sharing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Asha 308 uses a microUSB port for both data connections and charging and there's the standard 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 308 also has a memory card slot (and a complimentary 2GB microSD card). Coupled with a card reader it can usually give you the fastest data transfer rates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The web browser is good, but sluggish<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Asha 308 uses Nokia's cool Xpress Browser. Its start screen has a unified URL and search bar and a few handy shortcuts to favorite websites and services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed interface offers one-tap access to Favorites, Downloads and Apps. The Favorites tab has the History, Home and Start page shortcuts, and you can add your own bookmarks here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser does the Opera Mini trick - compressing web pages on a dedicated server before sending them to the phone. Pages load quickly (even on EDGE) and don't use much data. Image quality is adjustable (Best/Good/Average or No images).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get only two zoom levels (again, just like Opera Mini): page overview and zoomed in. A single tap will zoom in on the desired part of the page. To zoom back out to overview you need to hit a dedicated button in the bottom left corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the browser feels sluggish when you're interacting with the page and the kinetic scrolling animation is quite choppy. There's no Flash support, but we never expected it here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The organizer on the Nokia Asha 308 is well stocked as usual and things have been nicely touch optimized.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar starts off in month view. Day view is also available, but there's no week view. You have various kinds of events available for setting up: reminder, meeting call, birthday, anniversary and memo. The agenda, to-do and notes tabs in the calendar are self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm app uses big, touchable numbers, making it easy to set and you can make it go off only on specific days. You can customize the snooze time too, but there's only one alarm available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing features include a voice recorder with no time limit, a basic calculator and a countdown timer. They have been touch optimized as well, though we wish the countdown timer used the same big numbers as the Alarm clock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a weather app and pre-installed Facebook and Twitter clients (combined within the Nokia Social app).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia S40 Store and bonus apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can browse the apps available in the Nokia Store by categories - Applications, Games, Audio and Video content, Personalization; or by collections.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of apps and games there, a lot of them free. They are still behind the big players in the app store game, but for a feature phone having an app store at all is a major bonus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finding stuff seems to be a problem as the search function in the store is pretty spotty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your account profile keeps track of all the apps you have installed under My stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia Asha 308 owners have 40 EA games waiting for them in the Nokia Store - all for free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Maps is severely dumbed-down<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Asha 308 doesn't have a GPS receiver but Nokia Maps can use Cell-ID to get your approximate location. The app doesn't feature voice-guided navigation anyway and you can only plan pedestrian routes with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, even if you hook up a Bluetooth GPS receiver to the Nokia Asha 308 it still won't function as a car SatNav. There's no option for a paid upgrade either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Maps are downloaded through your data connection, which is something else to keep in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to its capacitive screen, the Nokia Asha 308 supports pinch zooming, though maps do take a second to redraw. There are also the standard +/- zoom keys if pinching feels awkward on this screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>So, there goes another basic package from the Finns, which should be no surprise for anyone familiar with the Asha lineup. The Nokia Asha 308 slides between the most basic offerings and the Asha 311 the experience has been significantly improved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At first glance, it's the typical entry-level handset: an nicely executed dual-SIM solution and plenty of compromise elsewhere. Yet, the capacitive screen and double the amount of RAM over the Asha 305 are easily felt and bring the user experience up a notch. Who would've thought that 32MB of extra RAM would make such a big difference? The jerky scrolling and laggy overall response of the Asha 305 have been sorted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Asha 305</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it means is the Asha Touch interface can be fully appreciated - from the swipeable three-homescreen setup and the notifications to the smooth inertia scrolling complete with bounce effect. The new Nokia Xpress browser speeds up page loading, there's a reasonable email client on board, social network integration and a proper app store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest omission is a faster Internet connection through either Wi-Fi or 3G but that's how Nokia have been doing things for a while now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the Asha 305 before it, the Asha 308 has a single-SIM twin, Asha 309, which is equipped with a WLAN radio. These are the only things that sets the two phones apart - and we should note that the single-SIM Asha 309 costs a little less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Asha 309</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The key feature of the Asha 308 is dual-SIM telephony and we've found the Nokia solution to be better in some ways than even smartphones. And we don't just mean the hardware (hot-swappable SIM slot), the SIM manager app is superbly efficient and there are even quick toggles in the pull-down notification area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of potential smart competitors, the Samsung Galaxy Y Duos is the most likely pick, being one of the cheapest droids you can get. It comes with a QVGA capacitive touchscreen, a 3MP camera and Android 2.3 Gingerbread. It has better connectivity options including 3G with HSDPA, Wi-Fi with hotspot capabilities and GPS. If dual-SIM telephony is your top priority though, the better battery backup and SIM handling are points in favor of the Nokia Asha 308.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung Galaxy Y Duos S6102</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the looks of it, entry-level smartphones with dual-SIM support are the biggest threat to the Nokia Asha 308, but the good news is there's very few of them (from reputable makers anyway) that come close to the Finn's price. Some people may be less than impressed with how hard the Asha 308 is trying to emulate smartphones. Others will appreciate the fact that this little dumbphone isn't afraid of doing things their way. Nokia is clearly targeting the latter and we don't see why the Asha 308 wouldn't get a warm reception.</paragraph>
