			<paragraph>With 2008 around the corner, hopes are high for the coming year but the devoted fans of Sony Ericsson W880 have yet another reason to eagerly look forward. The expected release of Sony Ericsson W890 should be enough to keep them wide awake and ready for what seems a highly promising successor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With its super slim styling and clean-cut lines, massive 2GB storage add-on and 3.2 megapixel camera, the W890 Walkman phone can hit the right notes with music lovers and design connoisseurs alike. Sony Ericsson W890 speaks the language of the young, fashion-savvy music fans, putting some of the latest Walkman features to good use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Neat and sleek exterior is what you would expect in the successor of W880. The updated Sony Ericsson W890 is the stunning 9.9 mm thick and weighs 78 g, which makes it only a tad thicker and heavier than the W880. The other dimensions are virtually the same, except for the display that has grown from 1.8" to 2" in W890. The handset is offered in three colors: Espresso Black, Mocha Brown, and Sparkling Silver.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson W890 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>It certainly looks the part<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W890 exterior is dominated by straight lines and clean shapes. The minimalist design has crammed the keypad all the way down the front, but still the tiny alphanumeric buttons proved to be more comfortable than they look.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 256K QVGA TFT display now has a 2" diagonal, as opposed to the 1.8" screen of W880. Grown it has, but we still couldn't help the what-if, imagining for a while that 2.2" could've been more like it. On a different note, the new display scores high in both brightness and contrast and it doesn't have reflection issues either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen, a small secondary videocall camera is located, along with the earpiece. The golden Walkman logo completes the set.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the display are the navigation keys, which are grouped in three circular patterns. In the middle is the D-pad. The left semicircle hosts a soft key, the Call key and the Activity menu key, while the right features the other soft key, the End key and the correction C key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both the Call and End key are finished in golden and are tangibly elevated from their surroundings to improve accessibility and minimize wrong presses. The confirming center of the D-pad, doubled as the Walkman play/stop key, has the same golden color.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were delighted to see the dedicated Call and End keys in Sony Ericsson K850 and the high-end Walkman W910. The three-soft-key layout is here as well. The dedicated call and End keys are the major difference from W880 in terms of control and navigation. They are available at the expense of the Back key and the Browser shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the three-soft-key layout the three soft keys perform multiple functions varying by the context of different applications. The die-hard Sony Ericsson user will immediately notice that the location of the soft key functions is reversed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In other Sony Ericsson phones the More soft key is located on the right, whereas now it is called Options and corresponds to the new left soft key, with small exceptions. The proprietary "Back" key is absent, now replaced by the right soft key. The center soft key performs variable functions within applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind though that if you are an experienced Sony Ericsson fan and you encounter the three-soft-key layout for the first time, you will need to take your time and get used to it. The lack of the Back key will surely make your thumb twitching, but bear on, user-friendliness demand its victims.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad is another serious change since W880. The ultra thin keys have been abandoned and typing is definitely improved. The middle-column keys are notched at the sides for better touch orientation. Though still quite small, the keys are quite comfortable and responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the W890 hosts the dedicated Walkman key, which is yet another control finished in gold. The regular Fast port for connecting the charger, headset and the USB cable is at the bottom of this side. It does spoil the clean-cut lines and we would have liked it better if it had a cap on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tiny knob with a padlock pictogram right above the Walkman key could've almost gone unnoticed. This layout is symmetrically doubled on the opposite side, and both knobs are used for releasing/locking the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side features the camera key and the volume rocker. It's also used for zooming when taking pictures and shooting video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the W890 body sports only a small On/Off key. The situation with the bottom part of the device is identical - it doesn't feature any controls or special design elements, save for the Walkman logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel is made of plastic with a metallic paint finish. Topside at the rear are the 3.2 megapixel camera lens, the loudspeaker grill, along with the Sony Ericson and the Walkman logos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the W890 back panel features the lanyard eyelet. An oblong patch of different color with the model name is another highlight on the battery cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right beneath the Fast port there's an M2 logo, marking the memory card slot, which is accessible after releasing the rear cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have seen a variety of mechanisms for removing the battery cover across a few dozens of Sony Ericson phones we've reviewed. W890 is yet another handset to feature a brand new lock/release mechanism.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This time, it is a couple of tiny knobs placed symmetrically on the sides of the phone. To release the lock both knobs need to be slid up. This solution reminds a bit the Sony Ericsson K550.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the battery cover unveils the standard Sony Ericsson BST-33 Li-Poly battery with a capacity of 950 mAh. The same battery is used in Sony Ericsson W880 and W850.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>According to the manufacturer, the battery should last up to 360 hours of standby mode and up to 9.5 hours of talk time when used in a GSM-only network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The more exciting promise though is that the battery would allow W890 to play music continuously for 20 hours straight, two hours more than the official quote for W880.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The memory card slot is located under the battery cover and the SIM bed is right under the battery compartment. The SIM card is relatively easy to insert and remove. Actually, the SIM slot layout is identical to W880.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are very pleased with the construction and friendly feel of the Sony Ericsson W890, though it was expected given the nice first impression W880 made.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>In the Dark<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have no particular concerns with the display and keyboard backlighting - both are at the usual high level we've come to see with the latest Sony Ericsson phones. The keyboard itself has strong backlighting but, surprisingly for a Walkman phone, misses the traditional orange D-pad backlighting in Walkman mode. However, we are uncertain whether this will be the case with the final version of W890, as we're dealing with a beta unit issue.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Loud is not always great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All the latest Sony Ericsson phones we've tested offer very good voice quality for both parties and W890 is no exception. The HSDPA enabled quad-band handset offers good signal reception but, surprisingly, ringing is neither loud nor balanced enough. The loudspeaker seems to do poorly at trebles and basses, too. The results of the loudspeaker test differ a bit from our subjective impression. The test ranked the W890 within the "Very Good" margin.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the W890 ranks along some of the other handsets we've measured in our new speakerphone loudness test. More info on our test here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note: Most of the display screenshots are taken from the W910 review, as its user interface is virtually identical to the one of W890.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A superior user interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface in W890 has the well known Sony Ericsson feature phone styling, spiced up with a few recently introduced features, we've discussed in detail in previous reviews.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new features in the W890 include the optimized Media Center and Flash Lite 2.0 support, the Walkman 3.0 player with SensMe feature. Unfortunately, the auto rotate capability seen in K850 and W910 is missing here. With all the listed innovative features, we feel that the Sony Ericsson phones have now surpassed the competing Nokia S40 models with the only exception being the proprietary Nokia Active standby screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As most previous models, the W890 comes with a dedicated Flight mode. When turning on the phone, you may opt to start it directly into Flight mode. The Sony Ericsson W890 cannot work in Flight mode unless a SIM card is inserted, while competing Nokia S40 UI models are capable of that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In active stand-by mode the screen displays information about the network signal, battery strength, current date and time, plus the next alarm due. Pressing the navigation key in any of the four directions can start a user-programmed feature or application. The main menu itself is a 4 x 3 grid of animated icons, each of which can be directly accessed by pressing its corresponding alphanumeric key. All sub-menus are in list view with tiny icons on the left side. Response is fast in every submenu and application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like Sony Ericsson K850, T650 and W910, the new slim Walkman also supports Flash Lite themes. With our beta version of W890 only the default Walkman theme is preinstalled, but the retail version will have some more. We have paid due attention to the themes and their features in recent Sony Ericsson reviews. If you would like to see how themes enhance the menu and the handling of the phone, please feel free to read the detailed theme chapters in Sony Ericsson W910, K850 and T650 reviews.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to selected functions. The Running Apps tab takes care of multi-tasking. A feature we first saw in K850 allows minimizing the dialog window when you receive files via Bluetooth and opening the window on demand through the Running Apps tab. Strangely, this is not the case when you are sending content via Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Activity menu also offers quick access to recent events, the web menu and the My Shortcuts tab, which is a user-configurable list of favorite features.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The phonebook is even more pumped up<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook can store up to 1000 entries with a total of 7000 phone numbers available (as opposed to K850 with its capacity of 5000 numbers).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phonebook interface makes good use of the three-soft-key layout, as seen in K850. In contacts you can directly open any contact with the middle soft key. The old-school More key is renamed Options and is now on the left side, while in former models, it was inevitably stuck in the right. The third soft key corresponds to "back". Another practical use of the middle soft key is the Send Message option, available when a contact is open and a number is highlighted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A good feature is the Smart Search, which lists all available contacts in the phonebook starting with the digits typed in the standby screen. The search engine looks up both letter combinations in names and phone numbers that start with the digits entered. Here in W890 the Smart Search can also be switched off if not needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also present is the Send All Contacts option that transfers the entire phonebook to another compatible Sony Ericsson device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can choose whether the SIM contacts or the phone contacts should be default for the phonebook. Displaying both lists simultaneously is impossible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a different note, a nice option allows you to auto save to SIM any new contacts that you're saving in the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be ordered by First or Last name. They are searched by gradual typing of the desired name. When adding a new contact, there are 7 phone number fields available. This is the first tab of fields for the new contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second one is for email and web addresses. The third is for assigning a picture, a custom ringtone and a voice command. The fourth goes for Title, Company, Street, City, State, ZIP, Country information. The last, fifth tab, is for additional information and birth date.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you add the birth date, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar and setting a reminder, which we found to be a handy feature.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Call management<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Calls log is divided into four different tabs. They are: All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. The maximum number of records is 30 altogether, shared across the separate tabs. When there are several calls made to a single contact, only the last call gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It is high time Sony Ericsson updated the call log to allow at least 60 records. People with a couple of dozens of calls a day will find 30 records quite insufficient, especially if they receive multiple calls from contacts not in the address book, which they would like to save.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is as smart as possible<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson W890 offers the Manage Messages and Manage Email features, plenty of settings for accounts, and the option to assign categories to messages. These features are embedded in the standard Sony Ericsson interface and have become standard for each new release. The Manage Messages application consists of three tabs. The first one is All Items, There's also an On Mem. Card and an In Phone tab, each including Drafts, Inbox, Outbox, Saved messages, and Sent messages folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This menu allows messages to be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact as well as other functions for improved message handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All messages, except emails, use one Inbox. No matter what kind of message has been received, it goes to the shared Inbox. Only emails have their own dedicated Inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When composing a message, the character counter will alert you when you're 20 symbols short of the 160-character limit. The T9 dictionary goes without saying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Users may opt to sort messages by category list, if a specific category has been defined for a message. Six of them come predefined: Business, Favorites, Follow Up, Fun, Holiday, Important, but categories are fully customizable as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also delete all messages in a given category. Furthermore, messages in categories can have their own sorting with Contact, Date, and size the available filters to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like in K850, in the general inbox there is no indication if a message has been assigned a category. The same holds true for messages that are opened. Generally Manage Messages, together with Categories, offers wide-ranging customization options and unsurpassed message handling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the GSMArena RSS feed, launched not-so-long-ago, we tested the W890 reader located in the messaging menu. When new content is available, a pop-up indication appears on the home screen, prompting to read the issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client in W890 supports dozens of settings and all types of encodings, inherent to more advanced messaging devices. Sony Ericsson W890 can save attachments, no matter if they are supported or unknown file formats. Email messages can be sorted by size, date and time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Office documents as Word, Excel and PDF cannot be opened, of course. It's about time that Sony Ericsson add support for those to their feature phones. The Picsel viewer makes wonders for other brands such as Samsung and LG.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a message in fullscreen mode and changing the font size (small, medium, large) are handy options. There is a separate Manage email application, with the same structure and features as the one for SMS.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Walkman means great Multimdia<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W890 features the Walkman 3.0 player with the SensMe feature. The player supports MP3, AAC, AAC+, E-AAC+, WAV, M4A, G-MIDI 1, SP-MIDI, RealAudio 8, iMelody and XMF file formats and sports the MegaBass equalizer preset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are not willing to use the media player step-by-step interface, you can directly play a file through the file manager with its classic flat structure. It's a shame Sony Ericsson W890 doesn't offer additional player skins.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On one hand, they are developing lovely flash themes, a few new ones found in each new release with revamped menus and effects, and on the other, the player doesn't get a single spare Walkman outfit for the weekends. We do hope our test unit only missed extra player skins because of its beta status.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SensMe is a completely new way of browsing music, which debuted in Sony Ericsson W910.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching collections and creating playlists based on tempo and mood is the focus, instead of the well known artist or album filters. The interface is original and visually appealing, tracks appearing as dots in a dual plane, placed along a horizontal and vertical axis. This way you can circle a group of tracks that match your mood to create a playlist, or simply select individual tunes if you prefer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You are also able to broaden or shrink the selection of tracks with the navigation key. An alternative for the phone's more conventional music catalogue, SensMe is the way to discover music that matches your current mood. If music on the W890 is uploaded via the Media Manager PC software, mood is directly assigned to each track. You are not able to assign it yourself. Furthermore, if you simply copy tracks trough the regular file browser, they will remain "unseen" for the SensMe matrix, so you are obliged to use the Media Manager to get the mood stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another shortcoming is that managing music with Media Manager requires the phone to be set to Transfer mode, in which the phone is off for calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Media center menu lists the Photo, Music, Video, and Settings icons. The current pick is highlighted and the count of included files is displayed. The Media center is also accessible through the sixth icon in the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu is simple - you may opt for portrait or landscape view. In Media center you are able to sort music by even more filters beside the SenseMe - year, genre, albums, tracks, playlists, podcasts, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are willing to find a particular song, but know just a part of its name, don't worry, just type it in track list and the phone will automatically find and display it. If you're not using some of the music options, you can disable them in the options menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player, previously found in the entertainment sector, is now accommodated in the media center as well. It supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, as well as playing clips in slow motion. The interface is simple but stylish, although it fails to impress from a functional point of view. Again, the video files are accessible via the file manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated FM radio of Sony Ericsson W890 has memory for 20 preset stations and supports RDS.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>We really dig the image gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery is accessible through the Media center, it's the third application in the list and has the following submenu items: Latest Photo, Camera Album, Photo Tags, and Pictures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Latest Photo provides quick access to most recent pics. Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year. When a month is open, it reveals a 4 x 3 grid of thumbs of photos. Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the respective month. The highlighted photo is a bit larger for better viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures section opens again as a 4 x 3 grid of thumbs with non-camera images, like the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the full screen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Photo gallery is a convenient tool for managing a vast collection of camera photos with great customization capabilities. Photo Tags is a feature for displaying previously marked favorite photos. Pressing Up on the navigation key offers quick access to sending options like: send as Picture Msg, send as email, send to blog, and send via Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, you can set a photo as wallpaper, screen saver, startup image, and contact picture straight from the gallery. Here is the Pan and Zoom option and the slideshow function, revealed when you further scroll down the submenu. Slideshows in W890 are just fine - before they start you are asked to pick a mood and the handset plays the animated slide shows with background music to suit the chosen mood. The transition style of the slideshow also varies according to the mood.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing the photos is smooth, with the next image quickly popping up upon sliding from left or right. This is a minor but pleasant novelty in the Media Center application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, picture browsing via the classic file manager is still possible, only missing timeline view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a photo in PhotoDJ is just the same nice experience with plenty of available options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can zoom in to the actual size of a picture or even beyond. Extreme zooming in won't really reveal more details. All you'd get are smudged spots as a result of the extrapolation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We were pleased to find that viewing images one by one didn't involve any lags at all and browsing is fully comparable to the one in the high-end W910.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The camera has got a 3.2 megapixel upgrade<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W890 has a 3.2 megapixel camera with no autofocus, nor flash. The user interface is Cyber-shot SE v2.0, as seen in W910. The major benefits are the pop-up sub-menus enhanced with icons and the Multi Menu packing all the available settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a toolbar with options, including shooting mode, picture size, night mode, self-timer, white balance, effects, and the all-encompassing Multi Menu. The Settings Multi Menu looks pretty much the same as in standard digicam menus. All the camera settings are displayed in two menu columns: the left displays the features and the right shows which setting is in use. Pressing OK on the navigation key lists all options of a certain feature. The settings on the menu are: Picture Quality, Review, Save to, Shutter sound and Reset counter. Stabilizer, ISO settings and BestPic are not present here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera is not worth admirations, especially if compared to a Cyber-Shot handset. It will do the job for basic imaging and showing places you have visited but nothing more. Its fixed focus does OK at distances no closer than a meter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lack of detail is an underlying drawback; still colors come out relatively well. The produced images are tangibly noisy, regardless of the shooting conditions. Purple fringes are also clearly visible, especially in high contrast scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W890 comes with a Photo Fix application that provides a quick remedy for some of the picture defects. It is integrated into the camera interface, so a picture can be fixed right after it was taken. The videos taken with W890 have a maximum QVGA resolution and are recorded at 15fps in MPEG-4 format. This level of video quality just passes acceptable by our standards. In contrast, the video interface is nice and comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The functionality of the secondary video-call camera is adequate. The other party's video feed is viewed in a large frame in the middle of the screen, while you view your own image in a small frame in the lower left corner. You can also have your image in mirror-like view, which is much more natural. 2x digital zoom on your image is also available, as well as the option to replace your live video feed with a picture of your preference. You can also do that during an actual video call and it's handy when, for example, you want to show the person at the other end an interesting picture you've taken. The options don't end here. You can further control the exposure compensation of the camera or even switch it into night mode. There are 3 different video quality modes: picture quality, standard, and motion.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing is cool with the latest browser version<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Besides HSDPA, UMTS, GPRS and HSCSD for medium to fast data transfers, video calls and content-streaming, the handset offers the usual connectivity capabilities such as USB and Bluetooth with A2DP support. Sony Ericsson lacks WiFi and infrared.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson uses the traditional Access NetFront HTML browser, this time with the latest 3.4 version. The main improvement here is the integrated virtual mouse pointer. It is a real pleasure to work with and even the small font doesn't spoil the user-friendly browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting and practical feature is the "Find on page" option. When selected, a rectangular window at the bottom of the screen appears. The search is done by gradual typing and the first match is immediately highlighted. More results are available after hitting the find key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than these improvements, the browser does the usual good job and has enough of the other familiar options - you can view the pages fullscreen with no menus showing and you can even browse your Web pages in landscape mode. It has WAP and picture modes. It supports content created for HTML 4.01, xHTML 1.0, CSS and Java script, WAP 2.0. The supported security protocols are SSL/TLS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also browse sites in pan &amp; zoom mode, and it works much like zooming photos. There's a connectivity sub-menu added, where you can set the preferred connection, default page, or local connection. The NetFront web browser offers an RSS-feed reader, accessible through the main page of the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Smart-fit function of the browser does well fitting the web content onto the screen, but you may not find it so cool if you prefer to browse sites in a standard way. Scrolling is fast once the page has loaded completely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W890 supports Bluetooth 2.0 with the Human Interface Device (HID) profile, which allows the phone to be used as a remote control for PC and other Bluetooth-enabled devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Furthermore, the phone could be used as a Bluetooth modem for accessing the Internet on a PC or notebook computer. Bluetooth support also includes the A2DP profile, allowing listening to music on a stereo Bluetooth headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The W890 supports local and remote synchronization of contacts and calendar events. The local one is with Outlook and a PC, the other works with remote servers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In a USB connection the phone has three modes. You can opt for file transfer or USB Internet, which, simply put, is for using the phone as a modem. The media transfer profile is present too, which directly connects to the Windows media player, and gives full access to tracks placed on your phone for synchronization, play or sorting in playlists.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Location services and knowing your way around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Before proceeding with the description of the usual applications and organizing functions, where no novelties are noticed, we would like to pay due attention to the Location services application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Available for free download and compatible with a variety of mobile OS and Java-enabled handsets, the Google Maps for Mobile come preinstalled in the W890. With Location services you can get help finding your way, view information about your current location and save your favorite locations. To use all features of the Location services internet access is a must.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After defining a start and end location, the possible routes are being calculated with overall guidance, based on the available information in the database. With the GPS Enabler HGE-100, plugged in, Location service gets full GPS functionality, as well as A-GPS for faster satellite lock. This makes it possible to use navigation on the go, with turn-by-turn guidance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Two different views are available - Satellite and map view. Traffic information is another important feature here. The user interface is nice and intuitive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a plugged in GPS receiver, the Status info application displays the current activity in km/h for a 60 minutes period. The GPS connection status is indicated on the second tab of this application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, saving your most recent routes is as easy as it could be. Within several clicks, a title, description and position is all you need to save a favorite location.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The W890 is really feature rich in terms of applications<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson W890 offers the traditional time-management features. There is an Organizer icon in the main menu and it contains several applications: File manager, Alarms, Applications, Video call, Calendar, Tasks, Notes, Synchronization, Timer, Stopwatch, Calculator, and Code memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you enter a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tasks can be two types: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages; T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms are part of the main menu. There are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can opt to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week, as well as everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm's behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the free memory available the only restriction. The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson application. It offers the basic functions, no bells and whistles. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the well known basic applications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some other applications in the Entertainment menu include the MusicDJ, VideoDJ, TrackID and voice recorder. VideoDJ is for making your own video clips by mixing already existing ones with still pictures, text and a variety of effects or for making basic cuts using special transitions and adding background music. This can be a very entertaining, indeed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MusicDJ is a very simple application for creating custom polyphonic melodies.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for additional applications, the Sony Ericsson W890 comes only with the Music Mate 4 preinstalled.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Playing Sims 2 on your mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are three games preinstalled in Sony Ericsson W890 - Lumines Block, Sims 2 and Tennis Multiplayer. Lumines Block is a Tetris inspired game, Sims 2 is the mobile version of the largely popular strategic life simulation PC game. The Tennis Multiplayer is a classic tennis game with several player modes, including Bluetooth gaming with another Bluetooth-enabled phone.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Walkman lineup is diverse enough to cater to all tastes in terms of design and functionality. With the W890 we have a nice update in the slim bar form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the compact and amiable W880, and we believe the W890 is a welcome successor. It does address some of the major letdowns in the older W880: the tiny keys and the lack of FM radio. The user interface of the high-end W910 and the added HSDPA and quad-band GSM support are a commendable effort to set the Sony Ericsson W890 above its predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We expected a bit more from the camera, the size of the display and the loudspeaker performance. The missing Shake Control and auto-rotate capability may also raise a brow or two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson W890 is an undoubted improvement over the W880 but we can't help being wary. We frowned at the overpriced tag of W910, never mind its high-end status. Let's hope the asking price won't kill the appeal of Sony Ericsson W890. The neat and compact handset is a worthy offering for its solid feel, nice handling and good feature set.</paragraph>
