		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Circulating in the rumor mill for two years, with a probability of near zero for the better part thereof, the iPad Pro was made official in September 2015 and is shipping worldwide as we speak. Guess we already know what's been going on under the surface but the bottom line is Apple lets you decide about the optional pencil and keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 12.9 inches of display diagonal, the iPad Pro is Apple's largest tablet and largest handheld device running iOS, considering there are a couple of smaller MacBooks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But while size quite obviously matters, there's more to the giant iPad than its sheer scale. A couple of firsts for Apple are also part of the package, though they naturally come at an extra cost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First up is the Pencil. It's an easy target of ridicule, given Steve Jobs' abhorrence of the stylus, expressed at the original iPhone's launch. However, the Pencil here serves a fundamentally different purpose to a stylus on a smartphone, and the jokes are mostly groundless. The Pencil is an active battery powered device and houses all the tech needed for precise measurement of not only different levels of pressure, but also tilt, so that it's able to reproduce your drawing digitally with all its nuances as you would expect from say, a specialized Wacom tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's the Smart Keyboard that's more entertaining, however, at least for us. Well, depending on which side of the line you are in the so-called  Surface tension. If you need it to, the iPad Pro can be equipped with a foldable keyboard dock/kickstand, which you can buy separately, just like you would the Apple Pencil.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Done with the trivia, the iPad Pro is a seriously capable machine with a huge display, a formidable A9X chip and 4GB of RAM, all powered by an extra large battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Pro carries a few inherent flaws. There's little that could be done about the weight - a device with a large display will inevitably be heavy. We're not too fond of proprietary ports either, or closed ecosystems, rich as they may be in content and apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The matter of base storage is another common issue with Apple devices - just like the iPhone should drop the 16GB option and start at 32GB instead, the iPad Pro has little excuse not to have 64GB in its base model, let alone at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple insists that if you're getting the Wi-Fi-only version, you won't be wandering the streets, so there's no GPS. There's also no protection against the elements either, but would you really be taking something the size of a small TV poolside?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, let's stick to the routine. Join us on the next page for the usual unboxing and hardware overview.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Typical Apple retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad Pro comes in your Apple-standard plain white retail box. Barely larger than the tablet itself, the box contains a 2.4A AC adapter and a 2-meter-long USB-to-lightning cable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Hardware overview<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad Pro is your regular iPad, only larger. Okay, actually a lot larger. The idea was that the iPad Pro should be as wide as the iPad Air 2 is tall - in terms of display size and resolution, that is. Obviously, bezel placement means that the physical height of the "tiny" 9.7-inch Air 2 exceeds the Pro's dimension along the X axis.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Pro measures 305.7 x 220.6 x 6.9mm, which is about a centimeter more in both directions, compared to an A4 sheet of paper (a little narrower and taller than the Letter format). As such, it's actually smaller than an A4 clipboard, which is a nice way to put its dimensions in perspective.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not really as light as a clipboard though, at 713g for the Wi-Fi version and 723g for the cellular variant. That said, it weighs some 50g less than a competing Surface Pro 4, but that one has a kickstand built in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, conceptually the iPad Pro carries all the familiar traits of the lineup, only on a different scale. The display is obviously bigger, but bezels have remained mostly unchanged, compared to the Air 2. Top and bottom, they're the same, the side ones are marginally wider to allow for more grip area, presumably.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's little of note on the face of the device - it's as minimalist as the entire range of iPads. You have the front-facing camera centered above the display and the TouchID home button on the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back has the same brushed metal finish as Apple's entire recent range of devices, a Silver color option in our case. It gets a proportionately bigger fruit logo (still not lit, sorry), iPad branding and the mandatory certifications. The camera hasn't moved from its customary position in the top left corner either, a mic next to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right side high up is the volume rocker, again, as on any other iPad, with another mic pinhole.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the left, you'll spot the three-pin connector for the Smart Keyboard dock. This one is positioned in the center to power the keyboard and get input from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The power button is in the right corner at the top - similar to the rest of the iPads. On the very far end is the 3.5mm jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What's unlike any other iPad is the number and placement of the speakers. The iPad Pro has a total of four of those, positioned on either end of the top and bottom. The grilles for either of them are familiar, but in this case each consists of nine holes. Yes, not 14 as on the iPad Air 2, and not 8 as on the iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Such minute details aside, the four speakers promise loud sound and guarantee that however you're holding the slate, you'd be left with at least two of them unobstructed by your palms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lightning connector is right in the middle on the bottom, exactly where you'd expect to find it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A very important subject with such an unwieldy slate, handling the iPad Pro is a two-handed affair. Holding the iPad Pro with just one hand poses all sorts of problems. For one, it's heavy. In landscape you have the larger top or bottom bezel to hold on to with your thumb, but then the center of gravity of the tablet is far enough to put some serious stress on the said digit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rotate into portrait and the center of gravity comes a lot closer, but the side bezels don't give you enough room to hang on to, without touching the display. Now, the software does work well to interpret what's a tap and what's your thumb doing the balancing, but either way, it's right there blocking the view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You could also place the slate on your palm entirely without holding on to the front, but the finish of the back is slippery enough that you wouldn't want to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The TouchID home button is best accessed in landscape orientation with either of your thumbs - it's placed right where you're likely to be holding the device. That said, it's somewhat odd to have the home button on the side. In portrait, you're more likely to be reaching for it with the index finger of one hand, while holding the tablet with the other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What certainly helps handling in general is that the iPad Pro is thin. Okay, it's not iPad Air-thin, but the 6.9mm do help offset some of the weight and footprint disadvantages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We don't have a standardized bending test rig, nor do we consider such exercises entirely justified. That said, the iPad Pro feels solid and positively not prone to bending under its intended usage scenarios.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>12.9-inch IPS panel<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Pro comes with a 12.9-inch IPS display with a resolution of 2,048 x 2,732 pixels. Again, the logic was for the Pro to have as many pixels in the horizontal direction as the Air has in the vertical, and the 4:3 ratio did the rest. Hence, the pixel density is the same - 264ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At its maximum setting, the iPad Pro display is not as bright (395nits) as the iPad Air 2 (458nits), but thanks to the much deeper blacks, the resulting contrast ratio (1458:1) is a lot higher than that of any of the other iPads we've reviewed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of color rendering, the iPad Pro is sufficiently geared to show accurate colors (Avg DeltaE 6.4) though we wouldn't go as far as using it for color critical work (you'd need all colors to stay below DeltaE 4) for that. We're not quite sure how that would go with the professional aspirations of the device, which supposedly should make it a preferred tool for creatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Pro we have at hand is the Wi-Fi-only version. It supports dual-channel 2.4GHz&amp;5.0GHz 802.11a/b/g/n/ac connectivity with multiple antennas for higher-capacity link (or MIMO).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those who insist on cellular connectivity have the sole option of getting the 128GB version, the one with cellular radios. It supports quad-band 2G and a multitude of 3G and LTE bands. This is the only version that supports GPS as well, but it also has GLONASS support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the cellular version Apple is also bundling an Apple SIM. It allows a single carrier-agnostic SIM to connect to AT&amp;T, Sprint or T-Mobile in the US, Everything Everywhere (EE) in the UK, as well as GigSky-partnering carriers in 90 countries the world over.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Either way, you're getting Bluetooth v4.2, with iBeacon too. There's no NFC, though and no support for using it on physical terminals with Apple Pay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wired connectivity takes place through the Lightning connector, which also complies with USB 3.0 standards. There's a standard 3.5mm headphone jack as well, but you need to supply your own headphones as there are none included.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop is available in every share menu throughout iOS. You can send pictures, videos, App Store and iTunes links, Notes, Maps links, all kind of files from file managing apps (i.e. Filer, Flash Drive, Air Disk, etc.), Office docs, and more. If there are people with an active AirDrop service around you, they will automatically appear in the dedicated AirDrop field. You just mark your files, select the recipient and hit the send key.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPad Pro battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad Pro has a 10,307mAh battery, split into 2 cells, as teardowns revealed. The closest tablet rival, a 2-year-old Samsung Galaxy Note 12.2 (2014) has a 9,500mAh capacity, but also some 16% less of screen real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple promises 10 hours of the web browsing or video playback and it's half right. In our web browsing test the tablet crossed the 10-hour mark with a few minutes to spare, but fell two and a half hours short at video playback. We appreciate that battery endurance leans towards web browsing, as the 4:3 ratio is infinitely better suited to reading, than watching videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 with its 7340mAh battery is good for a similar 10 hours of web browsing, but a substantially longer video playback of almost 12 hours. The Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 did about nine and a half hours in both tests, when we tested one a little short of two years ago.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you're interested in the nitty-gritties.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Mutli-window is great on the big screen<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Pro runs on iOS 9.1, the latest version of Apple's OS for mobile devices. It's the largest and most powerful iOS family member to date, and we don't see that changing any time soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen brings no surprises. You swipe right (and only right) to unlock, and there's also a camera shortcut, which bypasses the unlocking process. Once you're done with the picture-taking business though, you can't access the interface, without properly unlocking, so you're still safe. Lockscreen notifications are available as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can passcode-protect the lockscreen and also set up finger-lock thanks to Touch ID. The Touch ID sensor offers 360-degree readability translating into effortless scanning of your fingerprint. That's good, because you'll be handling the giant tablet in all sorts of orientations, and TouchID-ing will work in every direction. You can commit up to five fingerprint samples, and you're likely to use up most of those for yourself, so that you don't have to think which way you're holding the tablet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For when your fingers are unreadable, you have the passcode to access your device. Hence, enabling passcode is a mandatory requirement in order to use Touch ID.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iPad Pro doesn't have NFC and it can't be used for Apple Pay at merchant locations, not that its bulk really allows it. However, you'll still be able to use Apple Pay for in-app purchases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This is an iPad so all of your apps are on the homescreen. You can, of course, group them in folders and there is the familiar dock that can take up to six permanently visible shortcuts. Pages are available in the folders, each page can pack up to sixteen apps and there is no limit on the page count.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the huge screen estate feels squandered. Icons are few and far between, even if their size looks about right - the 4x5 grid is downright ridiculous. The dock looks like it can handle a few more apps in landscape, but in portrait would get cluttered, so 6 is good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Swiping from the top down will display the Notifications center. It has two panes, the left one replaces the Today tab on previous iPads and has a large date and calendar events. The right pane has two tabs, one for widgets, the other - for the actual notifications. The selection of widgets is decidedly limited, though, and depends on the applications you have installed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, you can choose which apps you want to show up in the pull-down Notifications and in what order. The Today tab is customizable, and you can disable its elements one by one - everything but the date displayed at the top can be removed so it doesn't get in the way. You can even disable the Today tab altogether in the Notification Center for the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is reserved for notifications only. Other than that, the handling of notifications hasn't changed a bit. You can opt to disable a notification, set it to be a banner, which will shortly pop up over the status bar or an alert showing up at the center of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also options to disable badges on app icons or disable lockscreen notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Control center is the same as on regular iPads - with controls for music, a volume slider, a brightness slider, a camera shortcut, a timer shortcut, AirDrop menu and six toggles for Airplane mode, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Do Not Disturb, Silent and Rotation lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task-switcher interface is evoked with a double press on the Home key. All apps are presented with cards, which are nothing short of huge but can easily be swiped up to close. You wouldn't expect to see a Kill all button, but we'll say it - there isn't one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The parallax effect is present on the homescreen. Apple designed iOS on independent layers - background, homescreen icons, icon badges, and then app pop-ups. The iPad Pro then uses its accelerometer and gyroscope to move layers independently and create an illusion of depth. The movement is very subtle on smaller screens, but pretty visible on the 12.9-inch Pro. In case you don't like the parallax effect you can turn it off from an unlikely setting item - you will find it in Accessibility settings -&gt; Reduce Motion.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Settings menu has the same layout as in previous iPad versions - it's a split screen list of settings and is pretty neat to get around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Do Not Disturb mode is available on the iPad Pro too. It gives users further control over notifications, or rather their suppression. If turned on, it will mute incoming FaceTime calls or app alerts. You can allow FaceTime calls from your favorite contacts and have the option to set a specific time interval in which you won't get any notifications.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a dedicated toggle to activate the DND feature on demand and it can be customized in the Notifications submenu. When Do Not Disturb is on, a crescent icon appears next to the clock in the status bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since iOS 7 Apple ushered in its take on true background multitasking, aptly called Background App Refresh. The way it works is all apps will work in the background, but iOS will learn which one of them you use most often and when and have their content refreshed with priority or around the time of day you usually check them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apps also update in the background when push notifications come in. All apps that use Cellular/Wi-Fi connection and can work in the background are listed under Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Background App refresh.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The four/five-finger multi-tasking gestures are also available on the iPad Pro. You can switch between the active apps using four (or five)-finger swipes. A similar swipe to the top will bring you the task switcher. Finally, you can use four (or five as it feels more natural) finger pinch zoom out. It will bring you the homescreen, while the app will go in background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is mostly unchanged from previous iterations, but a feature introduced with iOS 9.0 shines on the iPad Pro. Split-screen multitasking is essential on such a large display, and thanks to the powerful chipset and 4GB of RAM works as fluid as ever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It goes like this. First, you need to have an app opened fullscreen - you can't start from the homescreen. So, say you're browsing in Safari, but want to take a quick look at your calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An inward swipe from the right edge first brings up an overlay pane with the available apps, Safari gets grayed out in the background. You tap on calendar and it fills the overlay. The right pane has a handle on the left, tap that and Safari comes back up, the two windows now equally lit up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This secondary app that you have on the right can be stretched to take up to half the screen, but that's it - you can't make it the dominant one and squish the original app (in this case Safari) further to the left. You also can't swap the two apps, should you decide that the Calendar deserves more attention - you need to hit home and launch it from the homescreen. Also, for whatever reason, you can't have two instances of the same app side by side (mostly applicable to the browser).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the feature is nice and finally allows to do two concurrent tasks simultaneously, and for a while there we didn't think we'd see an iOS device do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We would certainly appreciate it if the feature loses its one-sided nature and can be accessed from either edge of the screen. Swapping the two apps is a no-brainer for a future update, too. It's refreshing to see strides being taken in making productivity more than a buzz word used in marketing material.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad Pro is powered by Apple's A9X chip, which Apple says has a 64-bit desktop-class architecture. A few charts, shown at the launch event, detailed the advancements in Apple's tablet performance, and the Pro is said to pack a CPU 1.8 times more powerful than the one in the iPad Air 2 and a GPU twice as powerful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ran the usual tests on the iPad Pro to see just how this almighty chip compares against the rest, and we struggled a little with finding what to compare it against. For one, there aren't many tablets with such giant displays, certainly not outside of the proper desktop Windows OS realm.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android-running Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 / Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 come to mind but they are 2 years old now, and instead of updating them Samsung seems to be focused on making kitchen tablets. So we rounded up the latest tablets we've tested, regardless of display size, and threw in some of the flagship phones of late.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Geekbench the iPad Pro scored nearly 5,500 points, which is on par with our current Android champ, the Meizu Pro 5. Samsung flagships with the same chip have been tweaked differently and score lower. However, the more intriguing bit here is single-core performance, and a single 2.26GHz Twister core scores upwards of 3,400 - as much as the dual-core 2.3GHz Denver CPU inside the Nexus 9.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, Apple's claim for a 1.8x performance improvement over the iPad Air 2, doesn't seem to hold true, at least not in Geekbench - it's more like 20-something percent. The Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet scores almost identical to the iPad Air 2, hence it trails the iPad Pro. The aging Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is no match for any of the current powerhouses.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Antutu, the iPad Pro still can't beat the Meizu Pro 5, but does leave the other Exynos 7420 devices behind. It also comfortably outpaces the newest Galaxy Tab S2 9.7. The current-gen iPhones score noticeably lower too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Basemark II 2.0, however, the iPad Pro is without competition. The iPhone 6s/6s duo come closest, but still post substantially lower scores.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Graphics tests paint the picture of an extremely powerful GPU. Acing the offscreen part in GFXBench 3.0 Manhattan, the iPad Pro's score drops significantly for the onscreen test. It still scores an excellent 29.4fps, and don't forget that the GPU needs to push some 5.6 million of pixels worth of resolution. The aging Galaxy Note 12.2 scores a meagre 2.2fps in comparison.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Basemark Metal should yield cross-platform-comparable results with its Basemark ES 3.1 Android counterpart. Here the iPad Pro is in a league of its own, scoring twice as high as the iPhones, which are in turn miles ahead of anything Android has to offer right now.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark ES 3.1 / Metal<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In web browsing, the iPad Pro delivers as well. It only managed to run the JavaScript Kraken benchmark, but it passed with flying colors, scoring higher than the iPhone 6s and miles ahead of Android flagships. Our other usual test - Browsermark - was unfortunately a no-go on Apple's tablet, just like it was on the iPhone 6s.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Kraken 1.1<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the iPad Pro aced all tests and proved that Apple has indeed built some serious hardware into it. There's hardly a tablet on the market now with more punch - at least one running a mobile OS, that is.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple's gallery is called Photos and includes the now familiar Search option. The smart suggestions implemented within the new Spotlight and Safari browser work here too. You can search by place, date, people, nearby location, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like before, images are organized by date and location, for those that have been geo-tagged. This view is called Moments. You can go a step back, to Collections view where you can better view your sorted photos into groups with labels and much smaller thumbs. Finally, there is the Year view. It squeezes your collection into tight grids for each year.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Recently Deleted album is available on the iPad Pro as well. It stores your recently erased photos for 30 days before deleting them for good. Each photo shows the days remaining until deletion. It works like a recycle bin and, of course, you can restore the files you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Shared photos are available - the tab has all your Photo streams. Photo Stream, which acts like a social sub-network, works really well and is very simple to set up. You choose what pictures to share and which people to share with. Your buddies on the receiving end will be able to like them and post comments. You can invite users you want to share your Photo Streams with via email or get invited. If you are using the new Family Sharing options you can easily configure Photo Streams shared between your homegroup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If your iCloud Drive is active you can gain access to your cloud gallery and browse it on the iPad Pro without the need of storing it locally. If you have opted to store everything in your iCloud Drive, you can save precious space and still have access to your images and videos. You'll need a working internet connection, of course, and the iCloud Drive free quota is only 5GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a simple, yet powerful integrated image editor. It supports standard features such as crop, rotate and filters, but it also offers advanced settings allowing full control over light (exposure, highlights, shadows, brightness, contrast, black point), color (saturation, contrast, cast), black &amp; white (intensity, neutrals, tone, grain). In case you aren't into meddling with your photos, you can use the new intelligent Auto Enhance feature, which will do things automatically for you.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The music player hasn't changed its white, flat looks but has gained new functionality. You can create playlists, delete songs right from within the player and reorder tabs whichever way you like. Album view is available too - you access it by flipping the device landscape. It lists all the covers to the albums you have in your library. Tapping on an album thumb lists all the tracks in it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Now Playing screen hasn't changed in functionality neither is the settings. Nine major releases into the iOS' existence, it still fails to offer configurable equalizers, so you're left with the "only" 23 presets.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The videos app allows you to upload only supported formats via iTunes or purchase videos from the iTunes store. This is an extremely disappointing showing by a platform that is supposed to excel at multimedia consumption.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lack of extra functionality is bad enough, but having to use just an extremely limited number of media formats or resorting to converting files, which is both slow and inconvenient is a real deal-breaker.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A new feature lets you watch videos in an overlay window above the rest of the interface. You play the video from the Videos app, press the home button and it continues playing in a picture-in-picture fashion. You can resize the window with a pinch gesture and it tends to stick to one of the corners of the display, of course respecting other interface elements (in this case the dock).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A quartet of loudspeakers<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple has really gone to great lengths designing the loudspeaker setup of the iPad Pro. A total of four drivers are installed, with spacious enclosures on the inside, aiming to achieve a depth of sound unrivaled by the usual tinny speakers. Machined into the frame, the resonance chambers are said to deliver "three times the acoustic output of iPad Air", Apple claims.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's not all. Depending on how you're holding the iPad Pro, the software will automatically adjust the sound output, so the higher frequencies come out of the top pair of speakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In our standardized loudspeaker test, which doesn't take into account such fancy setups, the iPad Pro scored a Good rating. Measured numbers aside, the output is truly powerful, with no distortion at maximum volume and really deep bass, for a tablet of course.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Apple iPad Pro did splendidly in our audio quality test. When docked to an active external amplifier, it produced stellar audio, scoring greatly in every part of the test. Its volume levels were impressively high too for an all-round flawless performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The stereo crosstalk degradation when you plug in a pair of headphones is moderate and since none of the other readings are affected, the iPad Pro is shaping up as a device every audiophile will appreciate.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Okay 8MP camera, using it looks plain awkward<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iPad Pro comes with an 8MP primary camera on the back, capable of shooting images at 3,264 x 2,448 pixels in resolution. The lens is a 31mm-equivalent with an f/2.4 aperture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface remains unchanged from smaller iPads. You can switch between modes by a simple swipe, and when shooting stills you can adjust exposure compensation with a tap and slide. There's a front/rear camera toggle, as well a shortcut to the gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a manual HDR mode which by default saves the regular non-HDR shot as well. Holding the virtual shutter button will shoot a burst sequence at 10fps indefinitely, or until you run out of storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resulting images are good overall, with the due notice that we're talking about a tablet. There's a nice level of detail for an 8MP camera, but there's also quite a lot of noise in patches of uniform color. Colors are pleasant without being over-the-top saturated. The iPad Pro exhibits a tendency to underexpose, which, coupled with the somewhat limited dynamic range, often leaves shadows too dark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HDR mode pulls some detail from the shadows and introduces a drop in contrast, but the effect is subtle and images look natural. The added benefit of having the regular shot to choose between the two is also nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's the usual excellent panorama mode. Shot in portrait, the panoramas can be as tall as the camera's resolution in this direction - 3,284 pixels. That's the ideal case though, if you manage to stay precisely on axis when turning. About 100 pixels less is a reasonable expectation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A 150-degree rotation yielded a 29.6MP image, which weighed in at around 7.3MB. Stitching exhibits a few noticeable flaws - jaggies in straight objects nearby are to be expected, but the banding in the sky is more unpleasant, likely due to the difficult high-contrast conditions. Still, a top result as panoramas go.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Good 1080p videos<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording on the iPad Pro can be done in either 1080p or 720p both at 30fps. There's also a slow motion mode, recorded at 720p/120fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The regular 1080p videos are show good detail levels - not exceptional, but quite satisfactory. Colors and exposure are accurate, but dynamic range is pretty limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also directly download the 1080p@30fps video sample.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Safari<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Courtesy of iOS 8 the iPad Safari web browser welcomes third-party developers too. It now supports extension access via its contextual menu. They will be able to auto-fill forms, use the Touch ID security features and translate webpages. It's up to the developers to come up with creative uses and hopefully we'll get a lot of those soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than the Safari extensions, Apple has improved its Private Browsing. It's more intuitive now and won't make you convert all of your currently opened tabs into Private ones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Safari supports the iCloud keychain where you can store all of your passwords and credit card info (sans the security code). There is also a password generator available, in case you are out of ideas. What's good about this setup is that all your save content from the computer version of Safari is now available straight on your phone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In much the same way, iCloud syncs your opened tabs, along with offline reading. Safari also allows you access to your multimedia content without exiting the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like before, if a page is compatible with the integrated Reader (most of the article pages out there are) you get a Reader button right into the address bar as soon as the page loads. The Reader strips the webpage of ads and makes the layout and font size more suited to a smaller phone screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text Input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Moving on to the keyboard. The QuickType predictive input will learn from your typing pattern, vocabulary, people you write often to and topics. It will eventually understand the subject of each thread and base suggestions on whether the communication is formal or casual.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Apple says the algorithm is really smart in understanding meaning and in suggesting prompt responses. We have got to say though that many competitive keyboards on other platforms are already doing similar things plus they are swype-enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Siri-powered dictation is available pretty much in any app that supports keyboard input. You need just to hit the corresponding button on your keyboard and start dictating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can undock the keyboard, which places it dead center on the screen. You can then move it up or down, depending on what's underneath and where you would like to place it. Unlike regular iPads, you can can't split the keyboard in two for operation with both thumbs - apparently Apple doesn't consider it a viable typing option, and frankly, neither do we.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In landscape tablet orientation the keyboard is a near full size affair, though it remains awkward to type without any mechanical feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the absence of 3D touch tech, precise cursor placement is done with a double finger tap and swipe - it seems to work equally well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>iTunes and App stores<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The iTunes store is where you get music, videos, TV shows, movies, podcasts and ringtones. The tabbed interface is similar to that of the AppStore, divided into Music, Movies, Search, Tones and More.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The App store on the iPad Pro has a better and smarter search with a new interface, App Bundles offered by devs, embedded videos in the app descriptions a la Google Play Store, and devs are able to invite users to closed beta testing of new versions of their apps.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>iCloud Drive is present on the iPad Pro, as well. Besides backing up your entire camera roll, it is instantly synced in the cloud and accessible from anywhere - your other iOS devices, Macs and PCs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can store any file on the iCloud Drive, not just pictures and videos, as any other services would allow you to. The Handoff feature relies heavily on the iCloud Drive - a document you've opened on your iPhone would be handed over to your iPad or Mac. If you don't use iCloud Drive this file continuity wouldn't be possible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can choose what files and app data gets synced in your iCloud Drive. There is an option to choose cellular data where a Wi-Fi connection isn't available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, Apple is still offering a free quota of only 5GB and it quickly gets used up by your iCloud backups, especially if those include the photos. If you want more space, you'll have to pay extra though the storage plans are actually reasonably priced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop is naturally available as well, for system-wide file sharing between supported iDevices (including Macs running OS X Maverics and above), which needs to have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>AirDrop is available in every share menu throughout the iOS. You can send pictures, videos, App Store and iTunes links, Notes, Maps links, all kind of files from file managing apps (i.e. Filer, Flash Drive, Air Disk, etc.), Office docs, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If there are people with AirDrop service around you, they will automatically appear in the dedicated AirDrop field. You just mark your files, select people and hit the send key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Present since iOS 8, Family Sharing allows up to six users to make iTunes, iBooks, and App Store purchases with a single credit card. Family photos, calendar entries and locations can also be shared.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The credit card owner and group admin may opt to authorize each purchase requested by other members in the group - i.e. your kids. Thus you have full control over the purchased content - same goes for sharing requests.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If Family Sharing is enabled on a range of devices, you will be able to find each one of them on a map - handy if you want to know where your kids (or spouse) are at any time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock and calendar apps are here. Clock can show you the time around the world, setup alarms, a timer and a stopwatch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calendar hasn't received any new functionality but remains great regardless. It can sync multiple calendar accounts at once, divide events by type (each type like Birthdays, Work, Family, etc. can be color-coded) and has the standard viewing modes - Day, Week, Month and Year. You also get an Agenda view under the search field which lists all the events in a timeline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Notes give you rich text formatting, while Reminders are just what you'd expect. You can schedule reminders for a time and even place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The iBooks is now part of the iOS package and has lost its skeuomorphic design. Its interface mimics that of the App Store, but the first tab is still your virtual bookshelf.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With every newly activated iPad Pro you also get the complete iWorks suite including Pages (viewing, editing docs), Numbers (viewing, editing excel files), and Keynote (viewing, editing presentations).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages allows you to import, create or edit documents (DOC and DOCX are supported). It isn't as powerful as some of its Android counterparts, but it covers all the basics and will do an excellent job for most users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keynote opens and edits (PowerPoint) presentations. It has all the tools you'll need to create a decent presentation from scratch, including tons of beautifully designed themes. You get comprehensive editing options including adding multimedia, tablets, charts and customizable transitions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Numbers supports working with spreadsheet files (read Excel) and also covers all major features you'll probably need - charts, formulas, tablet formatting, the lot. There are many themes that will help you quickly create complicated spreadsheets even if you don't know how to do a scatter chart (looking at how the templates work is a good way to learn).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iTunes U is a very powerful app few people use on a daily basis. It has a priceless catalogue of courses and lectures from many Universities in the world on just about any science you'd want to get into and is worth checking out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo Booth uses the new front-facing camera to create a series of effects. You can choose among them and the effect changes when you move your face in front of the camera.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apple iPad Pro key test findings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Excellent build, typical Apple premium quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 700g and change, the tablet can be held with one hand for a while, but you'd want to use two.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is sharp, looks good at an angle and has excellent contrast, maximum brightness isn't spectacular.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 10 hours and then some, web browsing delivers on Apple's promise for battery endurance, but the 7 and a half hours of video playback fall short.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>iOS 9.1 has seen little optimization for the huge screen diagonal, screen real estate looks wasted. Apple's first implementation of split-screen multitasking is genuinely useful, but also somewhat limited.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Blazing fast benchmark performance, hugely powerful GPU</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quartet of speakers scores a Good rating for loudness, audio is excellently clean, and very rich too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera shoots good images for a tablet snapper, but you don't look good in the process. Same goes for video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio quality is excellent, both with headphones and an external amp, very loud too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No 3D touch but the Apple pencil can detect multiple levels of pressure and tilt</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Apple's original iPad made the tablet a mainstream device, and for more than five years 9.7 inches was the largest diagonal iOS device available. Not anymore - we now have the iPad Pro, all 12.9 inches of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Simply scaling up an iPad couldn't cut it though, Apple had to make some conceptual changes. These come in the form of two previously scorned accessories - a stylus and a keyboard - making the iPad Pro a device aimed at professionals on the go (aren't we all).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That same breed however could ask the legitimate question whether a mobile OS device with all its inherent limitations is worth the same amount of money that could otherwise buy them a proper laptop with a fully-fledged desktop OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, Apple worked on OS features to make good use of the available screen real estate. Introduced with iOS 9.0, split-screen multitasking works intuitively and helps productivity, albeit in the one specific way Apple chose to execute it. Other than that, iOS on the Pro is very much like on the Air, only with homescreen icons spread further apart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Right now, the iPad Pro is perhaps the sole member of a peculiar breed. Samsung's large-screen tablets, the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 / Tab Pro 12.2 pair, come closest to Apple's slate concept - large diagonal, mobile OS, stylus input on the Note. They are 2 years old now though and nowhere near the iPad Pro in terms of performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Realistically speaking, the iPad Pro needs to fight against desktop OS competitors, especially with its hefty pricetag. The base model 13.3-inch MacBook Air with 128GB of storage costs $50 more than the Pro, but has a proper keyboard built-in, where the rubbery Smart Keyboard fetches an extra $169 on the tablet. The iPad Pro has a much sharper display though, and artists who need the Pencil indeed, won't find one for the MacBook. The iPad Pro wins on portability too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the keyboard is optional, there's the obvious archrival - the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. A member of a lineup, which some may consider Apple's inspiration for the iPad Pro, the Surface runs Windows 10, has storage options starting at 128GB, a pen bundled in the package and a built-in multi-position kickstand. It doesn't run OS X though, which may be a problem if you're invested in the Apple ecosystem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Value for money aside, the iPad Pro is a great 12.9-inch tablet. It looks good, handles well for its bulk and has a wonderful display. There isn't a more powerful iOS device you can buy, and neither is there an Android competitor to speak of. Well, there're perhaps a couple that match the description but not quite the execution and experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But pit the iPad Pro against desktop OS rivals and the limitations of the platform become evident. However, within the confines of iOS, the iPad Pro is one-of-a-kind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, to Apple that's probably more than enough to justify the price tag. The Pro is the most expensive handheld device in the Cupertino lineup and that's before the optional accessories. In a way, it's a good thing they don't force you to get the pencil and keyboard. Without them though, you don't get the productivity boost that would've justified the extra size and weight.</paragraph>
