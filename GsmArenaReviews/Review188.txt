			<paragraph>Samsung INNOV8 is back to our shop and quite ready to strut its stuff again. Not so long ago we saw it in heavy duty cameraphone action, it's now time to explore the whole package. And there's a lot. The ample TFT display, abundant storage space, latest Symbian OS and the 8 megapixel camera all promise a nice ride. Multimedia and entertainment won't go unnoticed either, to make it as fun as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The INNOV8 has already got a star on the 8 megapixel boulevard and might as well be eyeing Symbian domination. Here it goes, but watch out 'cause this thing rides fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A few 8 megapixel cameraphones are already cornering the market and you should be well on top of things if you keep track. Samsung i8510, better known by its stage name INNOV8, was first to hit the shelves and still the only one to run on Symbian. A powerful OS for a powerful handset, we should add. You can tell we are struck by the INNOV8 charisma, but don't worry, you will soon be too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung INNOV8 boasts one of the most capable 8 megapixel cameras and so rightfully earned the most feature balanced cameraphone recommendation in our recent 8 megapixel camera shootout. We're now about to have a closer look though at another two contenders, which share INNOV8's form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson C905 is a monster of a feature phone, which has GPS and Wi-Fi too, but fails to keep up in terms of multimedia features and screen size, let alone video recording. The price margin between C905 and the 8GB version of the INNOV8 is so slim it makes the Samsung INNOV8 a dead easy pick for your multimedia needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson C905</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KC780 by LG is another 8 megapixel slider but stakes are this time on affordability. Just made available, we are yet to see what it's made of.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  LG KC780</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Imaging prowess aside, there seem to be hardly any chinks in the INNOV8 armor its rivals can take advantage of and close the gap on Samsung's finest. The few weak spots are sheer size, price tag and probably the lack of an FM transmitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Frankly, we can't think of a real alternative in terms of size, as none of the more compact Symbians has a feature pack comparable to INNOV8's. Still, Nokia N79 and Nokia N85 might be considered, with bodies fitting every hand and specs to please most tastes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung's very own i7110 might also come into play here. All of those have FM transmitters but none of them is a match for INNOV8's 8 megapixel monster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia N79 ? Nokia N85 ? Samsung i7110</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We're talking Samsung's supreme Symbian device so we guess we can't do without a respectful nod to the Nseries top brass. Nokia N96 is trying to offset the lower-res camera with DVB-H support in what are otherwise identical spec sheets, give or take. N96 though is so steeply priced it loses some competitive edge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a budget standpoint Nokia N95 8GB is the more likely alternative. It's more compact, it packs the same screen as the INNOV8 and covers most of the functionality, save for the optical trackpad and the 8 megapixel shooter. At this point though N95 8GB saves you a good 100 euro (125 US dollars).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Nokia N96 ? Nokia N95 8GB</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, we've got a nice ride ahead and the V8 engine is keen to do its bit. So hop on, next stop looks and ergonomics.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of Samsung i8510 INNOV8 isn't quite what you'd expect in a high-end phone. Inside the box you will find a a two-piece wired headset, three different sizes of custom ear-buds and a DC charger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The enclosed hands-free set has a 3.5mm standard audio jack, which means you can easily replace the supplied headphones with a set of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the contents are the familiar paperwork and a mini CD with the required PC sync software (Samsung PC Studio). Bear in mind though that those packages have always been market dependant, so you should take our words with a pinch of salt.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 measures 106.5 x 53.9 x 17.2 mm and weighs 140 grams. Furthermore, with the slider up, the i8510 INNOV8 takes a shot at the tallest handset world record. It outstretches the Nokia N95 8GB by about 2 cm but we guess it is the price to pay for the functionality offered.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 has very conservative styling and that seems the right approach to a device of such size. It won't turn heads but handling and ergonomics will be widely appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We do like the black casing, matt on the rear and brushed on the keypad. The sliding action is firm and smooth, the remarkably long slider run never a burden with the spring loaded case.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the front, we find the loudspeaker grill dead center at the top. Alongside on the right are the ambient light sensor and video-call camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display takes most of the front but leaves enough room for a neat navigation block beneath. Six keys are lined around a nicely sized and tactile D-pad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Samsung G810, the INNOV8 has no labels on the Menu and Gallery key - the two silver knobs on the sides of the D-pad. However, you will get used to that in no time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the controls on the front panel are very user-friendly, offering great size and solid press. The D-pad center can be set to work as an optical trackpad letting you browse menus by finger sweeps. You can adjust its vertical and horizontal sensitivity to best suit your taste. The place where the optical trackpad really makes a difference is the web browser but we'll get to it in due time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Samsung i8510 INNOV8 hosts the microUSB port, 3.5mm standard audio jack and the volume keys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker doubles as a zoom lever and its location may seem a questionable ergonomic solution. Not everyone will like zoom control at the bottom. We for one don't think it's such a big deal. The rocker is very tactile and responsive, and falls right where your left thumb is when holding the device up to take a picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the very top of the left side is the lanyard eyelet. The good news is Samsung i8510 INNOV8 also uses the microUSB port for charging, which allows you to transfer data and recharge at the same time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right we find the camera key, the microSD card slot and the camera mode switch. The latter is in charge of toggling between still camera, camcorder and the image gallery much like on a digicam.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is remarkably soft and responsive, with a very distinct half press and full press. The camera mode switch is a bit rigid, the three stops less marked than we would've liked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top and the bottom of Samsung i8510 INNOV8 are neat, featuring no functional elements whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Turning the phone over we find the stereo speakers on either side of the 8 megapixel autofocus camera lens. There is a LED flash next to it but you may as well know from the shootout its performance is quite below-par. The camera lens is protected by a small automatic cover.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottommost piece of the rear slides out to release the battery cover and reveal the 1200 mAh Li-Ion battery. It has enough juice to keep the phone going for about two and a half days of quite extensive usage, which should be the case with most INNOV8 users. After all it's not a call-and-text phone we're dealing with, is it?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual battery cover is made of metal but you can't tell that at first sight. Only when you touch it can you feel the difference from the high-quality plastic used on the rest of the body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The projecting nest of the lens also features some metallic finish. The build quality of the i8510 INNOV8 is commendable and the handset looks quite set to hold up against the normal wear and tear. While not a finely crafted elegant set, the INNOV8 looks and feels extra solid, a neat balance between businesslike and gadgety.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Thumbs up for the display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 is equipped with a 2.8" 16M-color TFT LCD display of QVGA resolution. It managed to impress us with great brightness and contrast levels, contributing to excellent picture quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It isn't as impressive as the OLED screen on Nokia N85 but for an LCD the picture quality is excellent. Sunlight legibility is also notably improved over past Samsung handsets so we can hardly frown at the INNOV8 display.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Keypad is OK<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sliding the INNOV8 up does two things: it almost makes you think you can use the phone for shoveling the snow from your driveway and it reveals the alphanumeric keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, on a serious note, the INNOV8 sports a fairly comfortable flatbed keypad with large enough keys and very good press feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keypad styling is borrowed from the U900 Soul and performance is on par. The only difference is the top row of the alphanumeric keypad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Soul's dedicated video-call key and the Application Switch key - on either side of the C key - are now fully-customizable shortcuts to any application or even websites.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Symbian in Samsung skin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 runs on Symbian 9.3 with Series60 3rd Edition user interface and feature Pack 2 preinstalled. It is the same as what we found on the latest Nokia smartphones we reviewed - the N79 and N85 - the INNOV8 however offers somewhat less eye-candy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The layout is quite familiar with status icons appearing on the top of the screen and soft key labels at the bottom. The i8510 INNOV8 also supports Active standby with two different layouts to pick from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The active standby screen is a nice and convenient way of bringing shortcuts to all favorite applications to your home screen. You can even assign shortcuts to websites of your choice for quicker access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen can be organized in either vertical or horizontal tabs, which can then be scrolled with the D-pad. If active standby is disabled, the direction keys of the D-pad can also be assigned a shortcut of your choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Active standby or not, you can always change the shortcuts assigned to the two soft keys to best suit your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the built-in accelerometer Samsung i8510 INNOV8 enjoys screen auto rotation. However, for some reason Samsung have decided to disable Auto Pivot - the Samsung name for auto rotation - on the homescreen and in the main menu, so it only works in the applications and sub-menus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least they have kept the nice transition from one mode to another: the current screen smoothly zooms out, flips and then zooms back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 also features the new and improved task manager courtesy of the new FP. It has better graphics over what we saw in previous Symbian versions (think Samsung i550) and can now be accessed from every pop-up menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung claim the i8510 INNOV8 is powered by a single 330 MHz CPU with no hardware acceleration whatsoever. However, you won't know at all working with the phone as the entire UI is really responsive. You can hardly tell the difference between the INNOV8 and the Dual-CPU hardware graphic-accelerated Nokia N95 8GB in almost any scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rumor has it, the INNOV8 is actually running on a much faster CPU with HW graphics accelerator contrary to Samsung's claims. We can't comment on that, but the INNOV8 performance is commendable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things might be a little different if you run multiple heavy programs at the same time but the processing power of the INNOV8 is more than adequate for you usual everyday usage. We didn't experience any freezes or unexpected restarts either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 has 72MB of internal memory plus 8GB or 16GB of mass memory. Accessing files from the latter isn't any slower so you aren't likely to feel a difference. And running out of space to install your software is out of question. If however, by any rare chance, you happen to need more storage than the already available 8Gb or 16GB you can use the microSD card slot and expand your memory by another 16GB.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Customization options aren't too many<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Unlike most recent Nokia phones running on Symbian 9.3, Samsung i8510 INNOV8 users have a choice between only two different menu view modes. Those are the all too familiar 3 x 4 grid and list. Classic and simple, those surely are the most widely used, so we don't consider it a disadvantage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main customization option for INNOV8 users is changing the currently active theme. There are three preinstalled themes on the handset but new ones can easily be downloaded off the internet.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Can't beat the phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 surely has an impressive phonebook with massive functionality and generous storage space. Theoretically the whole internal memory is available to your contacts but filling it up is just hard to imagine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contacts can be freely ordered by first or last name and can naturally be searched by gradual typing of any of the names. You can also set whether the contacts from the SIM card, the phone memory and the service numbers will get displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact offers a great variety of preset fields and you can replicate each of them as many times as you like. You can also create new fields if you happen to be able to think of one. Personal ringtones and videos are also available for assigning. If you prefer, you may group your contacts and give each group a specific ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Call log keeps track of your recent communications. The application itself comes in two flavors - accessed by pressing the Call key on the stand-by screen or from the main menu. The first one brings 20 call records in each of its tabs for outgoing, received and missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you access the Log application from the main menu, you'll see a detailed list of all your network communications for the past 30 days. These include messages, calls and data transfers (even WLAN connections are included).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony: no issues<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We didn't experience any problems with the in-call performance of Samsung i8510 INNOV8. Reception levels are good and there were no interferences whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main disadvantage here is the missing smart-dialing feature on the Samsung i8510 INNOV8. A third party application will easily sort this but we can't imagine it was so hard for the developers to implement it in the OS itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on Samsung i8510 INNOV8. The handset performed impressively scoring an Excellent mark. Missing a call with the INNOV8 ringing volume set to the maximum is highly unlikely. And what's more, music sounds really nice through the INNOV8 stereo loudspeakers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the table comparing the i8510 INNOV8 to some of the other handsets we have tested. In case you want to find out more about the test itself or a complete list of tested devices, hit the link.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is nicely organized<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 supports all common message types - SMS, MMS and email. The first two share the all too familiar intuitive editor. It has a counter of characters left to the limit of 160. An indicator in brackets is showing the number of separate parts the message will be divided into for sending.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching from SMS to MMS is as simple as inserting some multimedia content. The phone prompts scaling down photos that are too large for sending via MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 also features a dedicated editor for instant recording of audio messages. You can either record the message on the spot or use a pre-recorder sound clip from the phone memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Delivery reports pop up on the standby screen and are then saved in a separate folder in the messaging submenu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When exiting the message editor without having sent the message, the editor prompts saving it to the Drafts folder or discarding it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email client is really nice, able to meet almost any emailing needs. Now, one thing Samsung i8510 INNOV8 lacks is the ultra easy email setup we came to know in recent Nokia phones. You have to enter every detail manually but that's basically all there is to complain about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Multiple email accounts and various security protocols are supported, so you can bet almost any mail service (be it POP or IMAP) is set to run on the INNOV8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The client can download headers only or entire messages, and can be set to automatically check mail at a given interval. A nice feature allows you to schedule sending email next time an internet connection is available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also support for attachments, signatures and generally, you can hardly think of something major that the Samsung i8510 is missing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>File manager has it all covered<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 is equipped with the typical Symbian file manager. Its functionality is practically limitless including copying, moving, creating new folders - you will hardly need something that the INNOV8 lacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What the phone misses is a Search application, as seen on Nokia sets. You'd better keep that huge storage space shipshape or you will never be able to find the files you are looking for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the ShoZu integration, all the multimedia content on the device, can be shared seamlessly to a variety of web services.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery is doing fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 has a nice picture gallery that can operate in both portrait and landscape modes, toggling between the two as easy as flipping the phone to its side. However it lacks the 3D rotating view that competing Nseries models boast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, when viewing a single photo, you can only work in landscape mode. But since this makes best use of the display anyway, we hardly consider it a disadvantage. Zooming and panning speed is hardly record-breaking but isn't too bad either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>These are 8MP photos it has to deal with after all, so we are quite happy with the INNOV8 speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery offers a nice slide show with customizable effects and delay between slides. There is also a built-in image editor that allows you to do some basic photo editing straight on your phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player does it all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Barely surprising for a multimedia powerhouse, the music player of Samsung INNOV8 does its job with ease. With the huge number of supported formats you will hardly ever come across an audio file that the phone won't handle. Album art is also supported. There are also three visualization options, so the INNOV8 has it all covered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The equalizer bars in the two optional visualizations are synced with the rhythm of the currently running track and not just randomly going up and down as we've seen elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Your music library is automatically sorted by artist, album, genre and composer and searching tracks by gradual typing is available. You can also create your own playlists in no time. The process of adding tracks to the library is as simple as choosing the refresh option. You won't need to do that if you upload the music via the proprietary Samsung PC Suite application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player comes with a massive count of equalizer presets. There are seventeen of them and new ones can be added in a matter of seconds. Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. In this case a tab appears on the standby screen indicating the currently running track.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The FM radio on Samsung i8510 INNOV8 has a neat and simple interface and can automatically scan and save the available stations in your area. It also has RDS support and is capable of FM recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, radio playback through the speakerphone is also available but you still need the headphones plugged to act as an antenna.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality is great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 went out of our audio quality test with flying colors, effortlessly scoring the pass marks on every reading and even excelling at some. We simply cannot overlook the outstanding noise level, stereo crosstalk and dynamic range readings. The total harmonic distortion is also among the best results we have ever seen a handset achieve.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The intermodulation distortion is very good too and, with a frequency response graph like that, there is very little more to ask for. The only problem we see is the low-pass filter for the lowest of frequencies but we have seen far worse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung i8510 INNOV8 frequency response graph</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the whole testing process here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8510 INNOV8 video player can work in both portrait and landscape mode and can be switched to fullscreen. When in full screen, the soft key labels are hidden so that they don't spoil the viewing and only pop up when a key is pressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone also has DivX and XviD support straight out of the box, which means you can just upload your .avi movies and enjoy. You can of course install a DivX and XviD player on any other Symbian but we are glad the INNOV8 saves us the effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And as you might have guessed, watching a movie on a screen this size is quite an enjoyable experience. It's no HTC Touch HD of course, but this is as high as non-touchscreen Symbian goes for video watching (okay, we did like the Nokia N96 kickstand but it's not such a biggie).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixel camera: just great<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 has an 8 megapixel camera on board, producing images of up to 3264 x 2448 pixel resolution. It's an autofocus unit of course and there is also LED flash on board. Unfortunately, it falls woefully short of xenon, as seen in our shootout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens is hidden under a cover that opens automatically once you turn the camera on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is extra comfortable to work with. In all fairness, the mode switch could've locked the middle position somewhat more firmly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera UI of the INNOV8 uses our favorite tab layout and offers quite an extensive range of options. However, some of the more frequently used features, such as Wide Dynamic Range (WDR), are buried deep down in the menus. On the positive side, there are handy tooltips with helpful information for the currently selected item.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Samsung i8510 you have a plethora of options to set - effects, white balance, ISO and even sharpness, saturation and contrast. Some of the cool camera features include image stabilization, geotagging and blink detection. That last one displays a warning every time someone in your frame has blinked.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 also features the wide dynamic range feature, which helps bring more detail in shadow areas by reducing the contrast. However, since Symbian handsets all have a dedicated contrast option, we were wondering what the difference would be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As it turned out, if you decrease contrast from the settings (quite illogically you should set it to +100 to do that instead of -100) the camera reveals more detail in the shadows than with WDR on. Check out these samples to see our point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All that hardware and software conveniences however are only the tip of the iceberg with the INNOV8 imaging skill. As usual, image quality is what really matters here and the INNOV8 is probably the best we've seen on a cameraphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The INNOV8 has an impressive amount of resolved detail and very good color balance. Truth be told, the colors are slightly more pumped up than the originals but this is done on purpose to make the photos look more vibrant and we happen to like it. After all, this is how most compact digicams work and there is a good reason for that. We would however perfectly understand those who prefer the more accurate colors of the LG KC910 Renoir.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image processing algorithm of the INNOV8 is really mature with no evidence of oversharpening or visible artifacts. The lens quality is exceptional, producing great edge-to-edge sharpness. We had no trouble either with exposure and focus accuracy, even difficult setups are handled easily by the INNOV8.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Macro photography is another INNOV8 strength. The phone has better depth of field than the other 8MP shooters we have tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the downsides are concerned - the INNOV8 has one major weakness. Its LED flash is utterly inadequate for shooting anything more than a meter away and there's above average noise in low-lit scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There go the Samsung i8510 INNOV8 samples we have prepared for you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For more about the INNOV8 shooting power you can revisit 

  our epic 8 megapixel shootout. There you will also find out how it compares to the latest batch of cameraphones.
</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, if imaging is your main reason for purchasing the INNOV8 you'll be more than happy with your choice. Just remember to not let the inadequate flash ruin the pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>VGA and slow motion videos: camcorders beware<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8510 INNOV8 offers excellent video recording, too. It can capture MPEG4 video at 30fps in VGA resolution, topped with two slow-motion video recording modes. Except for the D1 videos the Samsung M8800 Pixon offers, this is the best you can find on the market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual quality is more than adequate and there is no trouble with framerate either. Slow-motion videos are shot at QVGA resolution and can be either four or eight times slower than the action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can control white balance and apply the same effects as with stills. The flash can also be turned on to act as a video light. Quite naturally, you can also record sound with videos, except slow-mo of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a sample VGA video for you to check out.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Data transfers is the INNOV8 game<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is yet another of the Samsung i8510 INNOV8 elements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The INNOV8 sports USB v2.0 and Bluetooth v2.0 that includes A2DP. Wi-Fi comes with DLNA support, which allows you to share content straight from your mobile to the wireless network computers. Our only regret is there isn't a quick WLAN wizard on the homescreen like on FP2 phones by Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All kinds of network connectivity are also on board - GPRS, EDGE and 3G with HSDPA. Finally you can also use the memory card slot on the Samsung INNOV8, which combined with a suitable reader can grant you the best transfer rates.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A great browser gets even better with optical trackpad<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Symbian browser and full-ranging connectivity options make sure we're set for a nice ride browsing the internet on Samsung i8510.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset offers great page rendering and works in both portrait and landscape mode. Zoom levels are easily controlled and font size can be adjusted to fit as much content as possible on a single page. On a screen this size you can bet that is still remains readable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A mini-map can also be activated to help finding your way around large sites where lots of scrolling is required.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Symbian web browser has full Flash and Java support making all kinds of online content accessible. Watching Flash videos is not a problem, which means that you can access the desktop versions of YouTube and the likes trouble-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The virtual mouse cursor earns the browser another point. It is easy to control and generally works great. It can be controlled with the optical trackpad as in most laptops. You can scroll by pushing the mouse pointer to the page borders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-controlled virtual mouse makes web browsing much more natural and is the highest we've seen a Symbian device go.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>It is essential for a smartphone to be able to help you organize your time. Luckily Symbian developers were paying attention and gave the organizer their best effort.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 has great time-management skills and, if by some rare chance you happen to miss something, there is plenty of third party software available to take care of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar of the INNOV8 has the typical three different view modes - monthly, weekly and daily - and four types of events available for setting up - Meeting, Memo, Anniversary and To-do. Each event has unique fields of its own, and some of them allow an alarm to be activated at a preset time to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mobile office is also very well geared, with preinstalled applications able to open Word and Excel, PDF and PowerPoint files seamlessly. Unfortunately, editing documents is not supported by the included Quickoffice version. If you would like editing enabled you will have to get the paid upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other office application is ZIP manager, which allows extracting archived files straight on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Business card scanners are not something new on mobile phones, but the scanner preinstalled on the Samsung INNOV8 is among the first document scanners implemented in a handsets, and it's quite good too. We saw the same application back on the Samsung Omnia and we are still impressed by its capabilities.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The card scanning is impressively accurate and works in several languages. It also shoots automatically once it detects a business card within the frame. All the contact details can also be stored in your Phonebook should you choose so.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On board the INNOV8 there is also a nice unit converter, calculator and voice recorder, as well as the Notes application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application allows you to set up as many alarms as you want, each with its own name, trigger day and repeat pattern. If this seems too complicated, there is a quick alarm setup where all you do is set the time and you're good to go. This is quite convenient for, say, setting up your wake-up alarm.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A bunch of third-party software<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung INNOV8 comes preinstalled with several intriguing third-party applications. First of all there's the Java-based CNN News reader. It offers access to the world's hottest news through a nice graphical interface that not only looks good, but also acts fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For those of you that would like to use the big INNOV8 screen for imaging, Samsung have preinstalled the Digital Frame application - much like the one on the Samsung Omnia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides displaying a slide show of images in landscape mode, the app also offers a total of 5 different clock/date styles. You can have music playing in the background too and, if needed, event alerts such as incoming message or alarms can be suppressed when Digital Frame is running.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most attractive kind of animation is the Photo River, where the display shows a stream of photos flowing from right to left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, there's the Collins PowerDic, which is a two-way dictionary in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, and Ukrainian.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Some nice games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 comes with two nice games preinstalled. At least ours did, but you should bear in mind that this kind of stuff is strictly market dependant. The titles in question are FIFA 2008 sports simulator and the Asphalt 4 racer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And having in mind that this is a Symbian handset, you are by no means limited to those games only. There are plenty of games to download and there should be at least several that you will enjoy. So, the INNOV8 might not be a dedicated gaming handset but its ability in this area shouldn't be underestimated.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS does fine<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Samsung i8510 INNOV8 has a built-in GPS receiver of relatively good sensitivity. There are a couple of preinstalled programs that go with it but none of them offers voice-guided navigation. Once again, this is a strictly market dependant part of the preinstalled content and we guess Samsung Mobile Navigator will be available in most areas (it was available on our first test unit). You can download it additionally too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPS Data application gives you raw satellite data (coordinates, time, latitude, etc). It also allows you to setup basic navigation routes - either to an already stored Landmark or to a set of GPS coordinates. It doesn't offer a map or voice guidance but, as we said, it's pretty basic. It also integrates a Trip Meter, which has some pretty self explanatory functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well familiar Landmarks application allows you to setup various points of interest (obviously called Landmarks) by either storing your current GPS coordinates with a name, description and category or by picking a random spot on the map (provided by the Route66 Samsung Mobile Navigator app). You can also preview a previously stored Landmark on the Route66 map.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GPS+ application is the A-GPS information downloading utility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there's the Gypsii application that offers a host of location-based communication services.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you have a choice of two third-party Maps applications - Google Maps and Yahoo! Go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike Google Maps, Yahoo! Go delivers everything in one single application - web search, local news and weather information, traffic information, city guides, maps, routing and driving directions.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung i8510 INNOV8 spec sheet is spectacular. It would hardly make a big splash as the Nokia N95 back in the day but that doesn't mean the INNOV8 is any less worthy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's just that only a couple of years ago the one crowned as the top device could afford to bask in its glory at least for a while. These days the next big thing is always just around the corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still the Samsung INNOV8 stole the spotlight from the Nseries in second half of 2008 as easy as a piece of cake.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The INNOV8 may outperform its Symbian siblings over at Nokia camp by sheer specs, but these chaps can still put up a nice fight. What's simply a mobile OS to Samsung, is an entire software package complete with tailor-made enhancements to Nokia.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung should be aware they have some serious Symbian catching up to do and while they are on it, Nokia successfully provides users with a host of add-on services such as N-Gage and Ovi, and a suite of competitive applications such as Nokia Maps, Search, and the WLAN scanner just to name a few.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have successfully topped that with their INNOV8 specs going through the roof and while they keep the head start, they will reap their well-deserved benefits. In the end, the Samsung INNOV8 is as high as we've seen a non-touch Symbian go in terms of media, so why not just enjoy.</paragraph>
