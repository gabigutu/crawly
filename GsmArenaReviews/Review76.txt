			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson are on the move recently and the Aino is very much part of the agenda. But living in the shadow of the Satio and X10 is not much fun we guess. So, the Sony Ericsson Aino is keen to live a double life. At first glance, it's a touchscreen PMP, but on a second look it's a regular slider phone with an extra big screen. It's not the ultimate PlayStation phone but it does have Remote Play, to wirelessly pair with Sony's PlayStation 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as feature phones go, the Aino has pretty much everything - excellent connectivity, full-featured navigation, a great camera, plenty of internal storage and a simple-but-snappy touch media menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, don't let anyone tell you touchscreen functionality is limited to the proprietary Sony Ericsson multimedia menu. We were pleasantly surprised with Opera Mini, which seemed to quite agree with the Aino touch system. Touchscreen navigation is all there and it performed very smoothly. This means touch controlled Java games might work as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All right, this was just a single little secret revealed. Let's take a closer look at what else the Aino may be hiding there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The box contents are a sweat deal too - the matching desk stand and wireless headset would fetch a pretty high price as a separate purchase, but with Aino they are part of the experience. And the 8GB microSD card in the box should be enough for most people.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Uncomfortable questions start to emerge though - the Remote Play feature doesn't really do much more than DLNA and is useless with anything but PlayStation3. The touch functionality sounds great but not having it in the built-in browser sucks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But asking these questions is missing the point. If you owned the original PlayStation, then upgraded to PlayStation 2 and have the 3rd version sitting next to your BRAVIA set, well this love letter in the shape of Sony Ericsson Aino is addressed to you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Aino - a bag full of goodies<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Sony Ericsson Aino is one of the richest we've seen - there's a wireless Bluetooth headset with a 3.5mm audio jack, headphones to match and a desktop docking cradle included. These two are easily one of the biggest selling points of the Aino so a dedicated chapter is well in order. The prebundled 8GB microSD card is quite a treat too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest is the standard fare - a charger, a Fast Port to USB cable, and manuals. The software you need to connect the Aino to a computer is preloaded on the microSD card and you're prompted to install it when you connect the phone, so that's easy peasy.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson Aino 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Aino display is 3 inches wide and sports the somewhat peculiar WQVGA resolution of 432 x 240 pixels. We don't remember seeing such a rare pixel count since the Samsung F490, which we reviewed a long time ago.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The closed Sony Ericsson Aino instantly creates the impression of a full touch device. The smooth simplistic front and the relative slimness do make the slide-out keyboard quite unexpected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The truth however is Sony Ericsson Aino does have touchscreen capabilities but those are only limited to a few multimedia parts of the menu. Not that we haven't seen a similar approach before - the LG KF750 Secret had the same semi-touch multimedia thing going on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aino front is mainly occupied by the large 3" display and a bunch of sensors located in the vicinity (some of them are hidden in the earpiece). The screen sunlight legibility is quite good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as picture quality is concerned, the Sony Ericsson Aino performs decently but the resolution is on the low side for a 3" display. It's barely more than the typical WQVGA used in affordable touch phones with the same screen size, and Aino is set well above that category. Still, the screen has near 16:9 aspect ratio, which means movies and TV shows will make the best use of its real estate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touchscreen capabilities are centered on a new and specially designed multimedia menu, which has nicely thumb-optimized icons. It's a capacitive screen actually - nicely responsive to ensure fluid navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the slider reveals a whole bunch of keys and turns the Aino into an incredibly tall handset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dedicated Call and End knobs are crammed between the soft keys and the Activity menu and C key, but they are still large enough and easy to hit. The soft keys are slightly raised but perhaps too tiny, which makes them a little hard to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alphanumeric keypad of the Sony Ericsson Aino is using a waved layout but is somewhat rigid, much like the navigation keys above.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino has its Fast Port on the left side - it's high time Sony Ericsson drop it and moved on to more standardized ports such as microUSB. But we guess that time will come sooner or later with Sony Ericsson scheduled to implement it in 2010.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's good that the supplied wireless headset does well to at least partly address the problem.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume rocker (which also doubles as a zoom lever) and the camera button are on the opposite side. Those are both comfortable to use and do not ruin the user experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microphone pinhole and (quite surprisingly) the loudspeaker grill are at the bottom of the Sony Ericsson Aino. It's pretty strange for Sony Ericsson to claim the Aino is equipped with stereo speakers as the earpiece certainly doesn't give out any sound.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only control on top of the handset is the lock key. It only works when the handset is closed and serves to lock and unlock the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The backside is neat and simple with the 8 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash at its top left corner. The camera lens has no cover, most probably to reduce the handset's thickness, but that makes getting it scratched a pretty probable scenario.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino draws its power from a 1000 mAh Li-Po battery. The official numbers put the battery life at 300 hours of standby and eight and a half hours of talk time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the battery cover too. It's still hot-swappable though even if you have to remove the rear panel every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aino handles nicely and has a solid feel without being too heavy. The sloping edges top and bottom make it quite comfortable to hold - especially given the landscape position in which the touch media is exclusively used.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The capacitive screen is very responsive, the slider action smooth. The keypad is big enough, but the actual key press could've been better. Overall, the handset feels quite solid and durable, never mind the all-plastic build.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The white version we tested looks quite inviting. An unusual paintjob runs the risk of putting users off but this isn't the case with the Aino.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, we can't help but remember the old saying that anything new is long forgotten old. The Aino did evoke memories of the O2 Cocoon - we're not sure if it was the white finish or the docking cradle. Anyway, the Cocoon is minor league stuff compared to the Aino but it did have some style.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Desk stand and headset - a great addition<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The desk stand and the headset are great and they mean more bang for your buck (and some buck it is). Very few phones come with a wireless headset, most opt for a wired one, and desktop cradles are very rare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If we have to describe the headset in one word, that word would be "awesome". It may sound too much for a tiny tube of black and white plastic (about 6 cm in length) but this thing does nearly everything you'd need to be in charge of your music or calls. On top there's a 3.5 mm audio jack, the bottom features the charger port, which connects to the docking stand, and the power button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front of the Bluetooth headset is actually semi-translucent and reveals four multi-colored LEDs, which offer basic visual feedback. For example, a single click on the power button flashes a number of lights corresponding to the available battery charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headset is a full-featured remote control. The Call button on the front can do voice dialing, accept and reject calls (it's even enabled for call-waiting). The playback controls on the side include skip tracks (or fast-forward/ rewind upon a press-and-hold) and a play/pause button. The mic hole is just above the call button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The volume control is on the opposite side and it's touch sensitive - slide your finger towards the plus sign to turn the music up or towards the minus sign to turn it down. The LEDs automatically appear to visualize the volume bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, the headset also acts as an antenna for the FM Radio on the Aino, so no worries, you don't need to connect an extra pair of headphones just to listen to the radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now for the only gripe with the headset - whenever you have music playing, the LEDs pulse to the rhythm. We would've liked an option to turn them off. We don't quite fancy wearing Christmas decoration all the time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If the wireless headset's battery dies you can't unplug the headphones from the remote and jack them into the phone itself. Not in the Fast Port at least. And there's no 3.5mm jack as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We gotta admit that the range of this thing is exemplary - its A2DP streaming connection ran happily over a distance of more than 5 meters, which included 2-3 solid walls. Now we don't specialize in Bluetooth headsets, so take our words with a pinch of salt, but we've never seen another Bluetooth headset go as far as that one without serious sound interferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aino and its magical wireless headset didn't stay in our hands long enough for a proper battery test. We left the headset playing music at the highest volume for 2 hours and made a couple of phone calls all through the headset and its battery charge indicator went down a single notch. It may last 5 or 6 hours but we'd recommend you dock it in overnight to make sure it doesn't run out of juice right in the middle of a busy day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another wireless headset that pulls off radio stunt is the MW600 and it?s even cooler. It tops the one that comes with the Aino (model number MH100) with an LCD screen. Strangely, the list of compatible handsets includes only low end phones and the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 - the Aino isn?t listed for some reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aino desk stand is mostly covered in plastic matching that of the phone itself - that means it's black or white, depending on which color version you bought. At the bottom there's a very discreet Sony Ericsson logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the left part of the cradle, there's a Fast Port - this is where the Aino goes - and on the right is the power plug for the headset. The bottom has four rubber studs, which hold the stand in place. It can charge both the Aino and the headset at the same time and it holds the phone in landscape mode - ideal for viewing video and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, not quite. The Fast port is the only physical connection of the phone to the cradle and we gotta say it gives it quite some wobbles when you touch it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Though they felt almost like they're going to break any moment, the projecting legs of the cradle plug managed to survive operation with the docked Aino. Certainly the sensitivity of the touchscreen did help to an extent, allowing for applying little or even no pressure on the screen at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The real issue is the limited functionality of the Touch menu - it can't even start a proper slideshow so the Aino can serve as a picture frame. At least, when docked, you can use the phone as a nightstand clock</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the back of the cradle there are not one but two Fast Ports - one for charging, the other for USB connection. They are not interchangeable and can't carry sound through. A jack for external speakers would have been nice too, but we guess the wireless headset can handle that well enough.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: to touch or not to touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino is blessed with the ambiguous gift of touch. We say ambiguous, as it's definitely got the hardware to support it, but it only works in landscape mode within a limited multimedia menu (well, with the only exception of some touch-enabled Java apps). This touch menu grants access to multimedia features such as gallery, music, video and FM radio, and it's also the only means to operate the camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Leaving this brand new touch menu aside, the Aino interface is the regular Sony Ericsson feature phone UI used in most of the company's top handsets. You can only navigate around it using the D-pad on the keyboard - touch doesn't work here. The only exception is when you install a touch enabled Java application (Opera Mini in our case), which seemed to work like a charm with the Aino touch system even in portrait mode and had its own virtual QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But even without that extra touch functionality, there are a few other tweaks to set the new-wave Aino apart from the elderly C901 and W995.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is Flash-based, all the visual eye-candy implied. Let's just say that it's hard to find a better looking or more customizable feature phone interface than Sony Ericsson's - especially now that it has just been updated again. The Aino uses even more animations and 3D backgrounds than any other previous handset of the house.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standby screen is arranged in the usual manner with information on top indicating signal strength, currently used data carrier, active connections and battery status. At the bottom of the display, just above the context keys are their labels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The options for the menu layout are the standard foursome - theme-dependent, 3 x 4 grid of icons, rotating view and single icon view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rotating view features three animated front icons on the display, the center one showing the active selection. The other two icons are half-hidden, just as an indication of what comes next. Five other menu icons can be seen in the dim background.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The icon view displays a single icon at a time and a vertical bar featuring tiny pictograms for the other main menu entries. Neither of those view modes works with shortcut keys. Only the Grid view allows quick numeric keypad access.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The well-known Activity menu offers quick access to a user-defined list of favorite features, web, recent events and, of course, the Running Apps tab that takes care of multitasking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is visually appealing and snappy. Auto rotation is enabled in the Media Center and is generally quite responsive. That goes for the stock media menu, of course. The new touch media menu works in landscape only and rotation is not an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Aino supports Flash Lite themes, which change the color scheme and wallpaper. Our handset has two themes preinstalled: Clarity and Unlimited. The latter is specially designed for the Aino.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson handsets have an extra option for their wallpaper - you can use an application as background instead of an actual image. Of course you can't just use any application - the choice is limited to a few apps. In the Aino it's just one actually and near useless - the Bluetooth Robot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch-controlled parts of the interface are all media-related, so they'll be covered later in the review.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook has no changes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook has space for 1000 contacts and 7000 numbers. You can choose to view contacts in the phone memory or on SIM, but not both. Either way you can set up the phone to autosave to SIM all contacts that are being saved to the phone memory. You can also back up the entire contact list on the memory card and restore it from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact employs a tabbed interface that's been heavily used on Sony Ericsson handsets in the past couple of years. There are five tabs that group related contact details. The first tab is for names and numbers, next up is web addresses such as e-mails and URLs. The third tab is for storing a picture, a custom ringtone, group, message tone and voice command, the fourth is for postal details and - finally - the fifth has fields for a note and a birthday (which you can add to the Calendar too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The name of the contact is written in only one field, but you still have the option to order contacts by first or last name. The phone guesses which is which and it does it quite well. Naturally, you can search the contacts by gradual typing.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Wireless telephony is a nice option<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Handling of calls is excellent and we didn't experience any voice quality or reception problems with the Sony Ericsson Aino. Call clarity is great in both the earpiece and speakerphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you prefer to use the Bluetooth headset, you might have some trouble finding the right place to clip it. The microphone placement on the Bluetooth remote is not perfect and it may not always pick up your voice right. But once you discover the best position you'll have no further problems. The reception is good, you can go up to four or five meters away from the handset without signal loss. The voice quality is very good, so nothing to worry here either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Aino offers video calling, but since there is no front-facing videocall camera, it's more like video sharing - meaning that you can see the other party on your display but you can only share what your rear-facing primary camera "sees".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Smart dialing or "Smart Search" as Sony Ericsson call it, is a great boost to usability. It looks up contacts whose numbers contain the digits you have typed or whose names begin with the corresponding letters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tabbed Call Log application should be familiar too if you've used a fairly recent Sony Ericsson handset. It displays in four tabs, including All, Answered (Received), Dialed and Missed. When there are several calls made to or from a single contact, only the last one gets displayed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did our traditional speakerphone test with Sony Ericsson Aino. The maximum volume was a bit disappointing and the device scored barely made it past the good mark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Usually a Good mark in our test guarantees OK ringing volume levels. However we noticed that the music player playback volume is subjectively lower than the one from the ringer on incoming calls. So just bear that in mind if you'd like to use the Aino as a portable jukebox - it will barely cut it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how it compares to some of the other handsets we have tested. You can find information on the actual testing process, along with the full list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Perfect messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Typical of the latest Sony Ericsson phones, the Aino sports the threaded message view. SMS to and from a certain contact is organized in speech bubbles much like in an instant messenger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Switching between the conversation-style layout and the regular Inbox is only a matter of toggling a tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another interesting fact is that if you get a reply while you're still in the thread, it will be automatically added to the conversation, instead of appearing as an alert on the home screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Along with the standard messaging functionality, Sony Ericsson Aino offers the proprietary Manage Messages feature, plenty of settings for accounts and the option to assign categories to messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manage Messages application enhances message handling. Messages can be moved to memory card or phone memory, arranged by categories, date, size, and contact. Categories also allow quick and comfortable sorting of messages with separate folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a rich T9 dictionary. The SMS and MMS messages share an editor; when typing SMS you can easily convert it into an MMS via the options menu or using the attach-stuff toolbar below the text box to insert images, animations, videos or sounds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone automatically downloaded the settings for our Gmail account. The options to view messages full screen and change font size really helped get a lot of text on the screen. Even at the smallest font setting text remained legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For email you get the Manage Email feature, which has the same functionality as the one for text messages. Saving attachments is problem-free, even if the phone doesn't recognize the file type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Sony Ericsson Aino (much like all other Sony Ericsson feature phones) can't preview any documents including the ones attached to emails (such as .xls, .doc, or .pdf files for example) due to the lack of any document reader.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Touch and non-touch media don't really mix that well<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino is a media-centric slider, which doesn't differ much from high-end Sony Ericsson feature phones. But it's also a touchscreen device and gives users the extra option of handling media by touch. Keeping options open is always welcome and yes, we did think at first, that touch could be a nice bonus. Touchscreen is king on today's market but you'll never hear us say the Aino would've been better off if it was a full-touch device. But to be perfectly honest, touch could've been better implemented.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And before we start the tour, let us warn you about one of the biggest faults of the Touch Media application - the abysmal refresh rates. Every time you swap memory cards, the Aino's Touch Media will take about ten minutes to update its library. This isn't the case at all in the non-touch Media Center. And things get even uglier: without a memory card inserted it still takes 10 minutes to refresh the inbuilt memory, which isn't nearly as big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But before we get to our UI description, you may want to check our demo video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new media menu is accessible only when the keypad is closed. It consists of five icons - camera, gallery, music, video and FM radio. There is no back button in the media menu. If you want to go back in the menus, you must touch on a blank spot on the screen. It's an obvious attempt of Sony Ericsson to keep the styling of icons and menus consistent across their product range - from phones to gaming consoles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera icon throws you directly into the viewfinder. The gallery gives you access to all the images on the handset: albums are displayed by default in timeline view. Thanks to the capacitive screen, browsing thumbs is very smooth and fast. Tapping on any of the thumbs will open the selected picture full screen. Scrolling full-screen images with finger sweeps is very fluid too. Still, the touch gallery is nothing revolutionary. There's no kinetic scrolling and multi-touch support - even if it's a capacitive screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four available options in full screen view - send, edit, zoom and delete. Zooming is nicely done by a dedicated virtual zoom bar at the bottom of the screen, but it's really slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music section has one sub-menu with four buttons - Resume, Newly Added, Albums and Playlists. As you may have guessed - the last two have their own sub-menus in turn, with album icons or various playlists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video section has similar layout as the music department - the available options here are Resume, Newly Added, Videos and Camera album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The touch audio and video players look almost the same. There are three standard control buttons - previous, next and play/pause. The video player has also send and delete as additional options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the music player is running and the screen is locked an indicating red line appears at the bottom. If you touch there, the media controls will appear for a while, which is quite handy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The FM radio has new touch optimized user interface and looks very good. Frankly, it may well be the best UI among mobile FM receivers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an interesting thing to note about the FM receiver. It's embedded directly into the Bluetooth handsfree, not in the handset itself. This is quite handy, as you don't need anything plugged into the phone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good old Media Center<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Aino, just like most of its siblings, also runs the flash-based Media Center, which easily puts the basic Touch Media menu to shame. The Media Center is the launch pad to Imaging, Music, Video, Games and RSS feeds. Its settings menu is simple - you may opt for portrait, landscape or auto-rotate modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image gallery</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo gallery stores the shots you've taken, along with prebundled or uploaded images, and offers some extra options like mark as favorite and photo feed. Latest Photo provides quick access to the most recent photos. Camera Album is a thumb list for each month of the year and when a month is open, it reveals a 3 x 4 grid of photo thumbs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Scrolling down shows all the photos taken in the corresponding month with the highlighted photo slightly enlarged for better viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pictures section again opens as a 3 x 5 grid of thumbs with non-camera images such as the preinstalled wallpapers. When exiting the fullscreen view of a picture, it smoothly zooms out to thumb view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Generally, the Photo gallery is a richly-featured tool for managing your photo collection and it offers very good customization capabilities. Photo Tags displays previously marked favorite photos. The sending options include Send as Picture Msg, as Email or through Bluetooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, you can set a photo as wallpaper, screen saver, startup screen, and contact picture straight from the gallery. The well known Pan and Zoom and slideshow features are also on board.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Aino has geotagging enabled using Cell-ID - the phone has a GPS receiver too. When browsing tagged images in the gallery, the View-on-map option displays the location where the picture was taken directly on the preinstalled Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Accordingly, picture browsing via the classic file manager is still possible, but we are sure only few users will make use of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like the Sony Ericsson Yari and W995, the Aino comes with the latest Walkman player 4.0. It definitely looks the part - especially on a screen that big. You will find the new graphical styles here as well - tape recorders, gramophones, CD players - it's all part of the game of making the Walkman player more attractive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video player</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player in the media center supports fast-forwarding and rewinding, and the interface is simple and stylish. The video files are accessible via the file manager too. Other extras include fullscreen mode and subtitle support, but we can't confirm the compatible formats.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no XviD or DivX support of course, but according to Sony Ericsson, their MediaGo desktop software is enough to transfer any video from a computer to the handset in the correct format and resolution that the phone supports.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our review of the desktop application proved it does the job alright, but there's still more to wish for.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to our Aino now, the Media center video section also houses the pre-installed YouTube client. It gives you full access to clips and uploading, bookmarked favorites and so on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and TrackID<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The other FM radio app of Sony Ericsson Aino is found in the Entartainment menu and has memory for 20 stations and supports RDS. It has a nice interface and makes great use of the TrackID music recognition service. The radio can be minimized in the background much like the music player but offers none of the fancy fullscreen graphics the player does.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID is accessible through its original location in the entertainment menu. The service interface comes with the same expanded features that we first saw on C902 - "Find similar music", "Send music info via SMS", "TrackID charts" and a very extensive "Artist info" section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>TrackID also offers the online search option. It allows fast search in the entire database for artist, album, title, and lyrics.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch audio quality, but imperfect adapter<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino audio quality is near perfect with spot-on frequency response and no real weak spots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While no specific area of the Aino performance (except for the frequency response) is record-breaking they are all good enough to provide great sonic experience. There's just a tiny bit more intermodulation distortion than the best in class but nothing that the large portion of the users can hear anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only downside of the Aino audio output is the less-than-perfect wireless headset, probably limited by the Bluetooth technology. When it comes into play the stereocrosstalk basically doubles and so do the distortions. The dynamic range also gets reduced TO make the Aino's audio quality just average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In other words another handsfree (wired at that) should be a top priority of audiophiles who end up buying the Aino.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent image quality for a camera with no settings<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As you should already know by now, the Sony Ericsson Aino has a 8 megapixel camera capable of producing images with maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels. The handset is equipped with a LED flash. The camera interface relies solely on touch - this should be enough to tell you not to expect anything fancy. We just saw how basic Touch Media is compared to the full-featured Media Center.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aino has a dedicated shutter key and it can fire up the camera of course - but only when the slider is closed.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>So, the camera interface hardly had any other options than simplicity. Upon startup it displays a large icon (camera or filmstrip) to indicate the selected capture mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a simple settings toolbar at the bottom and some extra controls in the two upper corners. From the upper left corner you can change shooting mode, while on the right you'll find the exit key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings toolbar is hidden by default. It only gets activated by touching the dedicated settings icon at the bottom of the screen. The toolbar holds a few basic camera controls - scenes, focus mode, flash, self-timer, image resolution and geo-tagging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As to the rest of the settings, there are none. You can't even change the default storage setting - it is the microSD card if available or the inbuilt memory if no card is inserted. We are sure Sony Ericsson made that to simplify the touch-only interface, but a toolbar with some advanced settings would have surely been appreciated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino camera image quality is splendid. The amount of resolved detail is among the best we've seen in an 8 megapixel cameraphone and noise levels are nicely under control. The colors are absolutely pleasing and contrast is spot on to give photos quite a punch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are really pleased that Sony Ericsson upped their game, notably improving the processing algorithm over the W995. The Aino should be one of the first handsets to check out if you are looking for a capable 8 megapixel cameraphone. Just bear in mind that the image saving can sometimes be a bit too slow.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the Sony Ericsson Aino. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino is also capable of capturing video - and it's VGA@30fps we're talking about here. The LED flash is usable in the video recording. The clips are recorded in 3gp format and take about 3 MB for every minute of recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The captured videos aren't as impressive as the photos, but still meet the pass mark. The resolved detail is not as much as we hoped and there are some duplicated frames, but considering how bad is the recent LG BL40 New Chocolate, the Aino is well within reasonable lines. We suppose we can even go as far as saying it's on par with what Nokia Nseries offer. Still, the Samsung S8300 remains our favorite when it comes to regular video recording (we're not talking HD here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample video for you to check out.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Extra packed connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Aino is well versed in connectivity - all contemporary means of data transfer are supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting with the basics, there's quad-band GSM and EDGE support, as well as 3G network compatibility. The Aino has tri-band 850/900/2100 MHz support for worldwide coverage, as well as a tri-band American version at 850/1900/2100 MHz. Data speeds are quite high with 7.2Mbps HSDPA and 2Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity offers the obligatory Bluetooth 2.0 with A2DP. Aino also comes with Wi-Fi, which includes DLNA support. Oh, and there's the wired connectivity, which unfortunately makes use of only the proprietary Fast Port connector.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have recently adopted the microSD card standard making it THE standard for GSM mobile phones. The card slot on the Aino is hot-swappable, but not easily accessible - it's hidden under the battery cover. It supports cards with a capacity of up to 16GB (it comes with an 8GB card in the box), which is more free space than we've ever needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Remote Play is the thing that makes the Aino so popular. The Remote Play compatibility is limited to PlayStation 3 only - there's no support for earlier versions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once connected to the PS3, you can stream some of your PS3 media directly to the Aino. You can browse pictures, listen to music and watch videos, which are stored on your console, or download them off the PlayStation Store. Even more - you can control the PlayStation 3 Home menu with your phone, without the need of a Sony PS3 controller.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally the Media Home app uses the DLNA capabilities of the Aino to share its media with other DLNA-enabled devices such as phones, home players or TV via Wi-Fi.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser preinstalled on the Aino is the same as Yari's - an updated version of the popular NetFront 3.5 mobile browser. It offers a much smoother experience than before and renders web pages more quickly. Almost every time it nails the zoom level for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plenty of shortcuts arranged in a tree structure are listed on the homescreen, right under a search and an address bar. They grant access to free content, such as clips, tracks and games on the Sony Ericsson site, including a step-by-step guide for setting up email accounts or internet connections. The appearance of the home screen changes to a different bright color each time you start the browser too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equipped with a mouse pointer, the new NetFront 3.5 web browser always operates in fullscreen mode and the four most important features are easily accessible on a toolbar - mini-map, enter an address, favorites and downloads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Additionally, we found some other features as well such as mark-and-copy, allowing you to copy text off web pages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also automatic RSS finder. If you browse an RSS enables site, a small RSS icon will appear. If you click there you can access all the available RSS feeds.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really liked the simple web browser user interface. What we really miss though is touch support. With a capacitive screen on board the lack of touch capabilities is a shame. We'll say it again - the Opera mini was a joy to use on the touchscreen and it's just a third-party app we snatched off the web. It couldn't have been too hard for Sony Ericsson to do something about giving users better browsing options. As things are, the Aino creates a dilemma rather than a choice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing missing on the Aino is Flash support.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer and apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino offers a wide range of time-management features. The Calendar offers monthly, weekly and daily views. When you add a birth date in the phonebook, the phone prompts adding it to the calendar. The to-do application allows storing of two types of tasks: simple Tasks and Phone calls. Notes are written similar to messages and the T9 dictionary can be used here as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two eye-candy additions to the calendar app. The first one is that the main menu icon shows the actual date, just like the iPhone UI. The other is available thanks to the bigger screen - every month of the year has its own cartoon background with seasonal motives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarms are part of the main menu and there are five alarm slots available. Each one offers a lot of options - you can choose to repeat the alarm on chosen days of the week or everyday. Text and a picture can be added to the alarm. Furthermore, the alarm's behavior can be defined in case the time it is due to go off comes while the phone is in silent mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calculator is the regular Sony Ericsson app. It offers the basic functions, no bells and whistles, but you can run the Converter from there. The stopwatch and countdown timer are also the familiar basic applications. The Voice recorder has no limit to recording length, making the available free memory the only restriction.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can use the LED flash as a flashlight thanks to the Torch app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the additional applications, Sony Ericsson Aino comes with AccuWeather, Bluetooth Robot, YouTube, Music Quiz and Photo Mate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photo Mate offers help and practical tips for getting the most out of your camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Quiz is exactly what its name says - you have to name the title, artist, album or year of release of random tracks in your music library. Long story short: a part of a song is played each round and you have 5 to 30 seconds to guess.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the Bluetooth Robot is concerned, it's a very basic app that you can assign as wallpaper. It has no menus and options, its sole purpose perhaps to detect and display available Bluetooth-enabled devices in the vicinity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The AccuWeather application gives you up-to-date weather information for locations of interest. Current conditions overview and a three day forecast are available for a great number of cities around the world. You should bear in mind that the data is downloaded in real time and data charges apply. Not that we can think of any other way for the application to work but we still feel a warning is due.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You have 9 available slots, where you can assign different cities. Then you have five different weather information tabs - general, five-day forecast, two-week forecast and more.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation is perfect, but comes for a fee<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson Aino features a built-in GPS receiver. Its sensitivity is nothing spectacular - it managed to get a lock from a cold start in a couple of minutes but we had to go out into quite an open area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aino is equipped with a Wisepilot navigation software and offers all the features you'd expect in a proper SatNav solution. There's voice-guided walk and drive navigation, maps are courtesy of NAVTEQ, there's 3D view of the maps, extensive route-planning settings, speed camera alerts, POI and weather.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Its main downside is that maps are not stored locally but instead are downloaded over the air. A flat data fee is recommended but 1MB of data should get you about 600km of navigation. Still, we would have liked to have a map downloader as well, like with Nokia Maps. It really would have helped in avoiding data roaming charges.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also wish there was a built-in compass, like on most of its competitors, to facilitate navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wisepilot for Sony Ericsson comes with 30-days trial period, starting after the first time you start the app. After this month expires you will need a subscription ? 1 week license costs 3 euro, while a full year global navigation goes as high as 70 euro. The Wisepilot for LG had similar prices, but for the 70 euro you get only European navigation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can also buy separately Traffic Information and Speed Cameras as an option - for 20 euro each.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Maps is included as well if you prefer it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Two games onboard<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Aino comes with two full Java games pre-installed: Crazy Penguin Catapult and Quadrapop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Crazy Penguin Catapult is very addicting game where you hunt bears using some penguin-kamikazes. Penguins get upgraded too as you advance through the levels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Quadrapop is very similar to Tetris, this time with some colorful creatures instead of bricks.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Rethink and renew is what Sony Ericsson are quite keen to do and the Aino is among the agents of change. Perhaps it doesn't have a stronger case for innovation than the Satio and the X10, but staying in touch with history is just as important. Obviously, part of Aino's responsibility is to carry on a tradition of feature phone excellence that climaxed in the Sony Ericsson C905 and W995.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Sony Ericsson C905 ? Sony Ericsson W995 (Hikaru)</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Cybershot and Walkman are still magic words in the world of mobile phones. And Sony Ericsson continue to exploit that sort of in-house cross branding. But this time it's PlayStation making hype around the new wave of Sony Ericsson handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In all fairness though, Aino's PS3 connectivity is really making hype rather than making a mark. The Touch Media menu fails to really give it a big boost either. Good for the Aino that the standard Sony Ericsson UI is at its usual best. By the way, we cannot help the thought that some degree of touch may just not be inventive and advantageous enough. Especially against a couple of competitors that offer full touchscreens in the same form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH doesn't have as complete a feature set as the Aino - WLAN is the most prominent omission. However, its camera is little short of perfect and D1 video recording with yet unsurpassed quality makes it a must-consider if imaging is high on your priority list. Not least, it's a full touch phone and Samsung's TouchWiz simply laughs in the face of Aino's Touch Media.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH ? Sony Ericsson Aino vs. Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH size comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a body to die for and absolutely unique transparent keypad, the LG Crystal is sure to claim some of the Aino's market. S-class full-touch UI, a WVGA screen and top of the line video and still photography give the Crystal quite a punch. The mix of skill and unrivaled styling are not to be underestimated.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    LG GD900 Crystal? Sony Ericsson Aino vs. LG GD900 Crystal size comparison</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's not forget though that - among other things - the Aino is a cameraphone. The 8 megapixel shooter is complete with geotagging, touch-focus and face detection. More importantly though, it has the image quality to stand up to some worthy rivals.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Sony Ericsson C905 ? Nokia N86 8MP ? Samsung M8800 Pixon ? LG GC900 Viewty Smart</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson Aino is styled to get noticed. If nothing else - the PS3 remote play and Touch Media will add to the buzz. And Sony Ericsson do need all the hype these days - to give their new wave of gadgets a flying start.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Aino follows in the footsteps of the C905 and W995 but tries to play its own game. The complete feature list, the PMP skill and styling and the great set of accessories are tempting enough. There are things we didn't like of course. The touch thing is perhaps not the best they could do. And while the standard interface makes up for that most of the time, the limited touch control does an otherwise excellent camera no favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Aino is far from perfect as a phone. But we're tempted to look at it as a promise of what to expect of Sony Ericsson in terms of high-end non-smartphones. Whether they go for extended and polished PlayStation connectivity or full-touch feature phones - we'd be happy either way. Hope they do.</paragraph>
