			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Cookies just won?t stay put ? they need more space to do their thing. The LG KM570 Cookie Gig steps right into LG Arena territory. With looks and camera to match and a Cookie-grade price tag, this phone is on track to go platinum. The Dolby mobile logo at the back hints at a knack for multimedia and the 4GB of built-in memory means there?ll be plenty of room for your music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we?ll not let the pretty face fool us, the Cookie Gig has its highs and lows ? here they are in summary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the LG KM570 can?t quite match the LG Arena, but no mistake ? it?s a king amongst Cookies. The camera has the same high-end features as the LG Arena?s, and the inclusion of Dolby mobile and some iPod trickery earn the audio player high marks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is borrowed from the LG GD510 Pop. It?s the regular LG touch UI but with a coat of S-Class paint over it. And it works ? it?s nice to look at, ready to multitask and the homescreens are full of widgets. There?s also a bit of pointless fun with Livesquare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the LG KM570 Cookie Gig is a marked improvement over the original Cookie and the updates that came after it. But the competition wasn?t sleeping ? there are several phones that compete directly with the Gig in its price range, including even the LG Arena.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just a quick note ? the LG KM570 has quite a number of aliases. So it might be called differently where you live. The Cookie Gig is also known as LG Cookie Music, LG Surf 4GB and LG Arena II.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Never mind the name, let?s see what the Cookie Gig has to offer before we pass judgment on it. As always, we start with opening the box ? join us on the next page to see what we find.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Modest retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig comes in a compact package that carries only the essentials. There?s a charger that uses the microUSB cable to connect to the phone. A one-piece handsfree is also supplied, though it?s nothing special.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A mini CD with the needed software and some printed manuals can be found in the box, though the phone includes an animated walkthrough for basic operation, which is more than enough to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no memory card in the box, but the LG Cookie Gig comes with a 4GB of built-in memory, which is enough for a decently sized music collection.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>LG KM570 Cookie Gig 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig measures 105.9 x 52.6 x 11.9 mm ? about the same dimensions as the KM900 Arena, just a bit narrower and a hair thinner. As far as touch operated phones go, the Cookie Gig is on the compact side of things but still finds room for a 3? screen. At 87 grams, the KM570 Cookie Gig feels light as a feather in your pocket.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig takes after the LG KM900 Arena ? in fact, the front of the Gig can easily fool you. That?s a fine compliment for the young Cookie Gig ? we always appreciate premium looks within budget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of the defining features of the LG Arena was the excellent high resolution touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite being nicknamed the Arena II in certain markets, the LG KM570 Cookie Gig has the screen resolution of the original Cookie instead ? 240 x 400 pixels on a 3? screen. That?s exactly a quarter of the pixels that the Arena has on the same screen estate. The Cookie Gig?s touchscreen is a resistive unit ? the phone has a budget to meet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen has decent colors and viewing angles indoors but the blacks are not solid enough, even for a TFT. It?s quite sensitive and registers even light presses. We do miss though the sharpness that the WVGA resolution brings ? especially when reading text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sunlight legibility is sub-par. The screen layers are quite reflective and it?s hard to find an angle that doesn?t reflect sunlight, obscuring everything on the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Besides the touchscreen, the front panel of the LG Cookie Gig also features the earpiece, which doubles as the loudspeaker, the video-call camera at the top as well as the proximity sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, there are the three touch-sensitive controls: menu, call and end keys. They use the same haptic feedback as the screen and the transition is as smooth as it gets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of LG KM570 Cookie Gig features the microUSB port and the volume rocker. The microUSB port is used both for charging and data transfers with a computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right-hand side of the Cookie Gig is the shutter key. The keys are wider than their equivalents on the LG KM900 Arena and easier to use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top hosts the 3.5mm standard audio jack, the Power/Lock key and the battery cover latch. The power key is a bit too small, but comfortably raised. It?s still ok to use and accidental presses are unlikely.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no controls or connectivity ports at the bottom of the LG Cookie Gig.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back side of the LG KM570 Cookie Gig hosts the 5 megapixel camera lens with no extras ? no LED flash or lens protection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 900 mAh Li-Ion battery of the Cookie Gig is quoted at 300 hours of stand-by and 6 hours and 40 minutes of talk time. It lasted us just over two days of testing, which is about as much heavy users can expect from the Cookie Gig.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is also placed under the battery cover but it is still hot-swappable. As we managed to confirm, the LG KM570 Cookie Gig can easily handle a 16GB microSD card ? you get access to the card instantaneously, there?s no initialization period.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover has brushed metal finish but it?s made of plastic ? still, it?s pleasant to the touch and does a good job of concealing fingerprints, unlike the glossy frame on the front and of course the touchscreen itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At 11.9 mm the Cookie Gig is fairly thin, but its rounded corners slim it down even further. The glossy strip on the front and the faux brushed metal finish at the back make it quite a looker. The Blue color version that we tested looked great, but you can opt for the Prism Violet hue or the classic Silver Black variety.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Interface gets S-Classy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig is dressed up in terms of software too. It borrows the user interface from the LG GD510 Pop ? a Cookie interface at the core, with S-Class eye candy on top. It also comes with the proprietary Livesquare homescreen plus a handful of social networking apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface features a lot of nice animations and transition effects. However, it?s not the fastest we?ve seen ? every action takes a while to complete. The Cookie Gig is not unresponsive, but it can be sluggish ? it takes a second for the menu to appear, and even longer to get back to the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KM570 Cookie Gig has three homescreens but not in the usual sense of one extended desktop. It has three kinds of homescreen, though you get only one at a time and they are non-scrollable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is the Widget-enabled screen that allows you to arrange several mini applications as you please.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A touch on the marker in the bottom right corner of the homescreen pulls out the Widget tray, which holds all of the currently unused widgets. You can choose the ones you want and drag them onto the screen or stash the ones you don't need back in the tray. There?s a ?shake to auto align? feature, but you can use the padlock pictogram at the bottom left to lock the position of the widgets and prevent accidental rearrangements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The widgets available on the LG Cookie Gig include two clocks (analog and a dual time zone piece), a mini FM radio, a mini music player, a weather widget, notes app, image slideshow, a calendar, Pocket Apps, a Facebook widget and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s only one non-scrollable widget screen but the widgets have a way to deal with this ? in their default state, they are quite small but if you tap them ? they expand. For example, the calendar widget only shows the current date by default, but once you tap it, it expands to show the whole month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Pocket Apps widget is very nice and useful ? it gets you access to several installed apps. We'll get to those in detail in the mobile applications chapter of this review.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook widget shows status updates from your friends and serves as a shortcut to the full-blown Facebook application. It can be collapsed to just the Facebook icon which saves a lot of space. There are no widgets for other social networks ? you?ll have to use their respective apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, new widgets cannot be added. That is the main disadvantage compared to the competing Samsung TouchWiz interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get to the second homescreen you sweep your finger sideways across the screen. The screen turns over like you roll a cube ? a throwback to the cube menu of the original S-Class UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contact homescreen doesn't work with widgets, but lets you arrange up to eight favorite contact icons instead. You can arrange them free-hand or use the shake to auto-align feature. The screen could easily have fit one contact more but there?s no way to add more than eight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap a contact it jumps front and center and four buttons appear to the sides of the contact?s photo ? call, send an SMS, edit the contact and remove from speed dial (you can also drag it back to the dock, just as you would a widget).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there?s the Livesquare homescreen, which is in essence a log of all your recent communications. They are displayed on the screen with icons for each person you've made contact with - even ones that are not in your phonebook. By having them straight on the screen, you can easily call them back without opening the phonebook or the actual call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set the background as a Zoo, a Park or pick a custom image, populated by small human or animal figures, which will represent your contacts. You can pick from several different icons and randomize the color of their clothes for even greater variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap on a contact, the icon at the bottom of the screen starts throbbing to attract your attention ? you can call a contact, view the contact info or send them a message. You can click and drag to select multiple contacts ? but then the send message option is only available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Livesquare enhances usability but its graphical implementation is really childish. While that was OK on the tween-happy LG GW520, the LG KM570 has more mature looks, despite its Cookie branding.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaking of icons at the bottom of the screen ? there are four virtual soft keys that are there regardless of which homescreen you?re currently using. The first one takes you to the Dial pad to punch in a number, the second opens the Contact list, the third one takes you to Messaging, and the last one brings up the main menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig main menu looks very similar to the S-Class launcher (LG Arena, Viewty Smart and Crystal) and is accessible via the dedicated shortcut on the home screen. There are three menu layouts available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first is the familiar four-row layout (called ?Zigzag?) with each of the rows scrollable separately. If that?s not the thing for you, another layout puts all the icons on two pages ? in essence the four rows scroll together. The final layout arranges the icons in one tall page which you scroll up and down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you turn the phone sideways, the menu items are all displayed with smaller icons fitting the screen perfectly with no need for scrolling (but with no text labels either).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Zigzag layout, you can rearrange the icons from every row by tapping and holding the desirable icon and dragging it where you want it to appear. Strangely, that doesn?t work in the two-page layout.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen prompts you to press-and-hold but you can also slide-up to unlock. Recent events like missed calls, new messages or emails are also displayed on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cookie Gig makes use of a task manager allowing you to run several Java and native applications simultaneously and effortlessly switch between them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The task manager on the LG Cookie Gig is pretty similar to the one found on the Renoir and the Cookie. It's complemented by a secondary "Favorite apps" tab that hosts a number of configurable shortcuts to various applications. It offers up to nine slots for shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing the KM570 Cookie Gig shares with the other recent touch phones by LG is the Status screen - tapping on any of the icons on the status row on top (next to the clock) opens up a screen with signal, battery and memory stats, and allows you to quickly toggle the ringing profiles, music player and Bluetooth. It?s not quite as useful as the one on Android ? but as close as possible for a feature phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig comes with two themes for the menu ? Black and White. White is more cartoonish and goes well with the Lifesquare homescreen, but with Black you get both more serious looking menu and you get to choose the complementary color ? you can make it red on black, blue on black, or almost anything else, there?s a full palette to choose from.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The usual phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The phonebook capacity offered by the LG KM570 Cookie Gig is up to 1000 contacts, each with its full set of details. You can organize your contacts into caller groups, and you can also assign them a personal picture and a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a bunch of available fields for each contact on your list. You start off with fourteen fields, but once you enter a number or an email address, an additional empty field of the same type becomes available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also add a note to a contact and when you enter a birthday or anniversary date, you can also have the phone save it to the calendar as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also an option to choose the contact's Livesquare icon so it can't be mistaken with somebody else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you don't want to go through all the contacts to reach those starting with "Z" for example, you can either use the search box at the top or you can drag the side scrollbar. If you choose the search box option, you can have T9 turned on or off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>T9 might seem the quicker option but it has its disadvantages ? for example, it leaves room for only one contact (with T9 off, there?s room for two) and it?s not particularly good at guessing names. For example, pressing the 3 key on the keypad (you?re working with a standard 12-key pad here), types E and it doesn?t find names starting with D or F (as it should have).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can opt for displaying the SIM and phone contacts separately, as well as all together in a single list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Advanced telephony features<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig handles phone calls very well ? the voice quality is good and can be turned up really loud. The reception is mostly good, but in areas of quite poor coverage, there are some sound breakups, but we didn?t experience dropped calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer supports both smart dialing and fast dialing. When you enter the first digit, the dialer brings up the name of the contact associated with that speed dial number (if there is one). Type three digits, and if they match any part of a contact?s phone number, their name will be offered.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Cookie Gig has a proximity sensor that automatically locks and unlocks the screen. Another sensor that helps the telephony features is the accelerometer, which enables turn to mute. You can reject a call with a preset text message (and compose new reject-call messages too).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From the Common settings menu, you can activate automatic call rejection ? you can set up the Cookie Gig to reject all calls, without caller ID, contacts from specific groups and so on. This is a handy feature, similar to what Nokia Eseries have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>During a call, you can unlock the screen and take down a note, check your calendar or messages, even record a part of the conversation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The call key takes you to the call log. It's pretty standard: there are four tabs for full call history, dialed, received or missed calls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig scored a Very Good mark in our loudspeaker performance test. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging department does the job<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig handles the SMS, MMS, and email with ease. SMS and MMS share an editor, which is the normal state of affairs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For text input you get the standard virtual alphanumeric keypad with T9 in portrait mode and in landscape there?s the virtual QWERTY keyboard. Haptic feedback is enabled, which increases typing accuracy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On a 3? screen, the QWERTY keys are not very big, and the KM 570 Cookie Gig hasn?t got the most comfortable virtual QWERTY keyboard. But once you get used to it, it leaves the alphanumeric keypad in the dust in terms of typing speed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard arrangement is questionable though ? or LG thinks that people use some strange punctuation in their text messages. You get a dedicated ?!? and ?+? but no full stop, there?s both colon and semicolon ? but no comma. How about that?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Despite having a resistive screen, the LG KM570 doesn?t support handwriting recognition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie Gig has excellent support for email. Setting up an account is effortless ? you just type in your user name and password and the Gig takes care of the rest. You can even set up a Microsoft Exchange mailbox, which should please corporate users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you have to setup your email account manually, there is a host of settings that you need to enter. Both POP3 and IMAP4 protocols are supported along with SSL. The email client can be set to auto retrieve new mail at a preset interval with a dedicated setting for roaming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The maximum attachment size for both incoming and outgoing mail is 2.2MB. Such a limitation is nuisance in a modern email client and we suspect they're imposed to save network carriers the traffic hassle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Microsoft Office files and PDF files are supported and can be viewed directly from the email client or saved to the internal memory. Unsupported file types, such as ZIP or RAR, for example, cannot be opened by the phone, but still you can save those to the phone memory if you get them with an email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you've downloaded your messages, you can use the search feature to find specific emails or you can sort them by various filters such as date, sender, priority, read/unread, subject, size, etc. There is also an option for marking multiple emails as "read" or ?unread.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>File browser hides what it doesn?t understand<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig comes with 4GB of built-in memory and you can expand it up to a total of 20GB with a microSD card ? enough to carry all your music, photos and videos. The file browser has all the needed connectivity ? copying/moving/deleting files, sending over Bluetooth, both single and multiple file transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>File browsing is generally fast but when it comes to opening a folder with images, the Cookie Gig needs to refresh the thumbnails every time. Not much of a problem if you have a small picture gallery, but when photos start piling up, it could get annoying. But that's a common issue for most LG handsets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig file manager includes separate factory-preset folders for different file content. However, it has no problem handling user-created folders and the files in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One problem we spotted was that unsupported files are hidden ? you can?t copy them from one part of memory to another, you can?t attach them to emails, nothing. That?s annoying because you can save unsupported files (e.g. RAR), but you can?t, say, copy them to the memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image gallery and file browser do the same thing in different screen modes<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You can check your photos straight in the file manager or you can start the dedicated gallery. The viewer for single images is one and the same either way ? the main difference is that the file manager shows the list of photos in portrait mode only, while the gallery works exclusively in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A much better solution would have been to switch between the two automatically ? the KM570 Cookie Gig has the accelerometer for it. The Gallery app has the added ability to search photos by date using the scroller on top and you can switch to larger thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming is done only via the +/- buttons or the volume rocker, there?s no support for double-tap zooming. You can zoom in up to 6x and even for 5MP images zooming and panning are fast, though not very smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Regardless of the lack of accelerometer control while browsing the galleries, everything works just fine when viewing single images. They are rotated automatically as you turn the handset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player does an iPod trick, has Dolby mobile<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig has a feature-full music player ? it?s one of the best we?ve seen. There is nice Album Art and lots of equalizer presets ? the most important of which is the Dolby mobile mode, which noticeably improves the experience (headphones mainly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the LG Cookie Gig music player you can filter tracks as with any other modern music player: by artist, album, genre, and recently played or you can create custom playlists. There's also a track rating system, which in effect is an extra Top Rated filter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KM570 Cookie Gig player has a few more perks to offer (as if those weren?t enough). It has the iPod-like feature to automatically pause music playback when you unplug the headphones. If you want to play music on the loudspeaker, you just hit ?Play? again. However, the track doesn?t automatically resume when you plug the headphones back in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a sleep mode that will automatically shut off the player after a set period of 5 to 60 minutes and there?s even a ringtone creator ? it lets you cut out a part of a song to use as a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, the music player can run in the background. You can control the music straight on the home screen with the dedicated mini player widget. When you?re not using the widget (that is, it?s in the tray), a semitransparent strip appears near the top of the homescreen (all three of them) that shows the artist and track name. That strip just shows info, it cannot control the player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio has RDS, FM transmitter too<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig comes with an FM radio and you can enjoy it on either earphones or on the loudspeaker. In either case you've got to have the earphones plugged in as they serve as an antenna. The radio stores up to 48 stations and there is support for receiving two-line radio station info over RDS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Much like with the music player, when you minimize the FM radio you can control it using the home screen widget, however there?s no info strip like the music player if you put the widget away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the Tools section in the menu, you?ll find the FM transmitter. It creates a personal mini FM radio station ? a dead simple way to play music on your car stereo. It doesn?t require the headphones to work, which minimizes the hassle of using this option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save three channels, which are unused by local FM radio stations to quickly select a frequency that will offer minimum interference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player is good, but no DivX/XviD support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video player on the LG KM570 Cookie Gig has some pretty sweet functions ? it handled nHD videos without a hitch, it has a Dolby mobile enhancement, just like the music player, plus some extra functionality. However, it doesn?t support DivX/XviD videos and of course any video over QVGA won?t run in full resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos can run in both portrait and landscape mode. Alternating the two modes is automatic thanks to the accelerometer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A nice feature lets you take screenshots of a running video and there is also a built-in video editor that can do a number of basic modifications on the source video. You have the option too to upload a video to YouTube straight in the video player.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Pretty good audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig has nice clean audio output, fairing pretty well in our audio quality test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The fact that the handset is on the quiet side (in the headphones) takes some of the fun out but the readings are good (e.g., stereo crosstalk) to excellent (e.g, distortion levels, noise levels and dynamic range).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>That's a nice camera you have there<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig boasts a 5 megapixel auto-focus camera for a maximum image resolution of 2592x1944 pixels. It has no flash of any kind, so low-light photography is not really an option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig camera interface is the same as the one on the LG GD510 Pop. You can access all camera settings via a toolbar in the viewfinder. There you get virtual buttons for zooming, exposure, macro, resolution along with an advanced settings key. This left toolbar auto hides when not used and you need to tap on the screen to bring it back on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the right hand-side of the LG Cookie Gig viewfinder is another bar with a virtual shutter key that also slides up and down to switch between still camera and camcorder. Alongside are the exit and gallery buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, hiding the left column leaves a black strip, which is due to the aspect ratio difference between the screen and camera lens. If you don't like that you can opt for the full screen view, where a part of the image does get cropped but you see the center bit in more detail.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Going into the advanced settings, you can select shoot mode (Normal, Continuous and Panorama), add color effects, set ISO, white balance and image quality, as well as switch between cameras (front and back) and go into the More menu, for even more settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the Macro mode (which is accessible right in the viewfinder), in the advanced settings menu you can activate face detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig image quality is good but it?s not among the best 5MP shooters. Compared to the KM900 Arena, the Cookie Gig photos have less fine detail, though noise reduction still leaves enough of it in the photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Darker areas can get quite noisy and there?s noticeable fringing and over-sharpening. In poor lighting, the Cookie Gig camera can mess up the white balance, giving the photos a visible reddish tint.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic resolution<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the LG KM570 Cookie Gig. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video recording is good on paper, not so in reality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Video recording on the LG KM570 Cookie Gig has some pretty exciting specs, considering the phone?s price. The camera can capture video in D1 and VGA resolutions at 30fps and comes with slo-mo and time lapse modes as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In reality, video recording isn?t as attractive ? all videos are recorded in 3GP format, which has its limitations. Even in D1 videos @ 30fps, the rate is usually below 3Mbps. Although the video codec manages to preserve the smoothness of motion, there are so many compression artifacts that the video hardly looks it?s 720x480 pixel resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The situation with the slo-mo and time lapse modes isn?t much better ? they are both limited to QVGA resolution at low bitrates. Slo-mo videos play at 10fps and are quite compressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We can understand that shooting in slow-motion requires more processing power. Exactly the opposite is true for time-lapse though, so there?s no excuse for the videos being stuck at QVGA resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, slo-mo and time lapse videos are not good enough for YouTube, perhaps MMS mostly. D1 videos are better, but the Cookie Gig is no camcorder to write home about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here come the video samples.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig is middling in the connectivity section. It has quad-band GSM/EDGE, so you can use it with any GSM network around the world. The dual-band 3G with 7.2Mbps HSDPA kicks in for faster data transfers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course Bluetooth with A2DP and a microUSB port. When you connect the Cookie Gig to a computer and choose Mass Storage mode the internal memory and microSD card (if there?s one in the slot), appear as two different storage drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While in Mass Storage mode, phone radios are inaccessible. If you?re looking to fill up your brand new 16GB microSD card, you might want to consider using a card reader, which is still the fastest way to do bulk transfers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsing is ok<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig has a generally nice web browser, but it can become very sluggish, which spoils the overall experience. Zooming is done by double-taps or the virtual zoom keys. The double-tap zoom often failed to trigger, but the virtual keys were fairly responsive. Panning and scrolling is comparatively fast, but the Gig still needed a second to redraw the page content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose to browse with the controls visible or in Full Screen mode, which auto-hides controls after a few seconds until a tap on the screen brings them back.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the screen landscape is automatic thanks top the built-in accelerometer. You can choose between several rendering settings ? the default mode mimics how a page would be rendered on a desktop computer, another mode formats the text so that it fits better on the screen (but it?s not text reflow ? text column width stays the same regardless of zoom level) and finally you can choose text-only mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If all that is not enough, the browser can work with up to two separate tabs and it can save web pages to be viewed offline. You can also search web pages for specific text strings. The browser supports history and bookmarks too, but those are text only ? you don?t get web page thumbnails like on the LG Pop.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, desktop YouTube watching is a no-go, as the browser lacks full Flash support. You can however go for the streaming mobile version of YouTube at m.youtube.com.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The browser often seemed unresponsive ? when double-tap zooming, when clicking on a link, etc. ? but there are some differences between this and the LG GD510 Pop browser, so it might be a firmware issue.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Well set organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>LG KM570 Cookie Gig has a decent set of time-management applications. The Calendar is pretty straightforward, offering monthly, weekly and daily view modes and decently finger-optimized navigation. When you touch on a date, a pop-up appears so you can see what's under the tip of your finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose which day should be the first day of the week by default (the options are Monday or Sunday). You can also set the default view - weekly or monthly. Adding one of the three category events (appointment, anniversary, birthday) is as simple as it gets. The LG KM570 Cookie Gig can store up to 500 calendar events.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a separate To-Do application and it also has room for up to 500 tasks. A Memo feature allows storing some notes (up to 100). Another organizing app is the Date Finder, which can instantly tell you what day of the week any given date will be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, you can backup your calendar events and to-do's on the memory card and restore them later on if needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has 5 alarm slots available. Each of them can have its own title, trigger time and repeat pattern (snooze time can also be customized), as well as tone and memo. The first alarm can be controlled with the Analog Clock widget on the homescreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing applications on the Cookie Gig are a calculator (which has advanced functions too), unit converter, stopwatch, world clock and a voice recorder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig also offers office document viewing with the Picsel Document viewer. As we managed to confirm, the viewer supports DOC, XLS and PPT files, PDF files too. However, Office 2007 files (e.g. DOCX) files are not supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Zooming uses the +/- buttons as in the image gallery, and is quite fast. Scrolling and panning are another matter ? they can be choppy and unresponsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even view your documents in landscape mode ? the rotation is automatic thanks to the built-in accelerometer. In most cases reading your documents in this mode is much more comfortable and natural.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Pocket Apps are fun little tools<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG Cookie Gig comes with a suite of various applications preinstalled. First off, there's an app that lets you draw random graphics and even save your art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Banner app offers various layouts to display some text on the screen and can be used as a screensaver.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weight Tracker and Running Mate are meant to help you watch your weight and get exercise, making useful calculations such as allowed fats, BMI, speed of your runs, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Mellow Candle and Mind Selector are nothing but pastime gimmicks. Mellow Candle give you a selection of candles to blow away by physically blowing into the phone's microphone. Mind Selector on the other hand is like virtual coin flipping - you can get a simple Yes or No answer to your questions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Sound Tuner gives you a collection of ambient sounds featuring twenty different sounds - from natural to urban.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Getting social<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig has pretty good social networking support. There?s no phonebook integration but we didn?t miss it much. Not all social networks are created equal, only Facebook gets a dedicated widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Not that a Picasa widget would have been terribly useful, considering you can run the app in the background thanks to the multitasking support. But a service like Twitter is ideal for a widget ? tweets are short by nature, which makes them a perfect fit for the limited space widgets have.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The KM570 Cookie Gig comes with a Social Network menu, which lists Orkut, Facebook, Twitter, Picasa, Flickr and MySpace. However only Facebook and Twitter have apps, the rest are simply bookmarks to the respective sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook application is custom-made and nicely touch optimized. Its interface feels quite familiar, so you can get going straight away. While the widget only shows the last couple of status updates, the app can handle the rest of the functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Twitter app on the other hand is a Java app with smallish controls. It?s not the most finger-friendly app we?ve seen, but it?s a complete Twitter client. You can post tweets, read other peoples? tweets including a special section for @relpies and search is enabled as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A bunch of games<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Games section in the menu holds Games, Applications and Fun stuff. Games on the Cookie Gig are trial versions only ? BejeweledTwist, Ferrari GT Demo and The Sims 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fun stuff offers another couple of games. The first one, Flying Dice, lets you roll a pair of dice by shaking the handset. The Flying Dice also offers a set of really simple mini games, including Snakes and Ladders and a drinking game. Maybe this is the right handset to get a party off the ground.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there's the Music World game where you have to tap some jumping yellow creatures in the right moment in order to reveal some puzzle picture.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, you are free to install other games of your choice without worrying about the unconventional resolution - titles for QVGA screens run just as fine on the Cookie Gig, taking only the upper two thirds of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The unused space is occupied by virtual controls that make up for the lack of a D-pad and context keys. There are apps like Opera Mini that don't need the virtual controls as they're enabled for touch operation.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG KM570 Cookie Gig is not a phone to be impressed with; it?s a phone to enjoy. All the more so if you?re of the right age and attitude. On the hardware side, we have little complaints ? you have to keep in mind that the KM570 is a Cookie after all. The software is mostly positive too ? there are a few downfalls, but the app package is so rich you can spend days with the Cookie Gig and still find things you haven?t used yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have mixed feelings about the Lifesquare screen. Sure, it?s an interesting way to view your communication history, but to put it plainly ? it?s childish. Still, the LG Cookie Gig can do some serious work too if you get used to some of its limitations (like the email attachment size).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But let?s face it ? the LG KM570 Cookie Gig is hardly targeted at the business crowd. On the other hand, whisper ?social networking?, ?Dolby mobile? and ?good camera for photos and videos? to a youngster and you?ve sealed a deal. Not to mention the 4 gigs worth of memory and the FM transmitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>However, even a casual look at today?s market reveals trouble ahead for the young LG Cookie Gig. At its current price point, there are some competitors that might prove tough to beat.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung S5560 Marvel and the Samsung S5620 Monte have the same basic ingredients as the LG KM570 Cookie Gig, but certainly get an edge from Wi-Fi. They run the competing touch UI ? TouchWiz but cannot match the Cookie Gig?s built-in memory. For the price difference though you can easily buy a 16GB microSD card, so that?s not a problem. The Monte doesn't make it in the 5 megapixel league but has Wi-Fi and a GPS receiver to make up for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung S5560 Marvel ? Samsung S5620 Monte</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG KC910 Renoir and the Samsung M8800 Pixon used to battle it out for the 8MP cameraphone crown but today, they are equally priced alternatives to the LG KM570 Cookie Gig. They may be older in terms of hardware and software but they can match the Gig?s capabilities ? and those cameras they have there are pretty good. Much like the one on the Samsung S8300, which records the nicest WVGA video we've seen from a mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   LG KC910 Renoir ? Samsung M8800 Pixon ? Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another phone with an 8MP sharpshooter on its back is the Samsung S8300 UltraTOUCH. It too has fallen to the Cookie Gig price bracket. Its screen is smaller though (2.8?) and it doesn?t have the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally perhaps the most compelling reason against the Gig, the LG KM900 Arena, which we quite liked back in the day. It has been busy getting cheaper and can now be found for the same kind of cash as the KM570 Cookie Gig.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has four times the display resolution, a capacitive touchscreen, twice the built-in memory, Wi-Fi, GPS. There?s also DivX/XviD and TV-out and the real S-Class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG KM900 Arena</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, those are mostly older phones that we?ve looked at. And we haven?t even mentioned Corby or XpressMusic yet. Affordable touch phones are a booming market and everybody is playing hardball. The Cookie Gig will have a harder time perhaps than some of its namesakes. But it does the right thing at the right time ? bring in the updates and stay within budget.</paragraph>
