			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Desire has long been the signature of the company's tier-2 lineup. With past offerings varying from capable midrangers all the way down to entry level, going for a smartphone bearing the Desire moniker has largely been a hit-or-miss affair.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 500 is HTC's latest attempt to ride the middle road between features and price, and it is the modern day equivalent of the HTC Desire X released late last year. The other way to look at it is as the more affordable alternative of the Desire 600 dual SIM, which we reviewed a while ago. That said, the one we're dealing with is the single-SIM flavor of the HTC Desire 500, but there is a dial SIM variant, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although you won't find some of the latest bells and whistles on the Desire 500 - like an IR-port or a 1080p display - what you will get is solid quad-core performance alongside the company's latest Sense UI 5.0. Here's a quick rundown of the device's key strengths and most notable weaknesses:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 500 may not be a sports car, but the quad-core 1.2GHz processor would mean it should be a nice cruiser - and most people are after that in a midranger. The display resolution is not up there with the best on the positive side, the graphical sub-system doesn't have to draw as many pixels on the screen so this may even help with performance. Also impressive on paper are the camera capabilities, which despite not being able to handle 1080p, include 720p and slow-motion videos. As an added bonus the front-facing camera shoots in 720p as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we are never satisfied with judging phones by their specs sheets only so we'll get right into testing whether the Desire 500 is worth its salt. Up next we have a through look at the hardware and build quality.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the HTC Desire 500<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 comes in a pillbox-shaped retail package, similar to what debuted last year with the One series. Inside, you'll find a set of all-white accessories, including a compact charger with detachable microUSB cable and a single-piece headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The headset is of good quality and all the accessories have a high grade finish.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC Desire 500 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Measuring 131.8 x 66.9 x 9.9 mm, the HTC Desire 500 is just a bit shorter than the HTC Desire 600, but it is also marginally thicker. The Desire 500 weight is also almost the same at 123 grams, only 7 gram lighter than the Desire 600 Dual SIM.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Desire 500 has a very high quality finish that lends a premium feel to what is a midrange device spec-wise. This is accompanied by a solid and tight-fitting back panel that also wraps around the sides of the device. The fit is so good that most people will likely mistake it for a unibody design - which more than compensates for the slight difficulty when trying to access the card slots on the inner body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our unit came in a white paintjob with red trim that was not susceptible to fingerprint smudges. The Desire 500 also comes in black, which is the version, which is more prone to smudging.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned, the back panel wraps around the sides of the device as well, which includes covering the earpiece above the display. The red accent which circles the phone has a matte instead of glossy paintjob, and ends in opposing arrows where the volume controls are - it's a nice little touch, a subtle but elegant way to brighten things up. The camera module and HTC logo on the back have matching red accents.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Below the display you'll find a pair of capacitive buttons - back and home. Starting with the new One flagship and Sense 5.0, HTC did away with the third capacitive 'menu' key. On that device they had replaced the middle button with a non-functioning HTC logo as a placeholder, but that drew too many compulsive presses so HTC got rid of it altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display is the earpiece covered with a grille as part of the back panel. We note an important difference compared to the dual-SIM-carrying Desire 600 - there're no front-mounted stereo speakers this time around. The other things above the screen are the front-facing camera (1.6MP / 720p) along with the proximity and ambient light sensors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the HTC Desire 500 you'll find a Power/Lock key and the 3.5mm audio jack. The bottom of the phone features the primary microphone along with the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of the Desire 500 is clean of any buttons and ports, while the right side features the semi-disguised volume rocker, which is a nice design accent.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 8MP camera with LED flash is the most prominent element 'round back. The camera module is accented by matte plastic of the same red color as the frame along the sides of the device. Below it there is a large HTC logo of the same color, followed by a BeatsAudio label above a speaker grille at the bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Back to the camera, it's an 8MP unit with a BSI sensor that's 1/3.2" in size. It uses the original ImageChip found in older HTC devices, but is limited to just 720p video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping off the back cover takes some work as there's no groove or slot designed for the purpose of easily removing the panel. This isn't too much of an issue, as this isn't a dual-SIM device so you likely won't be accessing the microSD and microSIM slots underneath all that often. Below the panel you'll also find the 1800mAh battery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found that both the microSD and the microSIM cards are hot-swappable, a nifty little bonus the benefit of which is outweighed in part by the hard-to-remove back panel.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The compact 4.3" display of the HTC Desire 500 favors comfort of handling, while the finish of the plastic back and the quality materials used building the phone make it very nice to the touch. The phone's back features a slight curve just like the One, so it fits nicely in the palm of your hand. Single-handed operation is very comfortable and pocketability isn't the least bit of an issue. Overall, the Desire 500 is a delightful phone to handle and carry around.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 is built around a 4.3" capacitive touchscreen of display of WVGA resolution (800 x 480 pixels). The pixel density clocks in at around 217 ppi, which is acceptable for a midranger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there are more than a couple of 720p screens in the midrange already, but the Desire 500 has to make do with lower than HD resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Resolution aside, the Desire 500's display has great viewing angles with only minor contrast fading when viewed from an angle, and reasonably good colors, as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Indeed, colors are a tad washed out and not as saturated as the ones on the HTC One mini, for instance, but on their own, they look just fine. The white balance on the Desire 500 mini is a bit too cold (bluish) to our taste, while the contrast isn't anything to write home about either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display matrix is a standard RGB row, which we've taken a closer look at using our digital microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 display matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When it comes to sunlight legibility, the Desire 500 comes in slightly above average. While not as good as some of the premium offerings, the screen will still be visible in moderately bright environments.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Battery performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for battery life, HTC claims the Desire 500 will be good for up to 435 hours of 3G stand-by time and just over 12h hours of 3G talk. In our own battery test, the Desire 500 managed to achieve an overall endurance rating of the respectable 47 hours with 3G talk times coming in very close to the numbers provided by HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>An endurance rating of 47h means that you'll be able to go for almost two days while performing an hour each of talking, browsing and watching videos before requiring a charge. For the full battery test breakdown, check out this post.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Outdated Android 4.1.2 coupled with modern Sense 5.0 UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 runs Android 4.1.2 with Sense UI 5. It's a bit behind the curve with the more premium HTC One and One mini, which are already rocking Android 4.2.2 (with Android 4.3 just around the corner). Still, HTC has treated its mid-ranger with some of its attractive proprietary software features such as BlinkFeed. Unfortunately, the HTC Zoe has not made it and it's reserved for the bigger boys.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick showcase of the HTC Desire 500 software (and hardware) on video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Sense goes against the grain of most Android custom launchers and relies heavily on vertical scrolling, which can take some getting used to if you're coming from a different brand of a droid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is the first place you'd encounter it - it's a stream of articles from around the web delivered directly to your homescreen combined with account updates from the social network services you might be using, such as Facebook and Twitter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you tap on an item you get a preview with one big picture and a short blurb. Social networking items open the respective app instead. You can also search BlinkFeed and post updates to social networks straight from it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlinkFeed is a part of the homescreen - the leftmost pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can long press on the homescreen or do a pinch zoom out gesture to enter the homescreen edit mode. Here you can add and remove homescreen panes, rearrange existing ones and set one of them as Home (the Home buttons brings you there). The only limitation is that you can't remove or rearrange the BlinkFeed, which is always the leftmost homescreen pane.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android app drawer is the second place where HTC went with vertical scrolling instead of the more popular paged interface. The drawer displays a 3 x 4 grip of shortcuts by default (which leaves a lot of padding around icons).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Note that to access the settings in the app drawer and BlinkFeed you have to swipe down. The Desire 500 doesn't have a Menu button, but you can assign the long press action of the Home button to cover for it. If you do that, you'll give up its default purpose of opening Google Now - which will be a swipe up gesture instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the app drawer is a big clock with date and weather info (a big icon and smaller text with more details). This same clock is at the top of the BlinkFeed screen, which makes the two feel very similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shortcut dock at the bottom holds four shortcuts plus the app drawer button in the middle. These icons are always visible - in BlinkFeed, in the regular screens, in the app drawer, even on the lockscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area is pretty much stock Android - it shows only notifications by default (below the top row, which is reserved for the time and date, plus two shortcuts). There aren't any quick toggles for system settings, a feature that we very much miss. The other HTC phones running Android 4.2.2 already have that sorted out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the same goes for the widget lockscreen feature, which is present only on devices running Android 4.2.2 and up. As a result, on the Desire 500 you only get a traditional lockscreen with four non-customizable app shortcuts with the time and weather displaying above them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no way to change lockscreen shortcuts independently from the ones docked on the homescreen. Many users may find that inconvenient - LG and Samsung both let you do that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has fiddled with the app switcher - it is now launched by double tapping the Home key. It shows a 3 x 3 grid of thumbnails of the recent apps. The upside is that you don't have to scroll like you do in the regular Android app switcher, the downside is that you can't scroll at all even if you wanted to - you only get to see the last 9 apps and no more (for some that's quite enough). You can swipe up to dismiss an app (which leaves an empty slot, an older app doesn't fill its place).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an interesting option in the phone's Security settings, borrowed from the Windows Phone 8 playbook. It's called Kid mode and it is actually an app that lets you set up a profile for each of your kids, with a photo and birthdate and pick which apps they can have access to. One annoying bit is that to enable Kid mode the first time around, you need to sign up via email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 also comes with a dedicated Car mode screen, which has been styled to look like the rest of the interface. There are only five big controls besides the clock and weather info. There's music info too, which takes a whole row by itself, along with shortcuts to Navigation, Dialer, the Music player (again) and Voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sense customizations also extend to the Settings menu - HTC has prettified it a bit with custom icons and added several new options (like Media output and Personalize).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're upgrading from another phone, you should give the Setup app a spin. It hooks up to your old phone over Bluetooth and pulls all the data it can, even things that Google doesn't sync (settings and such, not just the contacts). This also works for phones that can't sync with Google, like various feature phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The settings menu isn't dramatically changed in the latest Sense. It has the same design but the app icons and toggles have been redone. Other than that, all settings are where you'd expect them to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wallpapers, lockscreen style, ringtones, notification sounds and alarms can be customized straight from here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On paper, the HTC Desire 500 boasts a quad-core CPU and 1GB of RAM, which isn't the highest amount ever put on a phone, but it is still respectable. Still, even with Sense on top, the phone ran its Android 4.1.2 operating system buttery smooth.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, the HTC Desire 500 uses the Snapdragon 200 chipset, which is Qualcomm's entry-level chipset for 2013. It's a quad-core CPU chipset and while four cores may sound impressive on paper, the real-life chipset performance is far from that. The four cores are of the Cortex-A5 variety and they all run at 1.2GHz each. The Snapdragon 200 also includes an Adreno 203 GPU alongside 1GB of RAM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has obviously kept things on a tight budget when constructing the Desire 500, so they've picked the Snapdragon 200 as the cheapest current-gen chipset. Placing a Snapdragon 400 chipset inside it, would've put it directly against the HTC One mini and that's not what HTC is after here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, let's see how the four Cortex-A5 cores perform under heavy load. Naturally, single-core performance is underwhelming, but multi-core performance isn't great either. In Linpack, the Desire 500 barely managed to float above the rock bottom of our list.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Linpack<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geekbench 2 tests just about everything you can think off. Unfortunately for the HTC Desire 500, that didn't help it bounce up from the bottom of the chart.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall performance is in a similar situation - Quadrant considers it to be above last year's midrangers, but it's still near the bottom bracket as far as the current generation of mid-range phones is concerned.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Because of the low-end Adreno 203 GPU that's running the graphics department in the Snapdragon 200 chipset, we had to reside back to the NenaMark 2 benchmark. Unlike mid- and high-end devices, the Desire 500 GPU didn't max out this test, but it leads the selected 2012 mid-rangers by as much as 11 frames.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>NenaMark 2<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it's time to move onto web performance testing. We start with the JavaScript benchmark SunSpider. Here, the HTC Desire 500 browser is close enough to that of the faster smartphones, but you have got to remember that JS doesn't care for multi-core CPU architecture much. However, BrowserMark 2 and Vellamo show scores that can't really compete with the current batch of midrangers.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While synthetic benchmarks are good for making comparison tables and all, the stuff that matters is real-life performance. In this respect the Desire 500 performed quite satisfactory most of the time - it's not as snappy as Galaxy S4 mini, for example, but it does all the daily tasks done without annoying lags or long waiting times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Now<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As an integral part of Android Jelly Bean Google Now is available on the HTC Desire 500. You can launch it by holding the home button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to being able to recognize voice commands, Google Now will learn from your usage patterns, and display relevant information. For example, if you search for a particular sports team frequently, Google Now will serve information for upcoming games you might want to watch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The service interacts with you by generating cards which are displayed on your screen and give you a short overview of information it believes is relevant to you. Going to work in the morning? Google Now knows this and lets you know there's a big traffic jam on your usual way to the office, and will offer you an alternate route. This extends to a multitude of other areas, including weather, traffic, public transit stations, and nearby points of interest.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either type or talk to Google Now and the app will give you one of its aforementioned info cards (if available) and read you its contents aloud (you can disable this in the app settings). If there's no card to help with the answer to your question, Google Now will simply initiate a Google web search instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a Google Now widget, which generates information for you based on what your interests are. You can put it on the lockscreen for at-a-glance info.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The People app in Sense 5 has seen some minor changes too. Instead of clickable tabs at the bottom of the screen you get side-scrollable tabs on the top, which is a more convenient solution (and along the lines of stock Android).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You get the dialer, all contacts, groups (including favorite contacts there), as well as a call log. Once again, you can reorder tabs and remove the ones that you don't need (Groups or Call history).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>From a drop-down menu at the top, you can filter contacts based on where they came from - the phone's address book, Facebook, Twitter or your HTC Sense account. If an account has multiple subgroups (e.g. Gmail's groups), they can be toggled individually as well by tapping the ellipsis button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Selecting a contact displays the basic details: name and photo, numbers, emails and such. That's just the first tab - the other tabs hold further details and means of communication, including email and a call log.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab holds the texts, emails and call history between you and the given contact. The next one displays social networking contact updates, and finally the "Gallery" pulls the albums that contacts have created on Flickr and Facebook. These tabs can be hidden and rearranged too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When editing a contact, you start off with just one of the essential fields but you can easily add more. If a contact is linked with a Facebook or other account you can see them either merged or choose to view either profile. In fact, the phone will automatically suggest to do that when it thinks two entries are for the same person.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A handy option is Block contact - the Desire 500 will block all calls, texts and other messages from that contact. You can add any number too, which is great if you get spam messages from an automatic number. You can later check the call and message history from those contacts and get them out of the dog house if you like.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony works like a charm<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 did great in our signal test, providing great reception. The volume in the earpiece was good as well, albeit quite loud (we almost never used it at full volume). Happily, clarity wasn't an issue.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer on the HTC Desire 500 displays your recent calls with the usual tabs above, accessible via side-swipes. There's smart dialing on the Desire 500 - once you start typing on the keyboard, contacts will be filtered by name or by phone number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can even switch to a QWERTY keyboard instead of the phone keypad. Another nice feature is the button that unveils all the contact info and lets you do just about anything - send an email, assign a custom ringtone and so on. It's a handy way to find and do something with the right contact, not just for dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only problem we have with the smart dial is that it only suggests one contact at a time - if you want another one (e.g. both Dexter and Dee Dee match "de" or "33"), you have to keep typing until you find the right one, you can't just pick out of a list of 3-4 matching contacts as on most other phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Yet another option is voice dialing, you hit the button, wait a couple of seconds for the Desire 500 to get ready and say "Call Dexter". This is a little too slow for our liking though (the phone says "Just one moment", pauses, "Say a command when you're ready" and then you can talk).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 doesn't support video calling over the cellular network by default. The good news is there are a bunch of apps which could fill in the blank spot with video calling over Wi-Fi and 3G.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset packs the standard set of accelerometer-based tricks - turning the phone in the middle of a call will enable the loudspeaker, Quiet ring on pickup will reduce the loudness of the ringtone when you move the phone and Pocket mode boosts ringtone volume if the phone is in your pocket or purse.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 500 scored a Below average mark in our Loudspeaker test. Since HTC has omitted packing the phone with the excellent BoomSound speakers, the Desire 500 results are quite far off of the regular HTC One. Still, you won't have any problems hearing the Desire 500 in mildly noisy environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging well set<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Android and the HTC Desire 500 are capable of handling all sorts of messages - SMS, MMS, email. Social networking is covered by several apps and widgets, and there's Hangouts, which can connect you to Google's chat network.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SMS and MMS messages are displayed in threads - you see a list of all conversations, each one is listed with the contact's photo, name and the subject of the last message, as well as a part of the actual message (you can choose 1, 2 or 3 preview lines). Tapping a conversation brings up the entire message history with that contact.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To add recipients, just start typing a name or number and choose from the contacts offered. The compose box covers about a fifth of the screen in portrait mode or half in landscape.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The keyboard is pretty nice. Keys are well spaced but the overlay doesn't include any gaps between them, which is only a cosmetic feature and poses no discomfort. The 4.3" diagonal offers enough space for comfortable typing. Some keys can be long pressed to get additional symbols, which speeds up typing in some cases as you don't have to keep going back to the symbols section of the keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap-and-hold on the text box gives you access to functions such as cut, copy and paste. You are free to paste the copied text across applications like email, notes, chats, etc. and vice versa. You can also enable arrow keys, which show up below the portrait keyboard (but not the landscape one).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Prediction is available, even prediction for the next word you're about to type. When the phone has learned from you, it can get pretty good at guessing and saving you whole words. You can edit a personal dictionary of words and backup and restore it either to local storage or to an email account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has included the Trace keyboard, which acts like Swipe. You drag a finger over the desired keys and the phone predicts what you're trying to write. It works really well but language support is limited. Voice transcription is also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting SMS into MMS is as simple as adding some multimedia content to the message. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text, or you can get creative with several slides and photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 comes with two email apps - the traditional Gmail app and the built-in HTC Mail app, which merges all your email accounts into a single interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gmail client has the trademark conversation style view and can manage multiple Gmail accounts. Batch operations are supported too, in case you need to handle email messages in bulk.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Mail app features conversation view in an attempt to mimic the original Gmail client threaded view, which is otherwise missing in the generic inbox. Emails in a thread are grouped and a number of emails and a down arrow appear - tap the arrow to show/hide the messages in that group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can add multiple accounts (from multiple services) and view them individually or in a combined inbox. Each account is color-coded, so you can quickly associate each message with its relevant account.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Mail app has tabs like many other Sense 5 apps. You can choose the Filters setting and show/hide the ones you want or rearrange the visible ones. You can choose from All, Favorites, Unread and Attached (hidden by default).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email sorting is enabled (in either ascending or descending order) by date, subject, sender, priority and size. The currently applied filter is displayed in the top right corner of the display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's hardly anything we can think of that the HTC One lacks in terms of email capabilities. The settings for popular email services are automatically configured. POP/IMAP accounts and Active Sync accounts are supported.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Gallery sans Zoe<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 comes with the standard for Android gallery, complete with some perks thrown in by the Sense 5 UI. Sadly, Zoe isn't one of them, as it would be an overkill for the phone's hardware. Still, you get a very sweet set of features to play with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One of those features is Events. When you get bored by the regular image gallery with photos sorted in folders, the Events groups photos by when and where they were taken. Each event has a 30 second highlight video, which is stitched together from those 3 second clips plus a slideshow, including some of the pics. You can remove clips and add new ones to the highlight video, add a video effect and also include a background music (the tracks are preset, though it is possible to add new ones to the list).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photo Editor is rich in options and even sports a Retouch section. There are also effects, frames and transformations available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As before, you can find a map with your geotagged images in the Gallery.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player with very limited codec support<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Video player on the HTC Desire 500 has a pretty simple interface. There isn't even a dedicated app, you just pick a video from the gallery. Anyway, you get a Play/Pause button and a slider to scrub through the video, a button to launch the camera and a small square with the current time and battery charge. Those automatically hide after a few seconds, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player can use the Beats audio sound enhancement just like the music player, which is great for watching videos. The video player supports DLNA and subtitles.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 failed pretty miserably when it came to codec support. It couldn't play any DivX videos, XviDs refused to play, too, and MOV files were out of the question. AC3 sound is not supported either, yet the player managed to play MKV files in up to 1080p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With a large display like that the HTC Desire 500 could really use some proper codec support to become a powerful tool for watching video on the go. Luckily, there are a few dozen video players in the Play Store to address that deficiency and some of them are even free.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player with Beats<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 comes with a custom music player, which is HTC Beats enabled, of course. The audio enhancing feature works only when on headphones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, the music player can organize your music library by Artist, Album, Songs, Playlists, Genres, Podcasts or Folders (we don't see this option very often). The phone will also easily stream songs over DLNA, you're not limited to the music library you have in the internal memory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music player has some handy features out of the box. It can automatically look for and download Album art and artist photos (you can limit it to Wi-Fi connections only).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's no equalizer on board, you just have the option to toggle Beats audio on or off. And that only works when headphones are plugged in. Luckily, the Google Play Store is chock-full with decent music player alternatives that offer an equalizer if you desperately need one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SoundHound is the track recognition of choice for HTC and it has even been integrated it into the music player UI. It easily ID's a song from just a short sample. Or you can say the name of the artist and song and SoundHound will find it for you, including lyrics. The free app however only offers a limited number of uses (99).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good old FM Radio<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There's an FM radio, which has a pretty simple interface. It automatically scans the area for the available stations and allows you to mark some of them as favorite. It also supports RDS and allows loudspeaker playback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Aside from the headphones or loudspeaker choice you also get Mono sound if the reception is poor. There's no Beats enhancement here, however, not is there a playback control card on the lockscreen. The SoundHound shortcut will find out the name of the currently playing song for you and will offer to take you to a digital music store where you can buy it or lookup the song's lyrics or watch the video on YouTube.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is loud but not the cleanest around<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 is a pretty loud smartphone, its output rivaling the best smartphones we have tested, including its HTC One stablemate. Where the entry-level handset can't quite match its premium brother is cleanness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Desire 500 had above average distortion in both parts of the test and while the rest of the readings were great, it's enough to prevent it from getting an audiophile-approved stamp.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those not as picky about distortion get to enjoy excellent stereo quality and high volume levels in addition to great dynamic range and spotless frequency response.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Standard-issue 8MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 packs an 8MP camera that does stills of up to 3264x2448 pixels in 4:3 mode and up to 3264x1840 pixels ones in 16:9 mode. It's only capable of recording 720p videos @ 30fps. There's an LED flash / video light, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a wide f/2.0 aperture and a dedicated image processing chip (HTC ImageChip). The lens has a field of view equivalent to 28mm, meaning it's wider than usual and lets you squeeze more stuff into the frame.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface, or HTC ImageSense, is the same for both the still camera and the video camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's pretty simple, as well. There are two shutter keys (one for stills and one for video), above them is the gallery shortcut and below is the effects button. On the left side of the screen you get flash mode selector and the settings shortcut button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The effects button brings out a tab on the left with the usual set of color effects (sepia, solarize and so on). There are also some other cool effects such as shallow depth of field, which lets you blur parts of a photo that fall outside a predefined circular area. It's like having Instagram built right into the stock camera app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 camera has touch focus and face detection; geotagging and smile shutter are also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuous autofocus is available too which is good to have on a phone like the Desire 500 with no hardware shutter key (the virtual shutter key cannot trigger autofocus either, it does burst mode). On the downside, the continuous autofocus may be way off in some shots - the only way to be certain you have it right is to tap and hold on the spot of the screen where you want the focus to be.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shot mode button offers some more cool stuff - HDR photos, Panorama (with a gyro horizon), portrait, group portrait, landscape, whiteboard, close-up and, finally, low light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Overall, the Desire 500 camera produces pleasantly looking images. We liked the level of resolved detail. Compared to previous HTC devices (like the Desire 600), there isn't much oversharpening going on and that's a good thing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, noise levels are fine, white balance was spot on and the colors were saturated. Also, the camera captures images relatively fast so performance was not an issue at any moment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a bunch of samples for you below, check them out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We already mentioned the Desire 500 offers a built-in HDR mode. Here's a comparison of a scene with HDR off and on. The results are a lot better than the Desire 600 for example. HTC has done a far better job than before and has improved on its HDR imaging. It's still not the best ever HDR we've seen, but it's good enough. The shadows are decently exposed and the exposure itself isn't completely off.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>720p video camera sans HDR<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 can shoot videos at up to 720p resolution at 24fps. Interestingly, an HDR option was missing when it comes to video recording.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a slow-mo video recording mode, which however is shot at a lower resolution (768x432px).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera features continuous autofocus and you have the option to lock the focus during video recording, if it hunts too much in dynamic scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are recorded in MP4 files with a bitrate of 5Mbps, which is times lower than the highest we've seen with other phones. Sound is captured in stereo with 192Kbps bitrate and 48kHz sampling rate. Framerate was constant 24fps, but sometimes would jump to 28fps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos seem okay in terms of fine detail, but they are not spectacular. What's worse, there is visible oversharpening here, unlike the still camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a 720p video sample captured with the Desire 500 we uploaded to YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download an untouched 720p sample (0:08s, 6MB) taken straight off the HTC Desire 500.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity misses a few things compared to the One<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 has the usual quad-band GSM support, plus several versions (for different regions or carriers) of 3G HSPA+. There is a dual SIM variant of the phone, which has 3G only on one of the SIM card slots. The other slot is limited to 2G GSM only - so it's basically for voice calls and messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The local wireless connectivity has Wi-Fi a/b/g/n and DLNA support (both client and server, for images, videos and music) and stereo Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC has conveniently designed a special options screen, when you connect the Desire 500 with a PC. The long list of options includes Portable Wi-Fi hotspot, settings, USB and Bluetooth tethering (the phone becomes a modem).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Portable Hotspot can support up to 8 devices, you can WEP, WPA or WPA2 encrypt the hotspot and you can enable "allowed users" only to connect or leave it open for all (unsecure, but the quickest setup).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app can be set to power off automatically after 5 or 10 minutes of inactivity, saving your battery in case you forget to switch it off when you are done with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 lacks a few connectivity options compared to the big HTC One - MHL and IR. Luckily, there's still NFC, which means you can easily send data to another phone (by a simple tap rather than the usual search and pair methods). No MHL means you can't connect the phone to a TV or attach USB storage. The IR blaster was used to control TVs and other home equipment (not to transfer data like in the old days).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Those are not necessarily deal breakers, but it's something you should know before you commit to the Desire 500.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Web browser with Flash and GIFs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC Desire 500 comes with the latest version of the Sensed-out Android web browser. Most of its UI is out of sight, leaving the entire screen to the web page. And even when it does appear it consists of a single bar, which now holds the address field, the Tabs and Menu dropdown shortcuts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once you select some text, you can copy it, do a Google search with that text as the query or share the text over a message or social networking. Pages can be reflowed to better fit the screen and you can set things like default zoom, search engine and URL suggestion providers and so on. From the Labs setting you can enable Quick controls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tabs can be closed with an X button on their top right corner - they can't be swiped off the screen like you do in the app switcher. Incognito tabs are available if you want to browse without leaving traces. There's a popup blocker to stave off annoying popups.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also request the desktop version of a site, instead of the mobile one. Another cool feature is preloading search results that the phone believes are relevant, speeding up the whole process.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 comes with full Flash support in the browser (it's disabled by default). We tested a couple of games and videos and everything worked like a charm. Flash has almost been weeded out of the mobile web, but there are still a few stubborn sites, so it's good to have as backup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interestingly, while digging through the settings menu of the browser, we found that there's an explicit setting for GIF animations, which is disabled by default. GIF on Android has a spotty history, but keep in mind the Desire 500 browser support animations, as long as you enable them first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Chrome browser also comes preinstalled on the HTC Desire 500. Its interface is easier to navigate but it doesn't offer Flash support. On the up side, it can synchronize the tabs you have open in other Chrome browsers (on a computer, tablet, other phone, you name it).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Full Office suite<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Organizing is dully covered on the HTC Desire 500. Office documents are handled through the preloaded Polaris Office app. It supports Excel, Word, PowerPoint and more and lets you view and edit files on the go. It's great to see a full Office suite when even some flagships (*cough* Galaxy S4*cough*) don't have one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tested a couple of Word and Excel files and found the One perfectly capable of handling them. There's a PDF viewer, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC even added a VPN app, KeyVPN, which you might need for your work, so it's great to have out of the box (and for free).</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar on the HTC Desire 500 has five different types of view: Month, Week, Day, Agenda and Invites. You can swipe between different months/weeks/days like you would through tabs in other Sense 5 apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a new event is quite straightforward and you can also set an alarm to serve as a reminder. Naturally, the Calendar supports multiple online calendars (including Facebook), only one of which you can sync with your computer. You can also easily show/hide the ones you don't want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. Invites view only lists events with invitation info attached to them. The day view also shows the weather forecast at the top of the screen, which is a nice touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a calculator on board. It is nicely touch optimized with big, easy to hit buttons. Flipping it horizontally enables some more advanced functions like logarithms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Clock app comes with World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch and a Timer. The World clock is like a mini Google Earth - it shows a 3D globe and you can rotate and zoom in on it freely. You can add cities that are pinned to the globe (and also visible as a list below it).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm clock application can handle multiple alarms, each with its own start and repeat time. The stopwatch and timer are pretty self-explanatory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC Tasks app is here as well. It does exactly what the name suggests and can access your Google Tasks. There is no location-based reminder support unlike with Any.DO, iOS's Reminders, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Note app is also onboard. It is somewhat similar to Samsung's SPen - you can take various notes, add drawings, pictures and dictations. Sharing and printing options are also available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC's Weather app is here too. It became popular years ago with its cool weather animations and widget. You can preset many cities across the globe and it uses the AccuWeather info (much like Samsung and Apple do).</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Play has all the apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store features several scrollable tabs - categories, featured, top paid, top free, top grossing, top new paid, top new free and trending. Apps usually have several screenshots (some even offer a demo video) so you can get an idea of what the app looks like before installing it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out comments and ratings, as well as the number of downloads and so on, to help you decide if the app is worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Google Play Store is full of all sorts of apps, but in some countries it also offers music, movies and TV shows, books and magazines.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is no HTC Hub in the Jelly Bean version of HTC's Android implementation. This means you can't get additional HTC wallpapers, HTC lockscreens, etc.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Google Maps finds your way<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC Desire 500 has a built-in GPS receiver, which managed to get a lock in under a minute. If all you need is a rough idea of where you are (within 150 meters) you can use the Cell-ID and Wi-Fi network lock, which is very fast as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google recently revamped the UI, but the basics are the same. Maps offers voice-guided navigation in certain countries and falls back to a list of instructions elsewhere. You can also plan routes for bicycles and public transport. A nice addition in the latest version is that Maps shows you a couple of alternative routes like the desktop version of Google Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For navigation, the map will cache the data it needs and will reroute you offline (so you don't need a data connection along the way). The Navigation app itself had its UI polished to match the rest of Maps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also search for nearby POI and go into the always cool Street View.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popular places around the world feature pictures and reviews by people. Street view isn't available everywhere, but it is growing in coverage and is the coolest thing we've seen on a Maps app to date (that includes Aerial view in iOS).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can save maps for offline view, which caches them on your device's storage, but keep in mind that not all map info is saved (meaning not everything down to street level like businesses, POIs, etc.).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Conclusion<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>You may not be able to tell going by the financial reports alone, but HTC has produced plenty of fine hardware in 2013. The company has consistently delivered well-built stylish smartphones with lots of character and the HTC Desire 500 is no exception.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The handset looks fresh and up-to-date, and delivers handsomely for the price. The plastic build makes the phone light and more affordable, placing it right where the company could really use a boost - the lower midrange market.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's not without some sacrifices though, that the Desire 500 is able to pull this off. The WVGA resolution stretches somewhat thin on the 4.3-inch display for one, and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 platform, while perfectly capable of handling the day-to-day workload, is having trouble when pressed harder. However, that's not a major issue - the HTC Desire 500 is the casual Android user's phone, not a benchmark-blaster.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have a specific audience in mind for the Desire 500 and seem to have hit the right price to features balance. Teenagers and young adults with little or no Android experience will likely find exactly what they're looking for in the Desire 500 and its Sense 5-skinned OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are of course plenty of alternatives, some of which may well be worth a look. The Sony Xperia L for one is a good-looking smartphone, and even a tad cheaper than the Desire 500. True, it's powered by an chipset with dual-core CPU, which however is faster than the Snapdragon 200.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Xperia L</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Over in the Windows Phone camp, the Nokia Lumia 720 will easily get some attention. Windows Phone devices have been slowly gaining ground, and the Lumia 720 is a solid blend of looks and skill. It's one of the best-looking phones in the Lumia lineup, and has the traditionally high Finnish build quality. Almost a match for price, it should be a tough call between these two if you haven't decided on the OS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Nokia Lumia 720</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG Optimus L7 II is almost the perfect match in terms of equipment, including the optional dual-SIM support. It's a bit cheaper than the Desire 500, but perhaps not as good looking.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> LG Optimus L7 II P710</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lastly, the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini will tempt users with a Super AMOLED screen of higher resolution, faster processing, a better camera and more robust battery, but these are all reflected in the price tag. A good 100 euro more is a different budget bracket altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I9190 Galaxy S4 mini</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the end, the HTC Desire 500 will likely be the obvious choice for everyone who wants their smartphone to stand out from the crowd. And it's not the typical looks vs. brains dilemma either. The Desire 500 isn't likely to impress with speed and performance, but it won't disappoint either. For anyone coming from an entry-level droid, or even a feature phone, this one's definitely worth a look.</paragraph>
