		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>From the company that's trying to have a smartphone for every pocket, taste, need and skill level - and is pretty much there in just a couple of generations - a midrange phablet should be anything but a surprise. The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra is only the second member of the Ultra lineup, trying to deliver the Xperia Z Ultra experience on a tighter budget. With hardly a manufacturer left that hasn't crossed the 6" boundary, Sony could definitely use a reinforcement to its phablet range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra, being a phablet, comes with a massive 6" IPS display of 720p resolution. A typical midranger, it is powered by the ubiquitous Snapdragon 400 chipset with four Cortex-A7 cores. In a pleasant turn of events, the Xperia T2 Ultra offers a better camera than its premium Z Ultra sibling - a 13MP Exmor RS sensor this time around, complete with a LED flash too. Nice!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, a superior camera and a LED flash are welcome on a device that's easier to handle - the Xperia Z Ultra was just shy of a tablet and these aren't exactly a photographer's first choice. Another thing that looks good about the T2, at least on paper, is the battery. Almost the exact same capacity as what the Z Ultra has, the 3,000mAh unit is powering a smaller screen this time around and of lower resolution. Sounds like better battery life - and we'll be curious to test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But that will come in due time, now let's look closer at the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra's full specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you are interested in the Xperia T2 Ultra, you are not worried about size and weight - and you are probably just in it for the screen diagonal. The T2 is a little easier to handle than the 6.4" Z Ultra but it hasn't lost the that premium feel due to the added fat around the waistline. On the outside, the device looks almost the same as the Z Ultra but the dust and water protection are gone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Getting a video player to suit your taste and needs off the Play Store has always been an option if the default app doesn't cut it, but it's a shame really to see effort wasted. Poor codec support has almost ruined the otherwise quite feature-rich Movies app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>No one is perfect though and we know better than judge a gadget by its specs sheet alone. So enough talk, let's get our hands dirty.</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Unboxing the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The retail package of the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra covers just the basics. There's an A/C adapter, a microUSB cable and the headset.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Xperia T2 Ultra 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T2 Ultra stands at 165.2x83.8x7.7mm, which is more than a centimeter shorter and nearly as much narrower than the 6.4" Xperia Z Ultra, but a millimeter thicker. With a smaller screen and lack of water protection, the T2 Ultra is 40g lighter at 172g - though probably losing the sheet of glass at the back contributes the most.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design, build quality and handling<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra may have lost the water and dust resistance, but looks no worse than its premium sibling. The OmniBalance design has been the defining feature of the entire Xperia lineup and the T2 Ultra got the same treatment - within its own budget of course. What we mean is the rear finish - no glass here, plastic instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra's entire front is naturally occupied by the massive 6" display, while the non-removable back cover is made of glossy black plastic that will get covered smudges in no time. Probably the white or purple paintjob will be less plagued by this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Fingerprints aside, the reflective black finish, the all-glass front and the familiar one-piece matte framing work well together for excellent looks, modern and stylish.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra is huge and there is no point denying that. The build quality is still top notch though, and while the slippery back may harm the handling, the matte sides offer enough grip. The T2 Ultra is a centimeter shorter and narrower than the Z Ultra, a good deal lighter and easier to operate with one hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra flaunts a 6.0" IPS Triluminos display of 720p resolution, which works out to 245ppi. While this is nowhere near the 400+ pixel density of current flagships, we should not forget that it's a completely different price range we're talking about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra display is enhanced by the Sony's Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2 and not the latest X-Reality engine. It aims to improve sharpness, reduce noise, while boosting contrast and saturation, and it does a pretty good job of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The pixel arrangement is standard RGB with an equal amount of green, red and blue pixels in a line. Below you can see it magnified using our trusty microscope.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra uses a standard RGB matrix</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contrast and brightness of the screen are very nice, color reproduction is great too, all adding up to an excellent image quality screen. The viewing angles, thanks to the IPS matrix, are very good too with little color washing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately the screen, even with turned the Auto Brightness setting off, continues to changes the brightness level according to the ambient light and the picture thus we can't do our tests at 50%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the sunlight legibility is rather mediocre. If you are using the phablet outside and it is sunny, you'll have a hard time.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sunlight contrast ratio<subsectionTitle>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra has pretty much the same controls as the Xperia Z Ultra. There's, typical of Sony, some more space than necessary above and below the 6" display. That's particularly true for the bottom, considering the main controls are on the screen itself. Above the screen, the 1.1MP front camera and the usual sensors are placed around an etched out earpiece that easily gathers dust.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This mouthpiece is the only thing of note below the screen. Just like the earpiece, it's carved out of the sheet of glass and can fill with dust over time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Xperia T2 Ultra are quite busy. The unprotected microUSB port and the microSD card slot covered by a plastic lid are on the left.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side features the 3.5mm audio jack, the sealed microSIM compartment, the signature power/lock key, plus the thin volume rocker and a camera key. A hat tip to Sony for bringing the camera control back!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, there is a pull-out tag with the regulator-mandated certifications just below the microSIM bed. This is a very clever way to have those mandatory inscriptions without engraving them into the casing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra has no controls and ports at the top and bottom.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra glossy back has the 13MP camera lens coupled with a single LED flash. The prominent speaker grille is near the bottom.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life test<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A 3000mAh battery is officially quoted at up to 24 hours of 3G talk-time or 1046 hours of 3G stand-by. Those numbers sound impressive, better than the Xperia Z Ultra's official ratings, but we are more interested in finding out how long the smartphone lasts when the screen is turned on and the quad-core chipset is not idle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra managed to output amazing battery life, much better than the Xperia Z Ultra. Note that we tested the device without using the STAMINA mode, or any battery enhancement whatsoever. The score of 96 hours means the T2 Ultra will last four days on a full charge with an hour each of calling, browsing and watching video daily.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Disclaimer: Have in mind that the excellent web browsing and video playback times scores have probably benefited from the phones's constantly active auto brightness setting even when we explicitly turned that off. We usually set the screen brightness at 50% for all phones, but there is no way of preventing the Xperia T2 Ultra from toning it down as it pleases.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a more detailed breakdown of the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra battery performance check out our blogpost.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra comes with Android 4.3 out of the box, while the company has promised the Android 4.4 KitKat update is already in the works. The software package looks very much the same whatever the Android version though and that's why everything feels and seems so familiar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, running the same software as the other Xperia phones means there are no UI optimizations to account for the big screen. The only feature that helps one-handed use is the double-tap on the Home key to slide down the notification area. Samsung and Huawei area already offering well-thought-out single-hand modes, but it seems Sony isn't keen on delivering such just yet.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There goes our usual demo video to get you started.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen is the usual affair - it supports widgets (one per pane), while the rightmost pane will fire up the camera. There are a few available default widgets, but you can always get more from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally, you can protect your lockscreen by Face, Pattern, PIN or Password unlock, in ascending order of security.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra lets you add or remove homescreen panes (you start with five) and set any of them as default. You can't have more than seven panes at any given time though, nor can you change the order they're in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding stuff on the homescreen is easy, as it is the customization. You can set various live and static wallpapers, add widgets and shortcut, or change the UI theme.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area features a few toggles (Sound, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Brightness by default). There's also a quick shortcut to the settings menu. The toggles are customizable and you can choose between 16 different quick toggles and have up to 10 of them visible in the notification area across two rows of shortcuts. You can even opt out of having the Settings key, which is nice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app drawer is laid out across multiple pages and you can sort the apps manually, alphabetically, by the most used or most recently installed. The menu with those settings is accessible via a swipe from the left edge of the screen and you can also search and even uninstall apps from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra uses the stock Android task manager that lets you switch between recently opened apps, as well as terminate them with a side-swipe.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The so-called "small apps" are also available in the T2 Ultra and are accessible via the task manager. They are similar to Samsung's Mini Apps, and pop up tiny widget-like applications on your homescreen, which you can move around and use without having to open the full-fledged app. So far, there's a default set of nine: Active Clip, Chrome Bookmarks, Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Gmail, Timer, Notes, and Voice Recorder. You can launch only one instance of a Small App, but you can open multiple Small Apps simultaneously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can download more Small Apps off the Play Store or use the option to turn your favorite widgets into Small Apps. Just hit the Plus key at the top of the list and choose a widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, Google Now integrates with your Google account and can access your daily routine, internet searches, email, etc. and give you information relevant to your interests and daily needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It provides traffic information to your work or home, knows the scores of sports teams you follow and gives you the weather forecast for your location. It's great for at-a-glance info, but can handle voice input as well. It also has a dedicated homescreen/lockscreen widget.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The user interface is buttery smooth, there is no visible lag or long loading times. The Sony launcher is lightweight and, combined with the snappy chipset, you'll get great UI experience. The upcoming Android 4.4 KitKat and its optimizations might even make things even faster.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Synthetic benchmarks<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T2 Ultra is running on the Snapdragon 400 mid-range chipset. It offers four Cortex-A7 CPU cores, Adreno 305 graphics and 1GB of RAM. We've already seen the S400 in action on the Motorola Moto G and it delivered a snappy performance. Hopefully, the light Sony UI and the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean can provide for a great performance on the T2 Ultra as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Starting off with the CPU benchmarks, the Xperia T2 Ultra posted some mid-range numbers, quite expected for this processor. The single-core performance is slightly better when compared to other Cortex-A7-powered devices such as the Moto G and Xperia C.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Benchmark Pi<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The T2 Ultra posted good results on the multi-core GeekBench 3 cross-platform benchmark. While the score pales in comparison to the latest Krait processors, the T2 Ultra does better than the Moto G and Xperia C and better than the first-gen Krait and Cortex-A9 devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Geekbench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quadrant and AnTuTu are compound benchmarks, which also take into account RAM and GPU performance. Quadrant's score is rather unimpressive, while AnTuTu's numbers are quite good, once again slightly better than the quad-core Cortex-A7-powered Moto G and Xperia C.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Quadrant<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 4<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The graphics benchmark results didn't come out that hot though. The GFXBench tests - both off-screen and on-screen variants - reflected some very poor performance.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 2.7 T-Rex (1080p off-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 2.7 T-Rex (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX Benchmark 3.0 Manhattan (on-screen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Web browsing shows the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra does OK on the JavaScript SunSpider test.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>SunSpider<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lower is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the Snapdragon 400 chipset turned out the mid-range performer we expected it to be ? nothing more and nothing less. It doesn?t really stand out from the other mid-rangers but it?s as good as most of its competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>While the T2 Ultra benchmark scores are nothing spectacular, it does great when it comes to playing games, web browsing, 1080p video playback or even multi-tasking. The UI experience is buttery smooth too and we can't complain of lag, stutter, annoying loadings or crashes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra phonebook is integrated with the dialer using a tabbed interface - the Contacts, Phone, Favorites and Groups tabs can be side-swiped. The contact list has a dedicated search filed plus it offers and an alphabetical scroll bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can sync with multiple accounts, including Exchange and Facebook, and you can selectively show or hide contacts from some accounts (as well as filter specific groups in an account), or set the phonebook to display only contacts with phone numbers or only contacts that are online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Linking contacts is available, quick contact feature is here too.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Receiving and making calls on the Xperia T2 Ultra was nothing short of pleasing. Unlike its bigger counterpart, this phone fits better in the hand, so long calls are more comfortable. It helps that it's lighter too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dialer support smart dialing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T2 Ultra scored a Good mark in our loudspeaker tests, meaning you are unlikely to miss some calls and notifications if you are in a noisy environment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony has preloaded a number of features that modify how the speaker sounds. We tested with all of them off, then with xLOUD on, but that made very little to no difference.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging and text input<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Text messages and MMS use standard thread layout. Adding multimedia (photos, videos, sounds, etc.) will convert the message automatically into an MMS.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Naturally the Gmail client and the default Email apps are onboard. Gmail can sync only with (multiple) Google accounts, while the generic Email app can handle POP and IMAP and offers a Combined inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for text input, the Xperia T2 Ultra offers a customized on-screen full QWERTY keyboard, which is very enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose a different layout (keypad, QWERTY, QWERTY with extra symbols), add/remove the coma and period button, the smiley and voice input buttons and also enable things like bilingual word suggestions if you have more than one language enabled. Different keyboard skins are available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also try the so-called Gesture input if hitting those keys individually doesn't give you the desired typing speed. It's similar to Swype, and even if you've never used a Swype-like input before you'll quickly get used to it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One-handed keyboard is available too, only in portrait orientation. If enabled it squeezes the onscreen keyboard to the left or right side of the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye-candy Albums gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra comes with the custom Sony gallery, called Album. Images are organized into groups of thumbnails and sorted by date. You can change the thumbnails size by pinching.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The gallery can connect to online albums (PlayMemories, Facebook, Picasa, Flickr) along to other devices on the local network. Maps and Globe albums are also available, which use the geotagging info to sort photos by the location at which they were taken, and faces, which groups photos by the faces of the people in them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be cropped or rotated directly in the gallery. Quick sharing via Picasa, Email apps, Facebook, Bluetooth or MMS is also enabled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a slide show using the SensMe brand and much like the music player feature, this one scans files and groups similar photos together.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Beautiful but not so powerful video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The video playing app is dubbed Movies and it too has a great custom UI. It's connected to Gracenote, which helps you find additional information about the movies and TVs you have on the phone. It will even download posters for them and for movies, it will download metadata like genre, synopsis, director and cast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, this doesn't work very well for TV shows - it doesn't recognize the S01E02 format and won't pull info about individual episodes. It gets worse, Gracenote seems to be lacking info on TV shows in general, we couldn't find even popular shows like The Big Bang Theory.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately there is more bad news - the video player does plays 1080p files hassle-free but the supported codecs are limited to Xvid, MP4 and MKV files. DTS, DD and AC3 audios are not supported, which makes the MKV compatibility pretty much obsolete. We know you can always get a proper app from the Play Store but it's a shame you can't just use the eye-candy default player for everything.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the positive side the video player supports subtitles, and you can customize their looks. Unfortunately, you cannot manually pick the subtitle file, it has to reside in the video folder to load up.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Walkman plays your music<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Walkman music player is part of the equipment of all recent Xperia smartphones. It features Music Unlimited integration and is not above trying to sell you songs, but you can hide the Music Unlimited stuff.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman interface is based on tiles that sort your music collection by Artist, Albums, Playlists, all songs and even the songs your friends are listening to (but you need to connect the player with your Facebook account).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music Unlimited stuff includes ways to discover new music - Charts, New releases and Channels. Those can be hidden individually (same goes for the artist/album/playlist tiles) or you can disable the service altogether.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Infinite button is available in the Now Playing screen (just tap the album art) - it will help you find the track's video on YouTube, look up info about the artist on Wikipedia and search for lyrics on Google. Gracenote is used here too and it can automatically download information about your tracks and album art.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Walkman player offers a variety of audio settings - ClearAudio+ option is here, which determines the best audio quality settings depending on the song you're listening to. We liked how it changed the music and carefully accentuated various details. Dynamic normalizer evens out the differences in volume between tracks, which is great if you've mixed multiple albums from multiple sources.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sound enhancements contain yet more settings. There's an equalizer with presets and manual settings (including tweaking Clear Bass). Then there's Surround sound mode, which imitates the Studio, Club or Concert Hall experience. The Clear stereo mode enhances the perceivable stereo channel separation. Dynamic normalizer minimizes the difference in volume between songs (great if you're playing a shuffled mix).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Speaker settings include Clear Phase, which adjusts the quality, while xLOUD boosts up the internal speaker.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>FM radio with RDS and social networking<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra also features an FM Radio aboard complete with RDS support. The app features multiple visualizations and integrates with TrackID to recognize the currently playing song. You can even directly send an "I'm listening to..." post to Facebook.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is clean but quiet<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra's audio output is decent for its mid-range standing. It's not the best portable player around, but its output will do just fine for the majority of users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phablet produced very clean output in the first part of our test, but it was let down by its volume levels, which were below average. Excluding that, its output has good frequency response, low noise levels, and there is no distortion whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plugging in a pair of headphones causes an average spike in the stereo crosstalk and adds some intermodulation distortion, but that's hard to detect outside lab conditions. The frequency response is slightly affected too, but again, it?s nothing major. The volume levels are once again the real disappointment here and while the dynamic range and noise level scores are still great, we can only give the Xperia T2 Ultra a satisfactory mark here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A capable 13MP camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra's camera uses one of Sony's standard-issue 13MP Exmor RS sensor. It's perhaps even the same as on the Xperia Z. It shoots with a maximum resolution of 4128 x 3096 pixels (13MP) in manual mode, or 3920 x 2204 (8.6MP) in Superior Auto. Unlike the Xperia Z Ultra, the T2 Ultra does feature a LED flash to help you with the low-light scenes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra also has a hardware shutter key. It's quite tiny and many people would probably find it uncomfortable. The good thing about it is that you can set it up to unlock the phone and start the camera. It can also snap a photo or start capturing video immediately. This might come in handy for those occasions when you want to capture something quickly.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface consists of two panes and is unified with the camcorder one - you can snap a photo or shoot a video without changing modes most of the times. Depending on the shooting mode you're in, the video shutter key may be replaced by a still/video mode toggle.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In the full resolution Manual mode you also get access to "manual controls" on the viewfinder, which sounds more impressive than it really is. There's an exposure compensation slider and a white balance selector. You can also control the ISO, metering and focus modes, turn on/off image stabilization, but those are buried in the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Superior Auto shooting mode is what we've already seen in other Xperia phones - it limits photos to 8.6MP resolution and 16:9 aspect ratio. There are no settings you can change, everything is done automatically. Unlike the 20MP Sony Xperia phones, the images taken with Superior Auto have the same quality as the one shot in Normal (Manual) mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Manual and Superior Auto aside, the Xperia T2 Ultra offers several other interesting shooting modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's Sweep panorama but, unfortunately, panoramas come out with 5MP resolution, lousy stitching and uninspiring quality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then, there are the Augmented Reality effects, which stamp one of several virtual worlds over your scene and you can even move around in this world thanks to some intriguing motion tracking effect (note that it needs visual cues to track your motion). Children will love this mode, but us bitter adults are unimpressed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other modes include the regular Picture effect mode, which creates a 3 x 3 grid that shows all the available effects in real time. Sony has also included a mode called Social streaming, which can live-stream the video feed from your camera directly on your Facebook profile. That's certainly not something you see every day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Timeshift replaces the regular burst mode, it captures 30 shots in just 2 seconds. The intriguing thing is it starts shooting even before you've pressed the shutter button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is the Background defocus - it take a photo and blurs the background. This mode shoots a few shots with different focus and then blurs everything in the background but the object in focus. Sounds like a nice thing on paper, but it fails quite often and you need to try again and again, and keep as steady as possible while shooting.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Both 13MP full resolution samples and the 8.6MP ones taken in Superior Auto have plenty of detail - the resolved amount is slightly below the latest tier of flagships, but more than enough to capture even the tiniest of details. Contrast is excellent, the colors are nice and punchy but not oversaturated, while the white balance is on spot. Finally, the noise levels are kept low and there are no image defects whatsoever.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra seems to be using the same camera module as the Sony Xperia Z. Even though, the Xperia Z has a slight upper hand in absolute detail resolving, the image processing on the Xperia T2 Ultra is much more mature. That's especially noticeable in low light shots where the noise reduction is more sparing to the fine detail and textures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are the 13MP shots we've snapped:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here are a few samples taken in Superior Auto mode. They have the same quality as the 13MP ones, but are shot in 16:9 aspect ratio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR more is a bit hard to find, but it is present on the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra. You need to go to Manual mode first, then in the Scenes Menu and then you should select Backlight Correction (HDR). The HDR mode is conservative and rescues both the highlights and shadows without making the contrast too low. Despite that we find the effect somewhat unnatural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here are a couple of HDR samples:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is another HDR scene:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video recording done in 1080p at 30 fps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra is capable of capturing 1080p video at 30fps. The camcorder shares the same UI as the still camera. You can set a timer and fiddle with settings like exposure, metering, focus mode, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For videos the T2 Ultra features a proprietary SteadyShot digital image stabilization, but there's a price to pay - the field of view (FoV) is reduced (it's how all digital stabilization systems work). The phone is smart enough to detect whether you are shooting hand-held or you have rested it on something stable but you get the reduced FoV either way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you go into video mode from the Manual shooting mode, you get an HDR option, as well as various preset scenes to pick from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also snap stills during video recording but that's not of much use as you only get 1080p images, you might as well grab a frame from the video later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra is a reasonably powerful camcorder. It captures 1080p videos at just under 30 frames per second with a good bitrate of 16-17Mbps with stereo sound recording with a bitrate of 128 Kbps and 48 kHz audio sampling rate.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The end results are good, but not perfect. The resolved detail isn't as much as we hoped for, but colors and contrast are great as on the still images. The videos are smooth with a framerate of 29-30 fps with minor variations. The continuous autofocus is much too eager and triggers too often though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a 1080p sample, which we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is an untouched 1080p@30fps video sample for you to download.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra is also capable of capturing 1080p@24fps HDR videos. The quality is the same as the standard video samples, though the videos seem choppy and the HDR effect is barely visible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also check out the HDR samples we've uploaded on YouTube as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video camera comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra captures good 1080p videos. It also manages to resolve lots of detail in the background in good light conditions, but fails to do so in the foreground. There is lots of noise in the low-light scene, though the lack of a harsh noise reduction algorithm allows for keeping more detail. You can check out how it does against the competition in good and low lighting conditions and look at the ISO chart for a synthetic estimation of the resolved detail.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Rich connectivity options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra has quad-band 2G and tri or penta-band 3G connectivity across all regional models, and support for more LTE bands than you can shake a stick at. The LTE is Cat. 4 meaning it can theoretically reach 150Mbps downlink and 50Mpbs uplink. Outside LTE coverage, the T2 Ultra is rated for mobile data speeds of up to 42 Mbps HSDPA and 5.76 Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is covered by dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with DLNA and Wi-Fi Direct, so you can easily share content from your phone on a DLNA TV or music player. If a media app supports the Throw function (like the video player), you can use it through the Smart Connect app for DLNA functions (sharing screen, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's also Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP, which can be used for low-power accessories (e.g. sports trackers). There is also support for the ultra-low power ANT+ connectivity protocol, which is usually used for connecting to various sports accessories such as heart rate monitors or bicycle speed &amp; cadence meters.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra features NFC too, but there's no app to handle the NFC functions out of the box. Luckily, there are plenty of capable NFC apps in the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MicroUSB handles the charging and PC connectivity, and there's also USB On-the-go support, so you can attach external flash drives to the smartphone as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony's Smart Connect app comes pre-installed - it allows you to set your device to do a variety of things, like launch an app or set an alarm, whenever you connect an accessory, e.g. a headset or a charger, or during a time interval (e.g. mute alarms at night). It doesn't work with NFC tags though, which is very disappointing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Google Chrome is your web browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Xperia T2 Ultra comes with Google Chrome as the default web browser out of box instead of the generic Android browser. While the minimalist interface hasn't changed since Chrome launched on Android, the browser is being constantly refined by Google, and this has resulted in one of the smoothest and most powerful browsing experiences we've encountered on a mobile.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, one of Chrome's strengths is its ability to seamlessly sync with the desktop version, using nothing but your Google account. This allows you to open an article on your PC and finish reading it on your mobile phone. It also syncs your bookmarks and favorite sites.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Chrome is generous with settings as well. You can control almost every aspect of your web browsing from choosing what content you want to allow to load like JavaScript, images, cookies and pop-ups. Reduce data usage does what it says - Google servers compress the webpage (using Google-developed tech like SPDY and WebP) and send them to the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Opening the tabs area reveals a list of tabs which can be closed, again with a left or right swipe. The animation accompanying this action is neat, too. Incognito tabs, which lets you browse without saving history or cookies, show up right next to regular tabs.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>App package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The calendar has three different types of view - daily, weekly and monthly. The lower section of the screen is reserved for a list of upcoming events. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Xperia T2 Ultra also features the Office Suite 7, which supports creating, viewing and editing office files (docs, xls, ppt), and it can also read PDFs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calculator, Clock app (with stopwatch, world clock and timer), Sketch and Notes apps are available by default.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Power Saver - now part of the settings menu - helps you extend your battery life by toggling things like Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth screen brightness, auto sync and background data on and off automatically when the battery charge falls below a certain user-defined threshold. You can also turn off the Wi-Fi if there is no saved Wi-Fi network in range or turn off mobile data when the screen is off, and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony also provides a Backup &amp; restore app, which can use the internal storage, a microSD card or even an attached USB mass storage device. You can backup the system and downloaded apps and their data along with any media files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You bet Google Maps and Navigation are also part of the app package to utilize the built-in A-GPS receiver with GLONASS support. Offline maps are available, again, since the last update, so you can save some data traffic too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whatever you may be missing, there is the always-growing Google Play Store for you.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The T2 Ultra reports to the Z Ultra in Sony's Xperia lineup - and is getting ready to take on a number of midrange phablets the competition has had for a while now. It will certainly try to position itself as a more affordable option of the Xperia Z Ultra but, at least at this point, the difference in pricing between the two doesn't quite reflect the difference in the level of equipment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra has seen a drop in screen resolution and processing power, lost the IP certification and has a more common finish than the premium Xperia Z Ultra.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What it offers in return is a more manageable size and superior imaging skills - the return of the LED flash and proper shutter key are more than welcome. The vastly improved battery life is another great plus - that was one of the the Z Ultra's most prominent shortcomings. The Snapdragon 400 chipset is par for the course and the dual-SIM option will be cheered in certain markets.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xperia T2 Ultra is running Android 4.3 Jelly Bean at launch but Sony has confirmed a KitKat upgrade is coming up. Sony usually delivers on such promises, so no reason to fear the T2 Ultra dropping out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Six-or-so-inchers are in a niche of their own but the competition isn't limited to Android. A number of 5.5" devices are viable alternatives too, so the Xperia T2 Ultra should be ready to deal with a lot of pressure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To begin with non-droids for a change, the Xperia T2 Ultra will hardly enjoy being squeezed - in terms of pricing - between a couple of Lumias. And we're taking some quite capable devices getting a real boost out of the robust 8.1 upgrade. Six inchers both of them, the Lumia 1320 and the Lumia 1520 represent a good choice of screen resolution and processing power for different budgets. Being closer, price-wise, to the 1520 will do the T2 Ultra no favors we're afraid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Nokia Lumia 1520 ? Nokia Lumia 1320</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo is the light version of the popular Note 3, sporting a 5.5" Super AMOLED 720p display and a snappy six-core processor. It has the S-Pen skills too, plus the feature-rich TouchWiz atop Android 4.3 Jelly Bean. Just like the Xperia T2 Ultra, the Note 3 Neo has a dual-SIM flavor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo ? Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo Duos</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another 5.5-incher that's otherwise a near-perfect match for the T2 Ultra is the HTC Desire 816. The recently released LTE-capable phablet is powered by Snapdragon 400 and has a 720p screen and a 13MP still camera. It comes in dual-SIM flavor too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC Desire 816</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, part of the point of having a midrange phablet is being able to respond to competitively priced options by up-and-coming makers like Huawei and Alcatel. The super affordable Huawei Ascend Mate, a 6.1" 720p display and a home-brewed K3V2 chipset, has just gotten a serious upgrade in the shape of the Ascend Mate2 4G. The latter brings LTE support and - you guessed it - Snapdragon 400 chipset, but with double the amount of RAM. The Alcatel OneTouch Hero even ups the screen resolution to 1080p, but skimps on the LTE.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>   Huawei Ascend Mate ? Huawei Ascend Mate2 4G ? Alcatel Hero</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, at least for a while, the Sony Xperia T2 Ultra will probably suffer the most at the hands of no other but its own sibling, the Xperia Z Ultra, whose asking price isn't much higher right now. Yet, this isn't a classic case of the price failing to catch up with lowered specs. When it eventually settles, enough users will appreciate the much more usable camera and nearly double the battery life, in a friendlier size.</paragraph>
