			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 is not your usual budget smartphone. The word budget is hardly a good match for an aluminum unibody, a 5" IPS display, a powerful octa-core processor, a 13MP camera, and a beefy 4,100 mAh battery. And yet, here we are. The Xiaomi Redmi 3 may be cheap in price but it does not skimp on features.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Redmi Note 3, the Redmi 3 is a massive upgrade over its predecessor - it bumps the screen size, switches from glossy plastic to metal, opts for a much more powerful Snapdragon 616 chip, upgrades the two cameras, and doubles the RAM, the storage and the battery capacity. How about the price? It stays the same - about ?150 or less.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like before, Xiaomi didn't bother to announce any details on the screen's protective glass, so we are guessing there is no special protection, probably to keep the price as low as possible. The lack of NFC isn't surprising while the non-removable battery may be a bummer for some.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3 is indeed shaping as an excellent successor to an already quite popular device. But is it as good as the sum of all these parts suggests it will be? Let's find out!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Special thanks to HonorBuy.com for providing the review unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3's retail box contains just the bare minimum - a 2A wall plug and a microUSB cable for charging and PC sync. That's it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Xiaomi Redmi 3 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3 comes with a slightly bigger display than the Redmi 2 (5.0" vs. 4.7") and thus the larger footprint. The phone spreads at 139.3 x 69.6 x 8.5 mm - that's 5mm taller, 2mm wider, but a millimeter thinner than the Redmi 2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new choice of materials, the bigger battery, and display, add some extra 11g up to 144g of weight.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and build quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new Xiaomi Redmi 3 is a departure from the previous Redmi phones and a new beginning for the series. There is a noticeable change in the familiar design with a new silver accent around the front, rounded edges and metal instead of glossy plastic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi didn't want to abandon all signature elements, though - you can notice the long loudspeaker grille at the back plus the iconic Mi logo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We got the silver edition of the Redmi 3, which employs a white front panel and a silver rear cover. The piece of metal shielding the back features a beautiful rhomboid pattern painted with dark silver dots. This isn't the type of decoration we're used to seeing on Xiaomi devices, and we appreciate the change as it gives the device some character.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two plastic strips over the back, around the top and bottom. Just like most of the smartphones made of metal, the Redmi 3 puts the antennas underneath. The good news is those are made of high-quality matte plastic, and you can easily mistake them for metal. We'd have preferred those to come decorated with the rhomboid pattern as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3, even though it ups the screen size to 5", is still a very compact phone and easily operated with just one hand. It's heavy, for better or worse, so you won't be patting your pocket often to check if it's still there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3's aluminum back provides for enough grip, better than any glossy plastic, but a notch lesser than what a matte material would have secured.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Controls<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3's control set shows nothing out of the ordinary. Above the display is the earpiece, flanked by a couple of sensors and the 5MP selfie shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the screen, we find the traditional capacitive control deck - Task switcher, Home, and Back keys. There is notification LED around, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side houses the ejectable bed, which can either take two SIM cards or one SIM and a microSD card.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side is where the volume rocker and the power/lock key are.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the Redmi 3 we find the audio jack, the second mic, and the IR blaster. On the bottom is the primary mic and the microUSB port.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 13MP camera lens is on the back, accompanied by a single LED flash. The loudspeaker grille is also around.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 features a 5" HD IPS - 0.3" bigger than the one on the Redmi 2. The resolution is the same and on the larger screen, that means a slightly lower pixel density of 294ppi. That's still borderline Retina-grade, and it is still more than enough for crisp images and sharp text.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Taking a closer look at it under our digital microscope reveals a standard RGB arrangement of the sub-pixels that make up the Xiaomi Redmi 3 LCD panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no information on the glass covering the display, and there is a good chance it isn't of the scratch-resistant kind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 has a relatively high maximum brightness of 520nits. At the lowest level, the screen is also spectacularly dim as well - 1.2nits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With an average deviation (DeltaE) of 5.2 the screen's color accuracy is about average. By sliding the screen's color temperature all the way to Warm, we were able to get out better color rendering, which we'd consider good all thing's considered. The Avg. Delta E, in this case, falls to 3.8 (remember it needs to be below 3 to be considered calibrated color output), but it comes at the expense of the maximum brightness, and it gets lower to 488nits.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Outdoors, the Xiaomi Redmi 3 is an above average performer regarding sunlight legibility. The glass on top of the display is reflective, but most of the time you'll have no problem seeing what's happening on the screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Battery life<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 has almost double the battery capacity of its predecessor - a 4,100 mAh battery is a serious battery for a 5" device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we continue with the battery life test results, we want to announce a change in our battery testing routine. Starting with the Xiaomi Redmi 3, we will be testing all devices on a fixed level of brightness of 200nits instead of merely positioning the slider at 50%.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This change has been a popular user request for quite some time now. Whereas before we would set the brightness slider midway on the phone's brightness slider, which worked out to a relatively random brightness number, we would now aim for a fixed level.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The level of 200nits, which we've chosen for our tests, has become somewhat of an industry standard. But more importantly, it's both the median and average value of the brightness levels at which we've tested all reviewed devices so far. This means our older battery life results will remain relevant and comparable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, we ran our battery test, and the Xiaomi Redmi 3 scored a 107h rating, which means you can count on the battery to last 4 and a half days if you do an hour each of calling, web browsing and video playback a day.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Such usage pattern is of course entirely artificial, but we've established it, so our battery results are comparable across devices. You can input a usage pattern of your own over at our full battery test score table, where you can also compare it to all of the smartphones we've tested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3 did well on all tests - 3G talk, web browsing, video playback, and it posted very impressive scores on standby, which makes it a great performer. The Snapdragon 616 chip seems quite energy efficient, but we should mostly thank the 4,100mAh battery for that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Our proprietary score also includes a standby battery draw test, which is not featured in our battery test scorecard but is calculated in the total endurance rating. Our battery testing procedure is described in detail in case you want to learn more about it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 supports 7 LTE bands, and you can tap to an LTE network on either SIM, but once you do, the second one will be limited to GSM connectivity only. As for that, the Redmi 3 also offers tri-band GSM connectivity. There is tri-band 3G connectivity with HSPA support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The rest of the connectivity features include single-band Wi-Fi b/g/n/ support and Wi-Fi Direct. There is also support for Bluetooth 4.1, GPS with GLONASS and Beidou, plus an FM radio.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A microUSB 2.0 port handles charging and data connections. Media transfer mode is supported for accessing the phone's built-in memory over a USB connection. The microUSB port also supports USB On-the-go for connecting USB peripherals such as pen drives, keyboards or USB hard drives.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wireless screen mirroring is available via the Miracast protocol.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The IR blaster is located on the top and coupled with the right software, it can be used to operate almost any remotely controlled home appliance, turning the Xiaomi Redmi 3 into a universal remote. Xiaomi provides its MiRemote app right out of the box.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 runs on MIUI 7, which utilizes an Android 5.1.1 Lollipop core. MIUI 7 brings its take at the interface and improves on its performance. According to Xiaomi's changelog, MIUI 7 is 30% faster and more responsive and 10% more energy efficient. It also adds a few new things as a baby album, child mode, new default themes and auto DND option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As usual, Xiaomi's customizations run very deep and replace everything including all Google services. In fact, the Mi phones sold in China don't have access to Google's services and those need to be sideloaded one way or the other (some resellers may even do that for you). The models sold officially in markets outside of China come with a preloaded Play Store app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The lockscreen has a clock in the top left corner - gone are the lockscreen widgets. To unlock the phone, you swipe upwards and if you want a quick access to the camera - just swipe from the right side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Beyond the lockscreen is the Android homescreen with four customizable shortcuts docked at the bottom by default, but you can dock up to five items. You can have any app there or even folders with multiple items if you will.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is no app drawer - anything you install pops up on your homescreen, which can have unlimited panes. There are no shortcuts, and the usual routine of removing icons (dragging them up to a recycle bin at the top of the screen) will uninstall the corresponding app. There is a pop-up for confirming the action, though, so you can't accidentally uninstall apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreen widgets are available, too - tap and hold on the homescreen, and then choose Widgets. There are few options available, but of course, you can get even more from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Homescreen effects are available, and you can change themes, too. A theme will change your homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen style, system icons, system font and the sound profile (you can disable changing the sound profile from settings).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI v.7 introduces five default themes - MIUI, High Life, Pink Blush, Rose, and Ocean Breeze, but you can always download new themes from the Mi Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The notification area has two semi-transparent tabs - the first one hosts all notifications while the second one (swipe left to access) offers (customizable) quick toggles and a Settings shortcut.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An enhanced task switcher with Clear All option is available, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By the way, Xiaomi's proprietary Search widget does a similar job as iOS's Spotlight system-wide search. You can fire it up by swiping up anywhere on the homescreen. The tool searches through your apps, music, email, settings, among others.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi provides its cloud service for content syncing between devices. Each Mi Cloud account gets 5GB of free storage. You can use it to backup contacts, messages, your entire gallery, calls log, notes, settings, voice recordings, Browser content (history, tabs, web app data) and your music library.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi's sync and backup service share lots of similarities with the Apple iCloud. There is even a free Cloud Messaging option that allows you to exchange messages with other Xiaomi owners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, if you signed in with your Mi Cloud account, you can opt for the Find device feature - a handy feature in case you misplace your Xiaomi Redmi 3 or someone steals it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI 7 has a new Child mode, which once setup, allows the limited user to run only specific apps. This is nice if you have a kid, who likes playing with your phone occasionally, and you are afraid it might delete some important data.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Do Not Disturb mode has been enhanced too - it supports better customization and scheduling options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We did get our review unit with pre-installed Google Play Store plus Google sync for app data, contacts, and browser data but perhaps they've been sideloaded by the reseller providing this review unit. Of course, you can sideload them yourself one way or the other if they don't come pre-installed on your unit. And once you have those, you can easily download all other Google apps such as Google Now straight from the Play Store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3 is Xiaomi's second smartphone to come with a locked bootloader. According to a recent official statement, the company will be locking the bootloaders of all upcoming models as required by Google's CTS (Compatibility Test Suite).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi is providing a proper tool for official unlocking of the bootloader for the users, who like to tweak their devices further. This may also require switching your official 'stable' ROM to a developer one. Note that the page is in Chinese only. It also requires you to be a member of specific status over at the Mi forum.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Performance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 is the first smartphone we meet powered by the Snapdragon 616 chipset. The new SoC offers eight Cortex-A53 cores, four of them ticking at 1.5GHz and another four running at 1.2GHz. The GPU in charge of graphics is Adreno 405 while the available RAM is 2GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 616 model isn't just a minor step from the 615 flavor, but it will undoubtedly provide more than enough power for the Redmi 3 as it is running everything on the undemanding 720p resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The multi-core performance as shown by GeekBench 3 is nothing to brag about, but it doubles the processing power of its predecessor and is on par with any other affordable octa-core Cortex-A53 CPU (the Meizu's smartphones). It also does almost the same as the S616-powered Oppo F1, which costs twice as much.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GeekBench 3<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compound AnTuTu 5 oddly outs a lesser result as in comparison with the Oppo F1, but it's still about on the average, and that's more than enough. Plus, notice the jump from the Redmi 2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>AnTuTu 5<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The compound BaseMark OS II 2.0 once again puts the Oppo F1 ahead of the Redmi 3, maybe because of the Oppo F1's 3GB of RAM. Still it does better than the Meizu's notes and not that far from the Helio X10 performance of the Redmi Note 3, which is great.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The single-core performance of a Cortex-A53 may not be much to write home about, but that's why the Redmi 3 has eight of those.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (single-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark OS 2.0 (multi-core)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Adreno 405 can perfectly handle any 720p content you throw at it, and that's noticeable in the GFX 3.0 on-screen benchmark.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p Offscreen test results, o the other hand, can show you how the chipset stacks against the competition as far as the raw GPU performance is concerned.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (onscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>GFX 3.0 Manhattan (1080p offscreen)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BaseMark X GPU test places the Redmi 3 close to other similarly priced devices.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Basemark X<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Higher is better</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi's Redmi 3 is one beautifully designed smartphone with an excellent screen and quite a powerful chipset. It may cost very cheap, but offers power you'd usually get for twice as much. Only OpenGL 3.1 compatibility is missing for rendering high-end mobile graphics, but then again we'd refer to the price - it's not a gaming phone after all.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The dialer and the phonebook share a single app although there are two shortcuts, bringing you straight to the tab you need. The app has pleasant flat looks, and it's about the same as we remember it. It uses a tabbed interface - recent with dialer on the first and the contact list on the second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 supports voice call recording, and it can do it automatically on each call if you like. You can also assign an answer gesture, pre-define quick responses upon reject, there is even support for internet calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are even more call settings if you dig deeper into the menu - flip to mute the ringer, turn on/off the proximity sensor, lock automatically once slipped in a pocket, it can even mute calls from unknown numbers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI 7 also introduces Showtime Caller ID - it's a cloud service for Xiaomi owners, and you can assign a short video recording to serve as your Caller ID when you are calling other Xiaomi owners.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 speaker scored an Average mark on our loudness test, but its sound quality was excellent with deep and crisp sound, so despite the uninspiring mark we think missed calls are unlikely in most environments.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Other apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 offers an excellent file managing app called Explorer, which lets you browse the files in its internal storage and groups them by type.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MIUI v7 also offers a Security app. It can scan your phone for malware, manage your blacklist, manage or restrict your data usage, configure battery behavior, clean some RAM; it can also manage the permissions of your installed apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The custom and now flat Calendar looks good, syncs with your accounts including Google, and offers Day and Month views.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also the standard sound recorder, notes, flashlight, calculator, clock, and weather apps, among others, that are a given in any self-respecting Android package nowadays.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We liked the Compass app. It has very nice and clean interface, shows the magnetic directions and doubles as a level meter. If you lift the phone up, then you'll get a nice augmented reality view with real-time East/West/North/South overlay.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, if Google Maps, Drive, or any other Google-related app isn't installed on your unit, you can get it for free from the Play Store.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The gallery<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 comes with a custom Gallery app, slightly updated since the MIUI 6. It defaults to your camera roll, but it also supports Albums, Cloud, and People. The People sorting, once chosen, sorts all of your photos by people's faces. Everything is automatic. Here you can also create a new baby album, to put your newborn pics inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The integrated editor offers various effects, frames, tools (crop, mirror, straighten, rotate, fisheye, doodle) plus light adjustments that let you bring out the shadows or the highlights.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The MIUI music player is a custom app with a well laid out, easy to navigate interface. It features two tabs - the first one is cloud music, similar to Google Music service provided by Xiaomi while the second tab has your own local and cloud music.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player has cool effects, transitions, and transparent elements, especially on the expandable Now Playing section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 offers customizable equalizers within the phone's Settings menu - there are a few default presets already available for use. You can also try Xiaomi's MiSound enhancer, which comes into play when you use headphones, and especially, a Xiaomi-branded headset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>An FM radio app is also available. The Redmi 3 requires a headset to use as an antenna. FM recording is also available.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 features a separate video app, which offers a paid video service. Whether you will open your files from the Video app (Local setting) or File Explorer - it doesn't matter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video player interface is very basic, subtitles and pop-up play are not supported.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is mostly good<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 didn?t quite manage to impress us with loudness (it was only average), but its output with an active external amplifier was clean. With no weak points to its performance, it will do an excellent job of powering your home or car stereo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plug in a pair of headphones and stereo crosstalk skyrockets, but other readings remain stellar. It?s not a perfect showing, but it?s more than you can expect at this price point.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can learn more about the tested parameters and the whole testing process here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A 13MP snapper with an LED flash<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 features a 13MP camera, just like the Redmi Note 3. It is equipped with a standard single LED flash. The snapper also features a hybrid autofocus system utilizing phase-detection for faster and more accurate focus.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface is fairly simple and features toggles for the HDR mode, the flash and the video camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has three panes - the default one shows the viewfinder with a virtual shutter, flash trigger and front camera key. A pull down from the top of the screen gets you a choice of 12 filters with live previews. A slide from the bottom displays the advanced modes such as Panorama, Beautify, Scenes, and Manual as well as the camera settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Manual Mode offers you manual settings for white balance and ISO. The Face Detection switch is within the additional settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We found the Xiaomi Redmi 3 to perform very well regarding image quality. It snaps the photos very quickly, resolves above average amount of detail, and while there is some corner softness, the noise levels are kept reasonably low. The white balance is accurate, and we like the lively color rendition. The dynamic range turned out average, but sometimes it managed to surprise us by capturing a lot of detail in the shadows without turning the HDR mode on.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like other non-flagship Xiaomi phones, the Redmi 3's samples are nothing spectacular, but they look excellent on the 5" display and work great for capturing and sharing your moments on social networks. The Redmi 3 ticks the right boxes in most of the scenarios - the colors and contrast are good, there is enough detail, the dynamic range is good for the class as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HDR mode is conservative enough and rescues both the highlights and shadows without making the image look flat. Those aren't the best HDR photos we've seen, but are definitely among the better ones, and we liked all of them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Panorama shots are available too. You can capture both landscape and portrait panoramic photos with an 180-degree field of view. Shooting is easy, but the stitching takes a while to complete. The result is rather disappointing, though - the resolution is about 2000x760px, and the image quality is quite poor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 features a 5MP front-facing camera for high-res selfies. The images come out soft with average detail, but will do for Facebook or similar social networks. Their contrast turned out good, as were the colors and the dynamic range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 is more than capable of pulling its weight in our Photo Comparison tool. You can see how it stacks against other 13MP snappers we've tested.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>1080p video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Xiaomi Redmi 3 camcorder has the same UI as the still camera. It supports time-lapse videos with customizable snapping interval.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Xiaomi Redmi 3 is capable or recording up to 1080p@30fps. The bitrate of the video recordings is uninspiring at about 15 Mbps while audio is captured at 96 Kbps with two channels (stereo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The resolved detail in the videos is modest but enough for the class. We noticed some over-sharpening though. The colors and contrast are good, and the framerate is smooth and consistent at 30fps. The dynamic range is average.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a 1080p video we've uploaded on YouTube.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can also download the 1080p video sample (15s, 28MB) taken straight off the Xiaomi Redmi 3.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here the Xiaomi Redmi 3 enters our video comparison tool. There are plenty of 1080p camcorders you can compare it against. It resolves an average level of detail, but contrast and colors are excellent.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Xiaomi Redmi 3 key test findings:<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Build quality is top-notch; the metal shell is a welcome change;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display is quite good with high maximum brightness level and high contrast; has average color accuracy;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Battery life is excellent with an endurance rating of 107h;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Rich wireless and wired connectivity options including an IR blaster and FM radio;</paragraph>
			<paragraph>MIUI 7 is a clean and light Android Lollipop launcher but with rich customization options. Unfortunately, the bootloader is locked and will require an official Xiaomi tool for unlocking, thus preventing the user from installing custom ROMs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Snapdragon 616 chipset is doing alright and has plenty of power for the 720p screen resolution.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Audio quality is excellent with an external amplifier and certainly better than you would expect with the headphones in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Camera photos are good, with above average resolved detail and dynamic range, good HDR photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 1080p video samples are OK but not impressive.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>There are phones you need to compare with others and weigh the pros and cons. And there are phones you know you can get right away with no second thoughts to follow. The Xiaomi Redmi 3 is of the latter kind, and if you've followed our review so far, you probably know it already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Just like the Redmi Note 3 and the Mi 4c, the Redmi 3 offers a lot more than its price suggests and you can tell Xiaomi has put lots of efforts building it. The attention to detail is noticeable immediately when you open the retail box - the Redmi 3 metal body and premium design can't be matched by any sub-?150 smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the Redmi 3 is not all about the looks. It is the whole package - an excellent display, snappy hardware, a good camera, decent battery life, and the latest MIUI 7 interface. It ticks all the right boxes, and you would find it hard to resist its attractive bargain price.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Redmi 3 is currently sold only in China, so almost every international store is offering gray imports, which may or may not come with the language you need. And now that Xiaomi locks its bootloaders changing the ROM down the road may not be as easy. You would also have to rely only on your store for hardware or software support, so that's another consideration to keep in mind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We couldn't find a phone to match the design and power of the Redmi 3 at this price point, so we increased our limit a bit to find matching competitors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the first device to match the Redmi 3 is the recently launched Oppo F1. It has the premium looks, the same display, and chipset, but focuses on the camera department - it has a 13MP rear snapper and an 8MP selfie shooter. The battery capacity is less impressive, though, and the F1 costs about ?230.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The plastic Meizu's m2 hit the shelves last July and is slightly cheaper than the Redmi 3. It has a similar 5" 720p display but runs on a less powerful quad-core processor. The rest is pretty much the same as on the Redmi 3. The Flyme launcher has a strong user base, so you may want to check it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.5" Meizu m1 metal will offer a bigger, and higher-res display, more powerful Helio X10 hardware and a metal unibody for some extra ?55. We found it quite a capable device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>ZTE's Nubia Z9 mini offers a 5" display with higher 1080p resolution and runs on a very similar Snapdragon 615 chip. It has the looks and even offers better cameras, but the Snapdragon 615 can choke in graphic-intensive tasks when powering a Full HD screen. The Z9 mini costs ?50 more, but we aren't sure if the extra screen resolution is worth the halved performance.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the Redmi Note 3 is what you need if you are after a bigger screen. For the extra ?30, you will be getting a larger version of the Redmi 3 with more powerful hardware and a higher resolution screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The verdict is quite easy - if you want a 5" smartphone, and you are on a budget, then the Xiaomi Redmi 3 seems like the perfect choice and we can recommend it in a heartbeat.</paragraph>
