			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have been working on the X10 for quite a long time, taking the utmost care to make sure its software offers the best user experience possible. They wanted their first droid to be perfect and perfection requires time. That?s right ? the XPERIA X10 is the first Android to roll off the Sony Ericsson assembly line, hard as it might be to believe. But it certainly is not the kind of the phone to quietly disappear in the crowd of first-generation droids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Androids just keep coming and a look at our front page will tell you any newcomer will need big ideas to make a splash. The popularity of Google?s mobile OS is reaching unprecedented levels and the handsets adopting Android grow in number every day. And while Microsoft will try to unify their Windows Phone 7 and limit customization, Google favor the opposite approach.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson immediately took on board the possibilities offered by customization and really ran with it. Their blue-themed interpretation breathes new life into the familiar Android OS and tries to give the user a whole new experience. But they didn?t stop there. The unique Timescape and Mediascape interfaces are supposed to give the XPERIA X10 a much-needed edge in the high-end class. Trying to compete with the HTC Sense is a tough job, but Sony Ericsson have managed to offer something completely different ? giving media and communications a central place in their UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>XPERIA X10 comes with top-notch hardware to meet its software demands. Here is the impressive specs sheet along with some potential drawbacks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Most of the XPERIA weaknesses are hardly deal breakers and most people could live with them. Sony Ericsson have done enough though to reassure everyone that the XPERIA X10 will be on a par with its Android rivals at the time of release. Don?t underestimate the amount of hard work put into the X10 during the long manufacturing process. The delay was definitely worth it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have also promised that Android 2.1 will at some point be available for the XPERIA X10 enabling the full use of the 16M color-ready display. Despite the capacitive technology, the X10 display won't be getting multi-touch support even with the latest OS. As it turns out, there are hardware obstacles to enabling multi-touch, so Android 2.1 can't help here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But no more small talk. Head to the next page where we start our traditional hardware inspection.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Another iPhone copycat package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It?s been just a week since we saw the tiny retail box of the Motorola BACKFLIP, and here goes another one. In fact, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 comes in an even smaller box, one that?s certainly not giving away the elaborate device hiding inside. It?s interesting how the minimalist retail package Apple chose for the first iPhone has now been copied by so many other manufacturers.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The cardboard box packs a charger and a microUSB cable. There is also a two-piece headset, but you are not limited to using this since the XPERIA X10 has a standard 3.5 mm jack.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nobody would possibly expect the XPERIA X10 to be compact. The 4-inch monster of a display occupying most of the front is the obvious reason for all the design decision-making. OK, the X10 is big ? it measures 119 x 63 x 13 mm, which almost matches the HTC HD2. But almost is the key word here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 weighs 20 grams less than the HD2 because of its plastic body, and that?s very noticeable in the hand. Despite the lack of metal on the casing, the X10 is solidly built, but that?s something we?ll go into a little bit more detail about later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing?s for sure though: the physical differences between the XPERIA X10 and its mini version tell the whole story. It?s impressive to see how small touchscreen smartphones can get. But equally impressive ? if you ask us ? what the XPERIA X10 can do for you in terms of screen and media.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A screen to like<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Being a full-touch handset the Ericsson XPERIA X10 had little room to maneuver on design. The huge touchscreen covers most of the front, while the back is pretty plain. The rounded edges certainly make it more palm-friendly ? essential for a handset this size. The asymmetric chrome accents on the side are subtle and elegant. Any more than that would?ve been improper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s also a white XPERIA X10 and that sure will be a sight to see. The black one we?re reviewing is obviously the more mature and conservative option. It?s a smartphone and it?s a multimedia phone ? it doesn?t need to follow a formal business dress code. But again, the sheer size of it doesn?t really allow too much embellishment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 4" capacitive touchscreen unit has a resolution of 854 x 480 pixels and great picture quality. Of course, that 65K-color limitation of the Android 1.6 Donut takes its toll occasionally, but unless it's single-color gradients that you are looking at, it won't really bother you in day-to-day use.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The default UI blue graphics have been carefully chosen not to reveal this weak spot. But don?t worry, Android 2.1 is fully capable of supporting 16M colors and Sony Ericsson promise it will come to the XPERIA X10 soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Contrast is excellent and the sunlight legibility is the best we?ve seen on a Sony Ericsson handset. In fact out there in the bright sun, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 is as good as the Apple iPhone. The X10 brightness is just a bit subdued but the image is vibrant and clean. A well-deserved thumbs up for the XPERIA X10 screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sensitivity of the display is great as well - just as you would expect in a capacitive touchscreen. The snappy Snapdragon also matters here as the real response of the system is dependent on the screen and the processor in equal measures.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as multi-touch support is concerned, Android 1.6 isn?t capable of working with those kind of gestures. Our hopes go for Android v2.1 - which has native multi-touch implementation - so we might see some of that if the X10 gets an upgrade. Multi-touch support is only a prerequisite for pinch zooming, it?s go to be implemented additionally to work.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: Sony Ericsson have officially confirmed that multi-touch the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 cannot be enabled because of hardware limitations.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Eye for detail<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As usual above the display we find the centrally placed earpiece. The ambient light sensor is hidden on its left, a small status LED on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The three keys below the display are nicely tactile with soft press and adequate feedback. Left to right, you get a Menu key, Home, and a Back key. Capacitive controls are trendy lately but the XPERIA X10 just took to long to be caught in this trend. There must be enough people anyway who do prefer hardware buttons and the X10 certainly won?t let them down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the handset features the shutter key and volume rocker, which also doubles as a zoom control. Those are both a bit small, but with very distinct and comfortable press.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left side of Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 features no controls whatsoever. Looking carefully you may find the tiny loudspeaker cleft here. Another aperture further down is possibly the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The top of the X10 hosts the 3.5mm audio jack, power key and the microUSB port. The universal connector is covered by a small plastic lid. The audio jack has no protection and you should clean it once in a while to avoid problems.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom of Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 there's a pretty large whole. That is where the lanyard should go if you use one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back of the handset features the 8 megapixel camera lens and the LED flash. As you might have guessed taking photos in low light is not the XPERIA X10?s strongest feature with this type of flash, but the occasional close-range shot of your buddies might be saved by the tiny LED.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there is no protection for the camera lens, so you should be particularly careful not to scratch it. It's recessed enough but any sharp objects in your pocket might get dangerously close.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The microSD card slot is under the battery and that means it's not hot-swappable. Having to restart the handset every time we need to access the card is not really our favorite thing but Sony Ericsson obviously didn't find room for it elsewhere.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality of the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 is solid. The matt plastic on the back is quite fingerprint resistant and soft to touch. It's only the front panel that takes on an increasingly smudgy appearance as the day goes by.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Although there are no metallic parts to strengthen the overall build quality, this actually turns out to be a good thing. The plastic used to craft the X10 body is excellent: strong and of very high quality. There are no creaks at all, and every single part of the body fits perfectly in its place. Thanks to the lack of metal the X10 is lighter than the HTC HD2 but doesn?t lose out in terms of design.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really like the rounded edges on the back ? the human curvature as called by Sony Ericsson design team. They can easily make you believe that the phone is slimmer than it is. XPERIA X10 is about the size of the original HTC Touch HD (but much lighter) so you can guess its size is very much pushing the limits of convenient single hand operation. We can however assure you, it feels perfectly comfortable in hand.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>User interface: Timescape meets Mediascape<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 runs version 1.6 of the Android OS which seems a bit outdated now that version 2.1 is already available on several handsets. The interface has been thoroughly customized though with Timescape and Mediascape. Plus, v 2.0 compatibility is in the picture too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two custom add-ons aside, it?s the well known Android interface we find here. You get three homescreen panes full of widgets, shortcuts or folders, and a main menu, which is pulled up from the bottom of the screen when needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A major advantage of Android is the notification area. It's a thin bar at the top of the screen with status info about battery, signal strength and others such as Bluetooth or missed events. But if you slide it down you get a list of all recent notifications - that's the so-called notifications area.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since you can open the notification area from wherever the top bar is visible, new events won't interrupt your work. You can pull the tray down like a window blind just enough to see more details about what has happened and if it doesn't need your immediate attention you can let it roll back up and continue where you left off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To bring up the task switcher on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 you can press and hold the Home key just like on any other Android phone. It allows you access to the six most recently used apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 takes full advantage of the powerful hardware ? the fast-ticking 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and the massive 4? capacitive touchscreen. The UI is lively and fluid, and looks quite attractive too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is how the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 compares to its predecessor, the HTC Legend in terms of performance. We used the free Benhcmark and PiBenchmark apps from the Android Market for the test and the results are here for you to see.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are plenty of Android smartphones these days so you should already be familiar with the standard Android UI. Indeed, all the homescreen, lockscreen, menus and notifications have been re-designed to give the X10 a completely different feel than its Android siblings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But the changes are visual mostly, so we?d better concentrate on the real new stuff here. Namely, the Sony Ericsson Timescape and Mediascape add-ons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>They are actually two applications which should make your life easier, more connected and more fun. The Timescape will be your link to the world, your communicator, while the Mediascape is a media player to bring all your media contents together.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In other words, the Timescape and the Mediascape provide a novel and integrated way of accessing and managing your communications (including social networking) and your multimedia content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Timescape, the ultimate communicator<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Timescape brings all your communications together. It displays an aggregated view of your SMS, MMS, email, call log, Facebook and Twitter updates. Timescape has a tabbed structure, allowing you to filter the contents by type and get all relevant information in one place.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With Timescape you can not only see the latest activities and updates from your contacts but also share your own status, reply to received messages or call back if you have a missed call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can set Timescape as your default homescreen and let it act like a full-blown UI. In this case the different tabs for various communications will be displayed on top of the screen. On the bottom you?ll see 4 virtual buttons (shortcuts to Mediascape, phonebook, messaging, dialer). You will always get back to the Timescape screen when you hit the Home key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The advantage is you?ll have nine homescreen panes but they will all be communication-related. You?ll have to sacrifice the widget-inhabited homescreen panes of the stock interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If ? alternatively ? you stick with the standard Android homescreen, the Timescape will be just another app on your main menu. However, it will keep doing what it was meant to.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The Mediascape UI is actually no UI<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Mediascape is an application that brings together all the media content you can use on the handset ? both local and online. We can simply call it a fancy file browser and a media player. But we would be oversimplifying things.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Timescape, the Mediascape cannot be set as your default homescreen, so we?ll be taking a closer look at it later on in the media chapter of our Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X10 phonebook has been visually customized but the great functionality remained untouched. As before, the phonebook can store a lot of information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding a new contact you won?t see the standard list of uncountable fields with a plus or minus sign next to them but only 4 empty fields. However, you can add many new fields of any kind.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, in each Gmail account there's a special group called "Starred in Android" where these contacts go automatically. Linking contacts to Facebook or Twitter accounts is available too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are two contact search options ? a dedicated search field on top of the contact list, and an alphabet scroll to jump to names starting with a specific letter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding a photo to a contact is quite easy: when you select a photo, a cropping tool comes up allowing you to use any part of the photo you want. Adding a photo has another pleasing "side effect" - if you put a dialing shortcut for the contact on the screen, it uses the photo as an icon.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony could have been better<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 had no issues with reception and in-call quality. The sound is loud enough so you don?t need to always set the volume to maximum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the X10, just like the rest of the Android crowd (except for the HTC Hero and Legend), doesn?t feature smart dialing (or voice dialing for that matter).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In Android, the phonebook, call log and dialer are all part of the same application. You can easily search them by flick scrolling. The call log shows all the dialed, received and missed calls all in one list.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also ran our traditional loudspeaker test on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10. We weren't overwhelmed but the X10 still snatched an average score. More info on our loudspeaker test as well as other results can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging: now we?re? texting<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android SMS and MMS departments are quite straightforward and simple - there are no folders here, just a new message button. Under that button is a list of all your messages organized into threads.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Composing a message is a little frustrating since the text box with the message still occupies a very small part of the screen giving you quite a small part of the text to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Converting an SMS to MMS is logical and easy. When you add multimedia content to the message, it is automatically turned into an MMS. You can just add a photo or an audio file to go with the text or you can choose to go into a full-blown MMS editor, depending on your needs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Moving on to email, the Gmail app supports batch operations, which allow multiple emails to be archived, labeled or deleted.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a generic email app for all your other email accounts and it can handle multiple POP or IMAP inboxes. You have access to the messages in the original folders that are created online, side by side with the standard local ones such as inbox, drafts and sent items.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Google Talk handles the Instant Messaging department. The GTalk network is compatible with a variety of popular clients like Pidgin, Kopete, iChat and Ovi Contacts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input options<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As for text input options, the X10 offers a couple of on-screen full QWERTY keyboards. Even on the portrait keyboard typing is pretty comfortable, keys are large enough and well spaced.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Flipping the phone to landscape however tells a whole new story. The large on-screen keyboard takes more than half the screen and gives you large, easy to press buttons. The X10 is probably as good as you will ever need ? in virtual keyboard terms of course. For proper typing, we guess, you should check out the Motorola Milestone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when it comes to social networking, the XPERIA X10 is a true expert. With the X10, SNS integration has reached a new level. You will find them everywhere: on the homescreen, in the phonebook, and in the main menu as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is support for some of the most popular social networks (including Facebook, Twitter and the German VZnet). You can update your status, upload images, contact your friends and see what?s going on.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
	</page>
	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Mediascape: all media in one place<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Mediascape keeps all the media content in three different categories ? Music, Video and Photo. Sure enough, the Music and Photo tabs are very similar - they show your recently added, recently viewed/played files and your favorites in small rows of thumbnail images at the top of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The magic however is in the lower part of the screen, which is dedicated to relevant online content ? if you link your X10 to a Facebook/Picasa/Flickr account you will be able to access your web photos or search the Sony Ericsson media store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also mentioned there's a Video tab, remember? Well, there is no online access here but you get all your videos in a plain and easy to use thumbnail view. Like most of its Android siblings, the XPERIA X10 lacks support for DivX and XviD videos and those files (if there are any stored in your memory card) don't even get listed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the three tabs feature a More button, which will lead you to the full-featured galleries. Choosing more in the Music tab will lead you to the typical music player sorting ? recently added, recently played, favorites, albums, tracks, genres, etc.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The music and video player have pretty much identical interfaces with neat styling and straightforward controls. A short while ago the Symbian-powered Satio and Vivaz got equalizers but at this stage there is still none for the music player of the Android-run X10.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Timescape gallery is originally meant to work in portrait mode only. The gallery contents can be filtered by Recently Viewed, Favorites, Albums and Friends. Images in each category are then displayed on a separate screen. Even if you choose to view all the pictures stored on the handset unfiltered, you will still be looking at a single vertically scrollable screen of thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Only when you select a single image, the accelerometer comes into play allowing you to auto-rotate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunatley, image browsing involves a notable lag. However, zooming is reasonably fast. As we mentioned before, there is no multi-touch, so you will count on the dedicated virtual buttons or on double tapping.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Items in the galleries (albums and tracks in the music library, images in the gallery) all have an added Infinite button, which has been often praised in Sony Ericsson marketing materials.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Touching the button, will list all the related content ? both local and online.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For instance, you can view all the other tracks in the same music album, all the images taken on the same day, related content in the PlayNow media store or even related videos on YouTube. You can even start a relevant Google search.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Update 08 Apr: After we updated our Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 to the latest version of its firmware its audio output improved greatly and the handset achieved excellent results in our test.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 is still pretty quiet in terms of pure volume, but noise levels reading (indicating the signal-to-noise ratio) and the dynamic range are now excellent and comparable to the best in class.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is still spot-on for the entire audible range.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The distortion levels are also top-notch and generally the XPERIA X10 has no weak points as far as its audio output is concerned.And here go the results so you can see for yourselves.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 vs Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 mini frequency response graphs</paragraph>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>8 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 sports an 8 megapixel camera with LED flash capable of taking photos at a maximum resolution of 3264 x 2448 pixels.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson have designed their own camera interface from scratch and it takes us back to the golden days of Cybershot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the left viewfinder bar you will find five options - capturing mode, resolution, scenes, focus mode and camcorder switch. On the opposite you can set the exposure compensation and go to the camera album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are four capturing modes - normal, scene recognition, smile detection and touch capture. Scene recognition is essentially auto mode whereby the X10 will determine what setting to shoot in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are five focus modes available - single or multi autofocus for focusing on more than one spot, touch focus, macro mode, face detection and infinity for capturing landscapes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, there is one really handy addition - the recent shot tray. It appears at the bottom right corner and shows the last pictures taken as small thumbnails.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera interface puts a lot of options on the viewfinder so they?re a touch away (they can be hidden of course), but to get to the rest you need the extended settings menu. It includes options like geotagging, image stabilization, self-timer, even ?smile level? to tweak the sensitivity of the smile detection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One pitfall is that the LED light needs to be turned on manually each time you need it and that setting is buried into the extended settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A cool, iPhoto-like feature is the face recognition. Snap a photo of someone (it works with up to five faces in a photo) and their face will be tagged ? automatically if you?ve already tagged that person, or you can do it manually if you haven?t or the automatic recognition fails for some reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After that?s done, when viewing a photo with you can tap the name tag, which brings the options to view the contact, show all photos with that contact, or change or delete the name tag. Viewing all photos for a contact is available through the contacts entry in the Contacts app as well.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Image quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 takes pretty good photos with excellent detail and colors. There are no visible problems with the lens or processing algorithm. There are some things here and there that need polishing, but we are more than satisfied with the results.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 takes pretty good photos with very low noise levels ? the noise reduction algorithm does its job well and thanks to the 8MP sensor there?re plenty of pixels to work with.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The color rendering is good, the only thing to note is the X10 camera tends to leave the shadows slightly underdeveloped.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 08 Apr: We also took a couple of shots with the XPERIA X10 camera to see if the new firmware affects the image quality as well. The results turned out identical to the initial photos and subtle differences can be attributed to the lighting differences, rather than image processing algorithm modifications. Check them out below.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. You can see how the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 image quality compares to that of some of the other handsets we have reviewed. Clicking any of the following three images will take you to our dedicated page for some pixel-peeping pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>WVGA video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 captures video in WVGA resolution (800 x 480 pixels vs. 720 x 480 for D1) at 30fps. In reality the frame rate is a bit lower because of occasional doubled frames. It hovers around 27fps, which is good enough by our books.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Videos are captured in MP4 format with AAC audio. The resolved detail is lower than on 720p videos, but it?s the next best thing. It?s more than enough for snapping basic movies on the go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample WVGA video clip by the XPERIA X10.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity: 3G, Bluetooth file transfers and all<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Connectivity is strong with the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 ? quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE, three localized versions - each with tri-band 3G, 7.2Mbps HSDPA and 2Mbps HSUPA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Local connectivity is well covered too ? Wi-Fi b/g with DLNA, Bluetooth 2.1 with A2DP and file transfers. Now, that?s quite a rarity for the droid folk ? especially at ver.1.6. There?s also a microUSB port for connecting with a PC (including mass storage mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned the available microSD memory card slot is not hot swappable, as you have to remove the battery to access it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flashless browser<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android web browser has always been good, although the newer version we?ve seen on Android 2.0 has a better, more intuitive UI. Still, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 browser renders most pages flawlessly and is very snappy.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The XPERIA X10 doesn?t have pinch zooming, so instead it relies on the +/- zoom buttons and the magnifying glass feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Double-tap zooming is missing as well (it was added in Android 2.0).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The magnifying glass zooms out until the page fits horizontally on the screen and then gives you a virtual magnifying glass, which you move with your finger. It?s perfect for navigating large, content-heavy pages or you could use the find on page feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's text reflow and keeps the columns of text exactly as wide as the screen ? essential for comfortable reading.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is of course support for multiple tabs ? hit the Windows button to view a grid of the open pages displayed as thumbnails. The thumbnail feature in the bookmarks is missing however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Typically, Flash support is missing in the browser, though the YouTube application partially makes up for that.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 comes with a nicely stocked organizer and that includes a document viewer, which sometimes gets left out on Androids.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The document viewer in question is Quickoffice and it has support for viewing document files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PDF, including the Office 2007 versions). For editing, you will need to get the paid app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The large, high-resolution screen makes reading documents a very comfortable task and the Snapdragon CPU makes panning blazing fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The doc viewer integrates with the Gmail app, which makes viewing attachments a cinch. You can?t download them to the phone?s internal memory however. Attaching all kinds of files is possible though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has four different types of view - daily, weekly, monthly and agenda view. Adding a new event is quick and easy, and you can also set an alarm to act as a reminder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Agenda view shows a list of all the calendar entries from the recent past to the near future. It?s a very handy tool when you need to check your appointments for the next few days.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is a calculator aboard, but this one is an improvement over the stock calculator. It is nicely touch optimized and has some advanced functions (square root, trigonometric functions, etc.).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 also features an alarm clock application, which allows a lot of alarms to be set, each with its own start time and repeat pattern.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YouTube app has a simple interface that lets you browse and view videos. It?s there to make up for the lack of Flash support in the browser.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you somehow end up on the desktop version of the YouTube site, you will be offered to view the video in the YouTube app instead. Of course, Flash on the web is much more than just YouTube, but the YouTube app is better than nothing.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>GPS navigation is on trial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 comes with a capable GPS receiver, which got a lock in under two minutes. Of course, you can enable A-GPS and speed the process up. Google Maps is of course preinstalled, but for voice guided navigation, there?s the Wisepilot app. It?s just a 30 day trial, after that you?d have to buy a license.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice-guided turn-by-turn navigation through Google Maps is available in the US only. Still, even without Navigation, there is some kind of guidance: your route and current location appear on the screen so you'll reach your destination eventually... assuming you can read maps of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app also sports the Street View mode. In fact, this mode is probably the best part of Google Maps. If the Street View is available in the area you're interested in, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of the surroundings. When the digital compass is turned on it feels like making a virtual tour of the location!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Wisepilot is a pretty popular choice for a preloaded SatNav application on both feature phones and smartphones. It has a simple, touch-friendly interface that relies on big icons, which are both easy to see and hit with your thumb.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The route calculation settings are quite simple ? you set it to calculate the fastest route, the shortest, have it prefer motorways and so on. There are several map overlays available that show traffic and road conditions (including road works). Wisepilot will also alert of speed traps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing about Wisepilot, however, is that it requires a license for voice guided navigation (after the trial period expires) and it downloads data off the Internet. That makes it unsuitable (or at least really expensive) for use abroad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Android Market offers a lot of free alternatives, some of which are actually usable.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Android Market and its growing catalog of apps<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Android Market on the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 is the older version that came with earlier OS editions. The difference is merely cosmetic, so you?re not losing out much in terms of usability.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Keep in mind that some of the newer apps require Android 2.0 or even 2.1, but most work with 1.6.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The structure of the Android Market is quite simple ? featured apps on top and above them, three sections (Applications, Games and Downloads). There is also a shortcut up there for initiating a search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Applications and Games sections are divided into subsections (e.g. Communication, Entertainment etc.) so you can filter the apps that are relevant to you. Of course, there is also an option of displaying them all at once, but you will probably need days to browse them all that way.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Searching is very easy ? just tap the search button, type what you?re looking for (e.g. ?navigation?). From then on, it?s pretty easy to choose ? each app has a rating, a short description by the author, user comments and screen shots.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Applications vary from pretty silly (including a lightsaber app) to real must-have's (including file managers, navigation software and more), but that?s true for every other app store.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, 30000 or so apps is nowhere near what the iPhone users have at their disposal but no one actually installs thousands of apps so you will probably find what you are looking for here. Besides, the Android market is the one with the largest percentage of free apps across all platforms.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 is company?s first Android-powered device. But being first is not always a good thing. You have to face some serious initial expectations and justify them. That is the best case scenario. But obviously Sony Ericsson haven?t read that script. Even now, several months after our two X10 previews, there are still some final touches needed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really hope we?ll get a new software update quite soon and we?ll be able to write off many of the stuff we frowned at this time around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That put aside, the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 is a promising device with (mostly) bright future waiting for it. It?s quite a looker, as you see, but it?s also powerful and smart.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You just can?t miss the zippy 1GHz processor, or the marvelous 4? capacitive display which takes the whole front. The 8-megapixel autofocus snapper on the back either. On top of that you get great connectivity capabilities and all the popular social networks which are a tap away from you no matter where you are in the phone menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two UIs, namely the Timescape and the Mediascape (which is actually not a general UI, but a media interface), look fresh and do great what they were meant to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But there?s still some stuff that needs polishing. And Android ver. 1.6 is now considered almost outdated ? especially for a high-end flagship.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good thing from a user?s point of view though is that there are at least four other devices that you can choose from in this market segment.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Google Nexus One and its brother from a different father, the HTC Desire, are just as powerful as the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 but both have some advantages over the X10. They feature the latest (so far) version of the Android OS, support multi-touch and have AMOLED touchscreens and a little bit more RAM memory. However, both can?t match the 8-megapixel camera of the XPERIA.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  HTC Google Nexus One ? HTC Desire</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up is another smartphone made by HTC, the WinMo-based HTC HD2. Windows Mobile devices, as we know them now, are a dying breed but that shouldn?t discourage you from buying one of those. The HD2 has a huge capacitive touchscreen display able to deliver excellent image quality. Also on board is the well-known 1GHz Snapdragon CPU as well as an inbuilt GPS receiver and support for the standard connectivity trio ? HSDPA, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. You also get a 5-megapixel autofocus sharpshooter recording VGA videos at 30fps. Not to mention the access to a huge choice of third-party apps (although not as conveniently concentrated in a single AppStore).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HTC HD2</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Last but not least is the iPhone 3GS. Its processor isn?t that fast, there is no multi-tasking, the display doesn?t measure 4 inches and is of lower resolution. The camera is a joke, and a bad one too. However, there is still no device that can beat iPhone?s UI and the overall experience (not to mention its industry-leading AppStore).</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Apple iPhone 3GS</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we already mentioned, we expect the retail firmware update to come knocking on our door any moment now, so we?ll update this review should we see improvements in any aspect of the XPERIA X10. For now it remains what it is ? a huge leap from what we saw several months back and an exceptional high-end cameraphone with only a few faults that can be exused.</paragraph>
