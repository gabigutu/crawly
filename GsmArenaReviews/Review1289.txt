		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A fresh dose of oxygen or a new torchbearer? It doesn?t matter which one you think RIM needed to keep the flame alive. They got both in the new BlackBerry Torch 9810. Double the processing power, the new sped-up and brushed-up BlackBerry OS 7 and higher resolution displays, RIM know giving users what they need is no longer enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new BlackBerry generation is encouraging users to want more. It?s not about suddenly waking the typical BlackBerry customer up to the business benefits of HD video. Nor is a bump in screen resolution and processing power enough to convince the masses to ditch their droids and iPhones and come flocking to BlackBerry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s a step though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We ended our review of the original BlackBerry Torch 9800 by calling it a step in the right direction. Good to see, RIM have not lost momentum or changed direction. Quite the contrary. The BlackBerry Torch 9810 may as well be a manual on how to make a good sequel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s almost nothing on the outside to suggest the amount of progress made inside. It?s the same phone, down to the last millimeter and gram. But it?s a major leap forward to a 1GHz+ CPU, a VGA screen, HD video and a more compelling touchscreen experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Things look good for the BlackBerry Torch 9810 and some of it is down to the fact that, out of all the new generation Berries, it has the most comfortable starting position. The Torch 9860 drew the shortest straw we guess, no keyboard and all. What?s the point of a BlackBerry phone that can?t give you the blackberry thumb? The Bold Touch 9900, being the flagship, will inevitably be held to higher standards.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The strength of the Torch 9810 on the other hand is in its power to surprise without being unpredictable. It may keep a low profile but won?t escape the attention of anyone after a solid smart messenger. And we don?t mean the brand-loyal only. It?s the right phone to offer to long-term customers, no doubt about that. Hopefully, the added speed and skill puts it on the radar for a wider range of users too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>OK, then. What we have here is a minor facelilft and a major software upgrade. There?s supposed to be a better phone on the other end of the equation and we?re about to start discovering it. Join us after the break for the hardware examination.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The basic accessories<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9810 doesn?t get beyond the must-have items. No leather holster, not even a memory card in the package we had. A polishing cloth is the closest to a bonus there is. All the basics are covered though. You get a USB cable, a charger head and a set of 3.5mm earphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Torch 9810 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9810 is by no means compact, even with the slider open it struggles to hide its bulk. It seems nothing can be done about the extra padding around the waistline. At 111 x 62 x 14.6 mm, the Torch 9810 is quite a handful but that?s fair for what you get ? a 3.2? touchscreen and a full QWERTY keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>161 g sound too much perhaps for an all-plastic handset but we do like the solid and reliable feel all that weight seems to give. At the same time, the phone is perfectly manageable and remains reasonably pocketable.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The portrait slider is a rare from factor and we think it?s an advantage for the BlackBerry Torch 9810. It sets it apart in a crowd of smart messenger side-sliders. The styling is very conservative, the right thing to do with a phone this big. The major difference to the original Torch 9800 is the rear. The battery cover has textured checkerboard finish instead of the ribbed rubber surface of the original.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is entirely made of plastic but it doesn?t feel cheap. We had doubts about the Torch 9860, but nothing of the sort here. The finish is simple, maybe a little too ordinary for a BlackBerry, but the phone looks good. That?s somehow different from calling it good-looking. Solid and reliable, at the very least.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The five controls on the front panel are the typical BlackBerry set. You get two keys on each side of the optical trackpad (Call and Menu on the left, Back and End key on the right). Although most of the navigation will be on the touchscreen, the trackpad will be busy enough, providing the needed accuracy in the browser or when handling text. The buttons all have solid stroke and adequate feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We feared the screen of the Torch 9810 would do worse than that of the Bold Touch 9900. It turned out though, the lower pixel density doesn?t make any visible difference after all. The 3.2" VGA screen of the Torch 9810 is pleasingly crisp, with rich colors and good contrast. It?s very responsive too. The only thing to note is the lack of haptic feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility is excellent, to solidify the good impression recent BlackBerry smartphones have made. Viewing angles are about average though - there's some loss of contrast and color when you look at it at an angle, but everything remains legible.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slider run is smooth and solid, the phone opens and closes with ease and feels secure in the process. The four-row QWERTY keyboard is smaller than that of the Bold Touch 9900 and a little less comfortable to use. The keys are flat and tangibly stiffer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s not a bad keyboard by any stretch though. Many of the keys (not just the numbers) can be assigned speed dial. There is a dedicated currency symbol key and the usual command shortcuts: * locks the keypad and screen, while # toggles Silent mode on/off. Numbers share keys with some of the letters and you need to press the alt key to use them at times. The good thing is that whenever the context allows it, the switch is automatic.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The slider form factor allows reasonably comfortable typing. The phone does feel a bit head heavy but the keyboard allows a pretty good grip ? the chin helps here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the display we find the BlackBerry logo, the earpiece and the status LED on the right. The proximity sensor, which disables the screen during calls, is here too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The MicroUSB port handles both data transfers and charging. It is located on the left side of the Torch 9810.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the Torch 9810 features three tiny rubbery knobs - the volume up and down keys and the convenience key. The latter is set by default to serve as a shutter key, which it does pretty well, with distinct half press for focusing. The keys are exactly the same layout and size as in the original Torch 9800.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the top of the BlackBerry Torch 9810 you'll find the company?s trademark hidden keys. The Lock key is on charge of turning the screen on and off while the Mute key doubles as a Play/Pause button when playing music and videos. The thin slit of the loudspeaker is here too but you might even not notice it right away.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s nothing of note at the bottom of the Torch 9810. There?s plenty of space to accommodate carrier logos ? as our AT&amp;T-branded unit shows.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back panel is made out of thin plastic that we suggest you be careful with. You?re supposed to slide it open and it takes quite a push to release. The textured surface looks nice and helps get a better grip. Rearside, the Torch has the 5 megapixel camera lens, along with a single LED flash.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch has a 1270 mAh Li-Ion battery that doesn?t get in the way of the memory slot. The microSD card is hot-swappable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RIM claim 308h/300h of stand-by (2G or 3G, respectively) and 6:30/5:50 hours of talk time. Music playback should be around 54h. We gave the Torch 9810 a pretty good squeeze, with all of our usual tests, plenty of browsing over Wi-Fi, audio quality and imaging checks. It usually made it through a day of heavy use. If used sparingly, the Torch 9810 will probably give you two or three days on a single charge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9810 is based on exactly the same chassis as the original 9800 Torch. There?re minor differences in the finish but nothing we would call an upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The build quality is excellent, never mind the all plastic construction. But again, that was the case with the original Torch 9800 too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The actual upgrades are elsewhere ? the screen is the only part that?s on the outside. From that point on though, the Torch 9810 promises a whole new experience. And it feels they didn?t want to distract users with fancy designs and ornaments. A big phone weighing 161 grams doesn?t need any of that anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All the heft handles reasonably well, the handset may occasionally feel too tall and too heavy when typing long texts.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry OS 7: touch, track and type<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The new OS 7 is hardly breaking news, with not one but two BlackBerry reviews behind our back already. The BlackBerry Torch 9810 is pretty much the same package in terms of software and features as the Bold Touch 9900. The slider form factor finds room for a bigger screen but the keyboard is a bit cramped for space.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We are going to look at the OS 7 in detail again, for a complete and comprehensive coverage of the phone and its features. There are parts of reused text but that's inevitable given most of the interface is the same, only on a different scale. And you can rest assured that all the BlackBerry Torch 9810 specifics are duly reflected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Number 7 is the last upgrade of the OS before the switch to QNX. The OS 7 brings very few new features (NFC and HD video are well worth a mention though) and focus should be on the user experience instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new platform is based on a 1.2 GHz processor and more potent graphics hardware, and it?s exactly the higher system requirements that won?t allow older BlackBerry phones to run the new OS 7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here goes our traditional video demo to warm you up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry OS 7 is trying to look like the QNX-based Tablet OS. The UI icons have been updated to mimic the PlayBook, but the rest is pretty much the same - functionality changes are kept to a minimum.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The status area of the homescreen has virtual buttons in a row, allowing you to quickly toggle the cellular, Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth radios. It gives you quick access too to the alarm clock and settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Clicking on the loudspeaker icon underneath lets you change the currently active profile, while the magnifying glass on the other side of the homescreen lets you start a search. BlackBerry OS 7 is voice search enabled, too. Tapping on a small mic icon next to the Search bar will activate it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Missed events - SMS, email or missed calls - can be quickly accessed by pressing the bar between the search and profile icons on the default screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below that is the app tray, which consists of several tabs. You can easily swipe it out of sight or pull it up to show one to five rows of icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sideways swipes reveal the different panes that sort the main menu into All, Favorites, Media, Downloads and Frequent. The frequently used apps list are auto populated by the system. You can define which of the main menu panes should be shown. Folders can be added to the main menu and items can be moved into folders.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can either use the menu key or tap and hold on an icon to reveal options such as Move, Mark as Favorite, Move to folder.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, there is a trackpad and there is a touchscreen. The trackpad is the usual sharp and precise control. One place where it makes a lot of sense is in listed submenus that pop up as you press the Menu key. Not that they are not thumbable - it's just that wrong presses are completely ruled out with the trackpad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pretty much everything you see is clickable in BlackBerry OS 7 and works the way it's supposed to. There are still small elements such as the homescreen Search and Profiles icons, which are easier to access via the trackpad rather than the touchscreen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The important thing to note is that, unlike the flat iOS layout, the Torch 9810 has a menu button to access options that are not visible on the screen. You get used to that pretty quickly though so in the end, the Torch 9810 manages to keep both new and returning users happy. Trackpad and touchscreen complete each other in a natural way.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>A simple, yet powerful phonebook<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9810 may run a new edition of the OS, but its phonebook is the same as before.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The contacts get listed alphabetically by first, last name or company and you can pick which of their recent activities get displayed. Smart search lets you find a specific contact by typing a part of the name, so navigation is pretty fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like previous BlackBerry devices, the Torch 9810 lets you put your contacts in one of two categories - personal and business and then filter your phonebook accordingly. There is also grouping available and you can create as many custom groups as you like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In edit mode, the available contact details are neatly organized. You can replicate some of the fields and add custom ones easily.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Telephony has everything<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In calls, the BlackBerry Torch 9810 is the usual solid performer. No voice quality or reception issues. Smart dial is of course enabled - you only need an extra tap on the Search button to bring up the virtual QWERTY keyboard. It's still a quick way of locating contacts on the handset. You just punch a few keys straight on the homescreen and a list of suggestions is promptly returned. You can then select the contact you need with the trackpad or tap directly on its icon to initiate a call.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Voice Dial is also available via the Universal Voice Search.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9810 scored a Below Average mark in our traditional loudspeaker test, which is quite unusual for a RIM phone and it's likely you miss a call or two.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9810 handles has all kinds of messages. You get SMS, MMS and email support out of the box and there are also a few IM apps preinstalled.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, a BIS account is a must if you are to use email on the Torch 9810. And while we understand the advantages of the BlackBerry internet service, it would have been nice to give users some kind of choice. You know ? you can go for the security we offer or you can use whatever internet plan you have and live without it. Without an enterprise account, your only option is web-based email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And we shouldn?t forget that not all carriers are offering BIS. Still if you do get a subscription you can check out the nicely organized and easily customizable client, which has deservedly earned its name over the years.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos can be resized for sending, emails can be flagged and filtered by request, color and status, while folders can be created, edited and deleted on the device itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The message editors, which look identical for all types of messages, are pretty simple to use and with a neat interface. There is a counter at the top indicating the remaining characters to 160, and another one showing the number of parts the message will break down into for sending. That one turns into a data counter if you are creating an MMS or email.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Entering recipients is as quick and convenient as it gets. You just start typing and smart-dial kicks in, giving you a list of suggestions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Complete with a QWERTY keyboard, the Torch 9810 makes traditional BlackBerry users feel at home. A virtual keyboard is available too in both landscape and portrait but none gets even close to the real thing, the physical keys. However, the Torch's keyboard is smaller than that of the Bold Touch 9900 and a little less comfortable to use. The keys are flat and tangibly stiffer than on the Bold Touch.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's still incomparably better than the virtual keyboard, which is struggling for space even in landscape. And then, there is the added convenience. Many of the keys (not just the numbers) can be assigned speed dial. There is a dedicated currency symbol key and the usual command shortcuts: * locks the keypad and screen, while # toggles Silent mode on/off. Numbers share keys with some of the letters and you need to press the alt key to use them at times. The good thing is that whenever the context allows it, the switch is automatic.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery covers the basics<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The image gallery hasn't changed since the OS 6, so it should be familiar to all the BlackBerry users already.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Images can be browsed in grid or viewed as a standard list. There?s searching by name here too, but we?re not the type that remembers the names of our image files, so we won?t count that one in favor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unlike the Bold Touch 9900, the Torch 9810 has a built-in accelerometer to automatically toggle portrait and landscape mode as you browse your picture collection. There's a noticeable lag in the auto-rotation though, which tends to get pretty annoying. And it doesn't just affect the image gallery. This may be a minor glitch of our test unit but the accelerometer does seem to act up.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Picture browsing is pretty fast and so are panning and zooming, including the pinch zoom. A tap and hold on a picture provides shortcuts for sending, copying and renaming. You can set it as wallpaper as well or use as a contact photo. Further options such as image properties, rotate or slide show are available in a popup menu.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A good music player<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Surely RIM have refreshed the Music Player icons, but that?s basically all they did. It?s still pretty conservatively styled, but most of the functionality has been there since BlackBerry OS 5.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There?s quick searching of tracks and automatic sorting by artist, album and genre. Creating custom playlists is also supported.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Album art is on the list of included features too, along with equalizer presets and the single track repeat option.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite naturally, the player can also be minimized to play in the background. You can then go back to it via the task manager or the main menu. Pausing it by hitting the mute button is also possible, but unfortunately, there's no indication of the currently playing song on the home screen.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Video player does good job as usual<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We liked the Bold Touch 9900 for its video-playing capabilities and the Torch 9810 should be even better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bigger screen is an obvious advantage. The video player's interface might not be too impressive, but the functionality is mostly there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are the usual playback controls when you hit a key or tap on the screen plus a dedicated fit/zoom to screen one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9810 video player promises to support DivX, XviD, H.264/MPEG-4 and WMV videos up to 720p resolution. It did manage to play all of the DivX files we threw at it, WMV, MOV and MP4 files up to 720p were no problem either, but the XviD ones didn?t go that easy. Some of the files were OK, while others where just incompatible. It seems it's a bit rate or audio thing, but we won't count on that XviD support much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance here is decent, which is probably more than most BlackBerry users will ever need.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio output is loud but not quite perfectly clear<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9860 is among the loudest devices we have tested, but unfortunately its audio output isn't the cleanest we have seen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With no resistance applied to the line-out (i.e. the active external amplifier) the Torch 9810 does decently. Its signal-to-noise, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk reading are actually quite impressive. The frequency response is relatively precise, too. Distortion levels are a quite a bit higher than average for that scenario, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Quite serious issues arise when you plug in a pair of headphones, though. The volume levels do drop a bit, but the main problem is the surge in stereo crosstalk - it really goes through the roof with this one. Not to mention that even more distortion creeps in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here come the full results so you can see for yourselves:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Great 5 megapixel camera<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9810 comes with a 5 megapixel auto-focus camera which is still the highest resolution you can get in a RIM smartphone. Auto-focus prompted a sigh of relief after the experience we had with the Bold Touch 9900.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera comes with the same unattractive interface and relatively low number of customizable settings. A shortcut bar at the bottom of the viewfinder is standing in the way of proper framing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The shutter key is unusually shaped but actually quite comfortable with distinct half-press for auto-focusing. By the way, you can set auto-focus mode to continuous. If nothing else, it's the quicker and easier way, and you can shoot with a single press of the trackpad, shutter key or the virtual shutter key.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Geotagging, flash and scenes can be accessed straight in the viewfinder and those are just about the only options you get with the Torch 9810. The only other thing you can customize is image resolution, which is located in the advanced settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are no settings for exposure compensation, white balance, ISO or anything like that. There is face detection, but that is a dedicated scene, rather than a separate setting.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of image quality, the BlackBerry Torch 9810 is on par with the Bold Touch 9900 but autofocus makes a big difference in close-ups. The photos are above average in quality - good amount of resolved detail and pleasing colors. Contrast is fine too, but the noise levels are way above acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here go several samples so you can judge the image quality yourselves.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Photo quality comparison<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We?ve also added the BlackBerry Torch 9810 to the database of our Photo Compare Tool. Here you can see the Torch 9810 is a match with its other OS 7-based siblings. Compared to some of the most popular 5 megapixel droids such as HTC EVO 3D and Desire S, Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY, LG Optimus 3D and Black, and Samsung Galaxy S you can clearly see the Torch 9810 is also on par or even better when it comes to resolved detail and accurate colors. The lighter noise reduction plays a part in that too, it's a technique we've already met in the iPhone 4.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent HD video recording<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9810 is part of the new generation of HD video-enabled phones by RIM - along with the Bold 9900 and Torch 9810. It is capable of shooting 1280x720px videos at 30 fps and can use the LED as video light.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The video quality is up to scratch ? the frame rate is good, the resolved detail is adequate, the noise levels tolerable, the colors accurate and the contrast is fine too. Our main concern is the higher compression levels applied in the processing, but that's to be expected in 3GP videos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here?s a 720p video sample from the Torch 9810 camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is another we've uploaded to YouTube for your convenience.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Connectivity misses NFC<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9810 is giving you a broad range of connectivity options, as you would expect from a modern day smartphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The quad-band GSM/GPRS/EDGE support secures global roaming and the quad-band 3G with 14.4Mbps HSDPA and 5.76Mbps HSUPA gives you the extra speed. The dual-band Wi-Fi is also a nice addition with an easily customizable Wi-Fi manager taking care of all the connections. Wi-Fi hotspot is also supported. Stereo Bluetooth rounds off the list of wireless connectivity options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9810 has a standard microUSB port that is enabled for both data connections and charging. Once connected, you can sync your data with the BlackBerry Desktop Software. It allows you to sync your iTunes collection, save for the files that have DRM.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9810 is not NFC-capable - only the flagship Bold Touch 9900 gets that treatment.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>The web browser has its ups and downs<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The web browser on the BlackBerry Torch 9810 is a nice improvement for the BB platform. It is comparably fast and responsive, it supports multi-touch zooming, text selection, text reflow, mouse cursor, etc. The only thing missing is Flash support really.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now it does have its woes, we?ll give it that. Based on the Apple?s WebKit engine and using a similar caching system as the iPhone, the new BB browser reacts surprisingly like the one on the iPhone 4. Unfortunately, its performance is not the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You see, both browsers use what is known as a backing store to cache the already rendered page thus they show showing users a texture, rather than a real page. This way you always get a great performance while panning or interacting with the page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When you zoom in, the browser is not ready with the new texture, so it simply zooms in the already rendered one, effectively upsizing it, which makes both the text and images look blurry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now here?s where the difference in the performance of the iPhone 4 and the BlackBerry Torch 9810 shows up. When you zoom in on a portion of the text, on the BlackBerry it does take a second or two to clear up the hazy cached image of the text, while on the iPhone 4 that?s an instantaneous action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, you got speed in panning and scrolling, even in zooming because the texture is quick to refresh rather than to zoom on a heavy page, but you get a little annoying refresh moments on zooming.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now that's something you won't see on a stock Android browser because the fonts there are rendered in real time. But the heavier the page is on Android, the longer the refresh time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, again unlike the stock Android browser, the text reflow works only once - when the text is out-zoomed and you double tap on it. The text reflow stops working when you zoom in even more or turn the phone in landscape mode. The iPhone 4 web browser works the same way however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we won?t bore you to death with these little nitpickings. The BlackBerry Torch 9810 web browser is a fast and modern piece of software, it renders pages nicely almost like a desktop browser and it will always get the job done unless you?re reaching for some Flash content.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It?s interesting that if you decide to use the trackpad for navigation instead of the touchscreen, you'll get a virtual mouse cursor and automatic panning and scrolling when you reach the end of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Except for the missing Flash support, the handset provides a solid browsing experience.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>True to its business objectives, the Torch 9810 has a solid set of organizer tools. Although the interface is not preoccupied with looks, the usability cannot be called into question.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar has monthly, weekly and daily view modes and allows easily customized events to be set up. We have to admit that some event presets would have been useful but the device fails to provide them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone comes with the full version of Quick Office pre-installed allowing it to view all kind of documents (incl. PDF) and edit Word, Excel or Power Point files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The organizer package also includes a calculator with a built-in unit-converter, as well as a voice recorder and a Notes application. A handy To-do manager allows you to set-up and organize your upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The alarm application has only one alarm slot and fails to impress. It's quick to turn on but most of its settings can only be accessed via the menu and trackpad. You can set the tone, snooze time and the volume as well as the vibration intensity. Given the single slot limitation though, getting an alternative alarm clock app from the BlackBerry App World seems like the right thing to do.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is another way to get more alarms though. You can go the the Calendar app and choose to add a new alarm from the menu. It allows you to put subject and recurrence too and works just like the alarm in the Clock app.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry Torch 9810 comes with a stopwatch and a timer. Both are accessed from the clock application and have the usual functionality.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The clock comes on screen any time the phone is being charged and also offers a bedside mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There are also a Password Keeper app, Voice Recorder, Memos and Tasks app to store your passwords, voice memos, text memos and tasks. There is a digital compass too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Protect is onboard. It can locate and remotely lock/wipe your lost or stolen device. It also syncs your data and can easy transfer everything to a new BlackBerry device.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Finally, the BlackBerry Torch 9810 comes with Facebook and Twitter applications. You also get the native Social Feeds app that gathers all of your Facebook and Twitter updates in one place.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry App World<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The BlackBerry App World is the RIM application distribution solution. Quite well organized, it accepts payment by credit card or Paypal. Some apps you can get for free of course. Apps can be managed on a computer. There are enough categories and a search box to make searching easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a basic filtering system as well - it allows you to check out the highest rated free and paid applications, as well as the newest titles. In general there's hardly much to complain about the BlackBerry App world interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of applications isn?t as impressive as in the App Store or the Android Market at just over 14500 apps, 3500 games and 12000 themes, and to make it worse only a small fraction of the titles are actually free (though some of the paid apps offer free trials).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>BlackBerry Maps works only with BIS<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>As one would expect nowadays, the BlackBerry Torch 9810 is equipped with a built-in GPS receiver and comes with A-GPS support. For navigation you get BlackBerry Maps preinstalled. Unfortunately it is yet another application that only works with a BlackBerry internet plan activated. And the only navigation option you get is directions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To get directions you can enter an address straight from your phonebook and you can also save your favorite spots so you don't have to type them every time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>BlackBerry Maps also allows you to send your location to anyone via email or SMS, and that rounds off a decent but certainly not spectacular application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also, addresses that are included in messages are automatically detected and can be displayed on the map at the expense of a few clicks. The map data has also been updated, including more cities than ever. We can still think of at least several apps with more detailed maps, but let's not get too picky here.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9810 completes our series of reviews of the new generation BlackBerry phones.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Qualcomm Snapdragon 1.2GHz processors, extra bit of RAM, the new OS 7 with Liquid Graphics, a bump in screen resolution and HD video - they're all one phone actually, different shape and size.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of all three phones however, the Torch 9810 is the one that doesn't completely start from scratch. It's a sequel to the original Torch 9800. Up from 9800 to 9810 doesn't seem like much but the numbers don't tell the whole story. The new Torch slider has plenty of upgrade value: better screen, more processing power, silkier interface and HD video. Not bad at all for a phone built on the exact same chassis as the predecessor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Torch 9810 is basically a Bold Touch rebodied into a slider. The key absence is NFC but the Torch is a different breed, more likely to mix business with pleasure. So the bigger screen gives more credibility to its improved media skills. Another important difference is the QWERTY keyboard. We found the one on the Torch 9810 slightly less comfortable than that of the Bold Touch. Only just though - and still incomparably better than having no physical keys at all. Most BlackBerry users will agree, we think.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Long-term users, committed to BlackBerry for the security of their service, will be pleased with the Torch 9810. It seems well on time too, released exactly a year after the predecessor. Their sales have always been carrier-centric and they're probably eyeing many original Torch 9800 users with contracts due for upgrade.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for newcomers, the Torch 9810 is the best BlackBerry can offer at this point - and that means more polished touchscreen experience, more speed, more power and some new skill. A warning is due though - RIM's phones always come with a hefty price tag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The latest are obviously the priciest and the Torch 9810 finds itself in a company it's not likely to enjoy. We won't make a fuss over it because if the BlackBerry service is a must, even the world's finest smartphones become irrelevant. For those who have a choice and want to exercise it, there's no shortage of Droid and Symbian messengers to choose from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Some of the more recent Motorola Droids and Milestones are an obvious alternative. The likes of the Nokia E7 and the Sony Ericsson Xperia pro are in the picture too. Even the new Sony Ericsson Xperia mini pro has a claim to stake, fresh from a massive upgrade. The HTC Desire Z will do too if you don?t mind a year-old package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>    Nokia E7 ? Sony Ericsson Xperia pro ? Sony Ericsson Xperia mini pro ? HTC Desire Z</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HP Pre 3 could've been one of the contenders - and a strong one too. But it wasn't meant to be. The Pre 3 was discontinued before it even made it to the markets. Sad story, but it helps appreciate RIM's commitment and effort even more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> HP Pre 3</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, RIM have themselves a fleet of new touch phones. The new generation is promising - and delivering - more power and better user experience. The BlackBerry Torch 9810 has an important role in that. The way we see it, it's not just a solid upgrade. It's trusted to provide continuity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new lineup we've just finished reviewing is a transitional generation. QNX is the way of the future. The OS 7 and the new Bold and Torch are the base to build on.</paragraph>
