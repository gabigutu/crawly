			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>They used to be big, later they became redundant. As soon as smartphones were ready to offer the same features, PDAs were on the way to becoming extinct. With a device like the Samsung Galaxy Note though, one can't help but wonder if they're making a comeback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's got a big touchscreen for reading and entering text, with a stylus for jotting down notes and sketches, with powerful hardware that beats most phones in processing power and features. Sounds like a new-age PDA to us.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The screen is part of the new HD SuperAMOLED line and boasts the impressive 1280x800 pixel resolution. It uses a PenTile matrix, but with 285ppi you can't really tell. Stretching over a whopping 5.3 inches, it makes browsing those web pages an almost tablet-like experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note shares the Exynos chipset with some of its Galaxy siblings, but it's the one with the 1.4GHz dual-core CPUs. We've already had a look at its performance and we can say it's blazing fast.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If it's becoming hard to keep track of all the features, here's the gist of the Galaxy Note specs in summarized form:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note at a glance<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note packs the same camera as the Galaxy S II, giving you 8MP stills and FullHD video recording. If the image quality is on par, the Note should easily beat its tablet competitors in the photography department.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One important area is portability - Samsung have made the device as small as possible (there's hardly any bezel around the screen) but 5.3" is pretty big. Figuring how to carry the Galaxy Note around will be a challenge, but if you find a way you can leave your phone at home - the Note has top of the line droid specs and full phone functionality too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Well, we've got our cargo pants on and we'll try and find room for the Samsung Galaxy Note. But first, we'll go over the hardware, join us on the next page.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>This test unit was kindly provided by CT MIAMI, a Samsung distributor for Latin America. The Galaxy Note will be available at CT MIAMI for wholesale customers on October 24 for $699.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Samsung Galaxy Note 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note measures 146.9 x 83 x 9.7 mm and weighs 178g. That puts it halfway between a phone and a tablet in terms of size, but it's surprisingly light.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and display<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note has a 5.3" SuperAMOLED screen of WXGA (1280x800) resolution. That's 16:10 aspect ratio, which is close enough to the HD aspect (16:9) to fit videos just right but it's a bit wider, which comes in use when browsing the web.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>SuperAMOLED offers great contrast (theoretically infinite), saturated, lively colors and 180-degree viewing angles. It's not a 'Plus' model, which means it uses PenTile (2 subpixels instead of 3 per each pixel). But the very high pixel density - 285ppi - puts pixels so near the edge of human vision that you have to stare closely to barely make out the PenTile grid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For comparison, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 display has 196ppi, the Galaxy S II has 217ppi, HTC Sensation XE - 256ppi and the iPhone 4 offers 326ppi.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We took some close-up shots of the screen of the Galaxy Note along with the Galaxy S II and iPhone 4 to illustrate the difference. The photos are shot at the same magnification, so you get an idea of how the different pixel densities affects the amount of fine detail in the visible image.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can see the PenTile matrix of the Galaxy Note, but its pixels are closer in size to those of the iPhone 4 than those of the Galaxy S II so the "grid" look typical of PenTile is practically invisible on the Note's screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Plus, users will typically hold the bigger screen farther from their eyes, which increases the perceived pixel density further.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We mentioned that the theoretical contrast is infinite - that's because black pixels are completely switched off (that is, they give off zero light). In practice, reflections limit that to a finite number, but it's usually several thousands, well above any display that uses a backlight.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Samsung have gone through a lot of effort to make their SuperAMOLED technology as non-reflective as possible and they've done a pretty good job of it. Outdoor viewing is good, but there's another problem, brightness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 5.3" screen on our test Samsung Galaxy Note is rather dim. We don't have a retail version, so it might be a pre-production issue that will be fixed. This is probably the case, since we didn?t have this problem with the bigger, 7.7" SuperAMOLED on the Galaxy Tab 7.7.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We won't be doing brightness measurements this time around, we'll wait for the retail units to come out and include the results in our review.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The rest of the body<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note uses portrait orientation by default and packs practically the same set of controls as the Galaxy S II. This is a Gingerbread device, not Honeycomb like the Tab 7.7, so that's no surprise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Above the screen you have the proximity and ambient light sensors, along with the 2MP front-facing camera. On the other side of the screen is the hardware Home button plus the capacitive Menu and Back keys on its side.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's an earpiece on top and a mouthpiece at the bottom, so you can use the Galaxy Note as a phone. Holding it with one hand is not particularly comfortable but we'll get back to that in a minute.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the bottom, next to the mouthpiece is the standard microUSB port (hooray!), which leaves a quadruple life - it's a data and charging port, TV out port too (via MHL) and supports USB On-The-Go.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom is also where the S Pen lives, - that's what Samsung calls the active stylus of the Galaxy Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On top of the device, there's just the 3.5mm audio jack and another microphone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sides of the Samsung Galaxy Note are pretty barren - there's a volume rocker on the left and a Power/Lock key on the right and that's it. They are thin and barely protrude, so they're not the easiest buttons to press, but it's not a major problem either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We complete our hardware inspection at the back where we find the 8MP 1080p-video-capturing camera accompanied by an LED flash. The back also houses the single loudspeaker of the Galaxy Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We have the usual complaint here: the camera lens is not protected from scratches and fingerprint smudges and the loudspeaker gets muffled when you place the Note on a level surface. But most manufacturers seem to ignore such issues more often than not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The back cover is made of finely textured plastic (very similar to that of the Galaxy S II), which is nice to the touch and great at hiding fingerprints. You can see the back of the Note compared to the back of the Galaxy S II and how the two stack up size-wise.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Popping the back cover open reveals the 2,500 mAh battery. Samsung are mum on the battery time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also here is the SIM compartment, next to the microSD card slot, neither of which are hot-swappable as they're blocked by the battery. How Samsung could put the microSD card slot there on such a huge device is beyond us. They have more than enough room to put the slot in a more convenient location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note is a monster compared to regular phones - but then again, it's not exactly a phone. It's thin (9.7mm), light (you wouldn't guess it weighs 178g) and the rounded edges help ergonomics.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But still, one handed use is a problem - your thumb most likely can't reach every point on the screen (certainly not comfortably) and unless you have big hands, you can't easily wrap your fingers around the Note to hold it without fear of dropping. Two-hand thumb typing is absolutely spot on, however.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pocketability is an issue too - you can certainly slip in into your pocket (the thin frame helps a lot here), but a lot of people won't find that solution acceptable. Still, most coat pockets or purses will find enough room for the Galaxy Note, which is worth having around with all that screen real-estate.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>King-size interface<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note runs Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread with TouchWiz on top. Unsurprisingly, the interface looks a lot like that of the Galaxy S II only bigger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the video demo to get a better feel of the interface:</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The always-visible shortcuts at the bottom of the screen are now five (instead of four) and the main menu grid has been expanded to fit a 5x5 grid of icons (vs. 4x4 in the S II). It all makes sense: the extra space was there and they used it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other than that, the experience is the same as the phone-based TouchWiz. We won?t cover it in detail in this preview. We'll take a look at the S Pen related apps instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For preliminary performance benchmarks, you can check out our blogpost.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>S Planner and S Memo<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The regular TouchWiz Calendar gave way to the S Planner. It looks and behaves a lot like the vanilla app, but with some adjustments to accommodate the stylus and some general usability improvements.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The days of the month fit nicely on the huge screen and they are very easy to hit with the stylus. This will highlight the date and you'll see all events for that day in the scrollable area below.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The squares for each day are big enough to fit the first word of the title of up to two events. Subsequent events show up as "+1", "+2", etc. showing up in the upper right corner of the square.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When adding an event, you have three options: Quick add (just a quick text note), Add event (which lets you add anything from reminders and memo to photos and locations) and Add task, which handles your To-Do list (you can assign each task a priority, due date, group and so on).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Planner can seamlessly sync with multiple calendars.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Memo is very similar to the Memo app we're used to seeing in TouchWiz. The difference is that S Memo has extensive support for scribbling down notes and quick sketches using the S Pen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The app opens upon an empty canvas (with a square grid like notepaper) and lets you draw with the S Pen, enter text with the keyboard, add images (which can be scaled for fit) and voice notes .</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can choose between a pen, a brush, a pencil and a marker, each of which leaves a slightly different mark. You can adjust the thickness and the color. Other tools that might come in handy are the eraser, Undo and Redo buttons a Lock button to prevent accidental edits and the Favorite button to mark important notes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Memo app supports pinch zoom, so if you zoom in you have plenty of room to work with and then you can zoom out to get an overview. Panning around isn't very convenient as you have to manually enable pan mode and disable it after. Two finger panning or something would have been easier.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The S Memo lets you easily keep notes visible: you can put them on the homescreen as a widget, set them as lockscreen or homescreen wallpaper or even as a contact's photo to remind you next time you call (or get called by) that person.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Text input - handwriting or QWERTY<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>With the Samsung Galaxy Note you have two options for text entry ? the on-screen QWERTY and the handwriting recognition keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard method, QWERTY, is probably our favorite. The Galaxy Note is sized exactly right for holding it with two hands in portrait orientation and typing with both thumbs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If your hands are bigger, you can do the same in landscape. Either way, you're left with plenty of room for the text and the keys are big and very easy to hit. For speedy text input, this might be the fastest option available on the Note.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other option on the Galaxy Note is handwriting recognition using the S Pen. There's a "pen" icon on the QWERTY keyboard so you can quickly toggle that mode and the first time you start it, you'll be presented with the Gesture guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In some apps (e.g. the SMS composer) you can just start writing away on the text area. The word suggestions bellow will help you out at first while you get the hang of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Other apps (like S Memo) present you with a dedicated writing area at the bottom half of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's actually a third option - Swype - which comes preinstalled with the Samsung Galaxy Note. If you're used to Swype, there's a chance you'll be even faster on the big screen. You can enable Swype in the Settings.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Top-notch 8MP camera with FullHD video capture<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's no surprise that the Samsung Galaxy Note uses the same camera interface as the Galaxy S II - it probably uses the same camera module too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface is one of the most comfortable ones we?ve seen - the left column can be customized with your choice of shortcuts, while the right column holds the essentials (still/video switch, shutter key and preview of the last snapped photo).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Galaxy Note features a pretty full set of options - face, smile and blink detection, image stabilization, geo-tagging, scenes and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As for the image quality, it's very similar to that of the Galaxy S II but the software could use a bit more tuning (the Galaxy Note we're testing isn't a final retail unit). Still, noise levels are kept low and the amount of captured detail is very good.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We spotted some issues but we'll wait for the final version of the software before we pass our judgment. Still, the Samsung Galaxy Note is shaping up as one of the best 8MP cameraphones around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The videos captured with the Galaxy Note are equally impressive. The FullHD videos are shot at a bitrate of 17Mbps and that keeps a lot of fine detail in the shot, while providing smooth 30 frames per second.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Same goes for the 720p videos. The Note however retains some of the issues of the Galaxy S II. 1080p videos have much narrower field of view compared to 720p ones and there's the autofocus, which annoyingly hunts front and back in the first second of video (instead of doing it before it starts recording).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out the 1080p and 720p video samples we've uploaded to YouTube. Don't forget to chose 1080p and hit fullscreen.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Browser is a near tablet-like experience<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The two key determining factors for browsing are screen size and resolution and the Samsung Galaxy Note excels at both - with a screen like that, it will put in a lot of hours of web browsing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The UI follows the minimalist ethos of the vanilla Android browser but it has been slightly tweaked to make better use of the screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The URL bar at the top of the screen is flanked by the Back/Forward buttons on one side and the Tab and Bookmarks buttons on the other. Inside the URL bar itself are the RSS and Refresh buttons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It sounds like it's going to get cramped with all these buttons, but they're all big and easy to hit. The Menu key reveals more options and also makes the URL bar visible (it auto-hides once you start panning around the page).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Samsung Galaxy Note browser renders pages problem-free and it's very fast - panning, scrolling, zooming are very smooth.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In landscape mode, most pages fit the screen at 100%. 1280 pixels wide is about the size most web designs aim for. Of course, that makes text rather small, but you can always rely on text reflow, which reformats paragraphs of text to fit the screen better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One option we particularly liked is the dedicated screen brightness setting to use in the browser. That's independent from from the main setting but lets you toggle automatic brightness too. For example, you can keep the general brightness low to save battery but have the browser brightness at high for comfortable viewing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also tried out Flash and it was smooth sailing all the way. 1080p YouTube videos played smoothly, but you'd probably be using 720p most of the time since it fits pixel per pixel on the screen (with a black bar above and below since the Galaxy Note's screen is taller than 720p). Games also ran fine, so touch-optimized Flash games give you an alternative to games from the Market.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>First impressions<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We have to say our first impressions of the Samsung Galaxy Note are very positive. If you can get over the hurdle of figuring out how to carry the device comfortably, you're in for excellent performance, screen and camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We imagine both business types and power geeks will be interested in the Note and it has something to offer both groups. The easy note taking will appeal more to the suit and tie crowd. The blazing fast Exynos chipset will let power users enjoy every Android app, game and Flash site under the sun.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The hardware is pretty great too, provided the screen brightness isn't an issue in the retail units (and we think it won?t be). We would have enjoyed some metal on the body, but we're not sure we want to lose the feeling of lightness either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All this is really great and we have more stuff to look at in the review, but there's one thing that might make the Note a fairly rare device in the wild - price. It's not on sale yet, but the early prices being quoted don't look too good. By the sound of it, the Note is well in the vicinity of 7"-10" Android tablets (and even iPads).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As powerful as the Samsung Galaxy Note is, and as good a screen it has, it can't compete with the screen real estate of a big tablet. And it's not that much more pocketable than a 7" tablet either. It's still the kind of gadget that captures people's imagination. It's worth keeping an eye on. Perhaps not a device you think you'll need. But one you're going to want.</paragraph>
