			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>If you see someone having a chat on their wristwatch you may decide they've lost contact with the mothership. Well, it beats us what you'd think when the mothership calls back. But maybe this little personality test will help us figure it out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You find the idea of a video-call enabled wristwatch phone: a) Cool b) Fool-around cool c) Downright mental d) Man, not another Trekkie test! e) Who cares as long as we make some buck out of it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All right then, if you answered B, C or D it's pretty obvious you're not from LG. And hey, if you answered A, those who answered E will love to meet you.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Tick-tock, digital wristwatch phones are nothing new actually, but somehow we need to pull ourselves together and start taking them seriously. LG and Samsung do, so there must be something, right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD910 for one is dead serious judging by that price tag they have there. Or shall we call it LG double O seven - not so much for the cloak-and-dagger form factor as for the license to kill your savings. Well, it does make some sense really: almost acceptable dimensions and all the basic phone features duly covered. Touchscreen, fast data and video calling on a wristwatch - go ahead and call it crazy but you'd still be interested.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, let's check out that specs sheet then, shall we?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We bet some of those disadvantages you already knew, while the rest of them will receive their due explanation as the review unfolds. For now we'll just say we don't have a clue about the LG GD910 target audience so we're trying to cover up our embarrassment with lame jokes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, while hardly any self-respecting geek will wear one, the LG wristwatch can still count on the geek's benefit of the doubt. We sure hope we don't live to review ear implants as the next in mobile phones but we guess we can handle a wristwatch. Let's see what it's got (and what it doesn't).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>LG GD910 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>It's really strange that LG went for a regular letter-number designation for their first watchphone. We would have expected marketing to come up with at least something more easy to remember such as the LG Crystal.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD910 is too big for a watch but then, impressively small for a phone. Take the strap away and you have an LG touchscreen Mini-Me. Truth be told, if you fancy watches with larger dials you might find the LG GD910 size just fine. The really troublesome bit is its thickness really. We do however acknowledge the engineering achievement of squeezing in a capacitive touchscreen, 3G and video calls on top of the basic calling and texting stuff in that compact body.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps the future efforts will be in reducing the bulging girth. We haven't actually seen the Samsung S9110 in person but it sure looks quite thinner than the LG wristwatch. The The Samsung timepiece is no match for the LG specs though - it's some video-calls short of a childhood dream gadget (though maybe we didn't all grow up watching the same cartoons).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Anyway, back to the GD910, there's a fully-functional handset hiding inside and that's its main point, not the geeky charm or fashion value.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The leather strap is pretty nice and simple (at least on poor pre-release unit) but that charming simplicity hardly matches the fancy digital dials that appear on the screen. We're glad that for the final retail version LG went for a more mature strap enhanced with a metal clasp to secure the device on your wrist.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The watch dial is actually a 1.43" 256K-color capacitive touchscreen with a resolution of 128 x 160 pixels. Its image quality is rather disappointing but to be honest we hardly expected otherwise given the specs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The display size is rather limiting (especially for a touchscreen), which makes it quite a challenge to use comfortably at first, but we got used to it sooner than expected. Anyway, we guess it's a good balance in terms of comfort of use given the limitations of the form factor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only other things to note at the front are the earpiece and the VGA camera, which is used for video-calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The sunlight legibility was the first surprise of the GD910 screen. As one would expect from a watch it's perfectly visible in any lighting conditions, including bright sun. Also the capacitive technology used makes sure the display is pleasingly responsive.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next surprise however was unpleasant. It may be due to our unit being pre-release and all, but we've hardly seen so poor colors and contrast on a mobile screen lately.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The right side of the LG GD910 is where its hardware controls are placed - typical watch style. The GD910 has a Call key, which doubles as menu button in most menus, the Clear/Back button and the End key. They're comfortable enough to use but you have to account for some limitations across the interface.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For example in the music player the back key is used for setting the volume, so there is no actual back button functionality there. Pressing the middle key in the music player or during a call launches an onscreen volume control which you finger sweep up and down. It works quite alright even of the LG GD910's tiny screen.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The bottom side of the watch has a steel cover which you rotate to unlatch. We guess there might be some kind of tool for the purpose in the retail package but a coin will also do though you risk to scratch the groove walls.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The battery cover fits quite firmly so it needs a hard push to release but this was to be expected in a water-proof watchphone. Under the cover is the SIM card compartment and that's about that. We are sorry to break it to you but the swapping the battery is not a DIY option. There's no way to expand the built-in memory as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tour around the LG GD910 comes to a final stop at the metallic connectors at the bottom of the watchphone. To charge the battery you need to place the GD910 on the special cradle which takes in a proprietary LG charger or data cable. We guess a standard micro or miniUSB plug is too much to ask.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general build quality of the LG GD910 is probably the best thing about the whole device. With nice looking and seemingly durable materials it looks set to last.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now let's move on and check out what the GD910 has on the inside. It's a small piece but that probably makes the user interface all the more important.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Flash UI disappoints with speed<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The user interface of LG GD910 is based on Flash technology as past LG feature phone UIs and to tell you the thruth, it quite looks like them. It is of course stripped down to the bare minimum - there are only four icons remaining in its main menu, for instance. The design and organization however remain somewhat similar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, the novelty part is all about the watch homescreen. There is a number of different dials for you to pick from with some of them even capable of displaying two time zones at the same time. To toggle between the available dials, you simply flick up or down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A sweep to the left or right toggles the available the standby screens. The first of them shows information about the battery status, current profile and signal strength.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A tap on the profiles icon brings out a popup with the available profiles (all three of them). The choice is between the normal silent or outdoor profiles but the number of available settings for each is comparable to those of the regular LG featurephones. The icon next to the profiles indicates if there is any missed event, while the third one triggers the flight mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another sweep to the right displays the calendar for the current month. You can then press and hold the screen to enter the calendar app, without needing to go through the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next screen is the main menu, which consists of the grand total of four icons arranged in a neat 2x2 grid. Those take you to contacts, messaging, utilities and settings sub-menus which appear as scrollable lists. There phone can be quite laggy when you go in and out the sub-menus, but perhaps the final version will have that fixed.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>By default, the user interface comes in the black and white theme, resembling the one on the original LG Prada phone. There are also three alternative styles of the main menu which bring in more color and nicer icons.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final screen before returning again the watch dials is the video/voice call screen. It offers two shortcuts which allow you to initiate a video or voice call, bringing up the dial pad when one of them is selected.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Dialing numbers on the tiny screen can be a daunting task especially for men with large fingers. There is no Smart dialing, so you're left with the phonebook and its clumsy search interface to get in touch with your saved contacts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A key feature of the watchphone are the voice commands that it supports. You just need to hold the Back key until the handset prompts you to say the command. There are prerecorded speaker-independent commands for dialing a number, opening the message composer, checking the time and so on. Those also work when a Bluetooth handsfree is paired with the device to maximize their usefulness.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The general performance of the UI of the GD910 is hardly spectacular. Sacrifices had to be made so an entire handset can be sticked in such a small body and snappiness is one of them. It's not so bad that it's useless but the lagging get irritating at times.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A petit phonebook, but capable enough<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Contacts list of LG GD910 offers much the same function as any ordinary phonebook but in a more miniature version. There is room for up to 1000 contacts in the handset's memory. The phonebook allows storing extensive information on you contacts. You can organize your contacts into caller groups, and you can also assign them a picture and a ringtone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search a contact on the GD910 watchphone by gradual typing of the desired name but frankly said typing is not really our thing with this handset. We'd much rather use the scrolling instead, especially with shorter contact lists.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Editing a contact gives you a pretty large number of (extremely hard to fill in) fields. We'd gladly suggest however that you synchronize the GD910 with a PC and transfer them that way instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Still if you are really into it, you can complete the various fields such as mobiles, addresses, web-sites straight from the GD910 with the multitap onscreen keypad. If you fill in the birthday date the watchphone prompts you to add it to the calendar and does so automatically if permitted.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Telephony an arm's length away<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Now this is a particularly interesting chapter, given the LG GD910's peculiar form factor. If you are into talking to your wrist you can rest assured that the other party will be able to hear you nice and loud even if you don't hold the device too close. On the other hand the wristphone speakerphone is hardly loud enough so you will need a pretty quiet environment for perfect connection.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least voice quality is good and there are no interferences. So if you use the handset in the way it is meant to be - with a Bluetooth headset you will be just fine.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the negative side the aforementioned problem with the phonebook and its not entirely comfortable searching makes dialing a contact a harder task than we are used to.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The GD910 also offers vibration as a way of alerting you of incoming calls and messages much like any other mobile phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also put the little fella to our traditional loudspeaker test. Here is how it ranks along some of the other handsets in the same challenge. As you can see, it's a pretty poor performer, standing at the bottom of our table. Yet we cannot see you missing any calls with the vibrating GD910 on your wrist. You can find more information about the test itself and the whole list of tested devices here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Messaging is tricky<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Messaging may not be something you are going to use very often on the LG GD910 but it's there at least. It can handle only SMS, EMS but considering how hard typing is on the tiny screen even that seems too much.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The editor offers the basic looks of, say, LG KF510 and that's another thing we disliked. It has pretty basic functionality - there';s not even a character counter to show you how many symbols you have left to the 160 limit. At least there's an indicator showing you if the message needs to be sent in two or more pieces.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's neither MMS support, nor an email client so if you are into serious messaging (even only on the receiving end) you better look elsewhere. The GD910 will hardly pass as a capable messaging device and we guess it was never meant to be one. The bare minimum is covered for emergency situations but that's about that with it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Multimedia at the bare minimum<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Hardly a great multimedia device, the LG GD910 has the music player as its key asset in the department. It automatically sorts tracks artist, album and genre and allows users to create a playlist of their own if they like.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The player also has nice visualization with equalizer bars interacting with the current track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to the play/pause and the previous and next track onscreen keys the player also offers some extra functionality. There are shuffle and repeat features as well as five different equalizer presets that can be applied. Unluckily, neither can they be modified, nor new ones created.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The LG GD910 doesn't have a video player or an FM radio built-in so the only other multimedia app it offers is the picture gallery. It is extremely basic but it still offers move, copy and delete of both single and bulks of files.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can go though the gallery by sweeping the images vertically in fullscreen mode. There's no option for zooming, rotating or anything like that. Contact photos are the most the GD910 is supposed to handle.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Camera, kind of<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD910 has a VGA camera with a maximum image resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. Obviously its main purpose is video-calling but it can also snap the occasional contact photo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's a virtual shutter key and a single configurable setting - exposure compensation. As you might have noticed the camera is anything but a real photography tool so we aren't going to into too much detail with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It will snap a contact picture in good lighting conditions and that's about as good as it gets for it.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Enough connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The connectivity options of LG GD910 include the USB which plugs through the same adapter as the charger and Bluetooth v2.0. The USB modes available allow you to browse the phone's storage memory (Mass storage mode) or connect to the LG PC Suite desktop application (PC Suite mode).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's 3G connectivity on board as well but its functionality only stretches out to video-calling so we don't find it much of a connectivity asset.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In fact given that there's no web browser or any other feature that might require internet connection this branch of connectivity options is rendered useless anyway.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least the Bluetooth comes with A2DP support which allows a stereo headset to be connected. Don't bet on the LG GD910 replacing your dedicated music player though as the storage memory of the GD910 can't be expanded via a memory card.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Good organizer<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The LG GD910 has retained most of the organizer functionality of its bigger brothers. All the basics are covered and although the apps aren't the easiest to operate on the small display they are all there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calendar offers daily and monthly view and event setting. There are three different types of events (schedule, anniversary, birthday), each with its own set of fields. You can also set up an alarm to remind you of the event at a given time. There's also a to-do application to help you manage you upcoming tasks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other organizing features include text notes and an alarm clock. The LG GD910 alarm clock is rich in features.. It allows you to set up to 5 different alarms, each with its own name, ringtone and repeat interval. You can also assign a memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a voice recorder that can come in handy for making voice memos. Considering the difficult text-input, this would be our preferred method of making a memo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The calculator offers a good number of options and functions yet you need to go through several screens for even the simplest of calculations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The World Clock application is a nice little helper that can tell you the current time in any time zone. Finally, there's a stopwatch and a unit converter - they both feature a decent level of user-friendliness.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>All right then, we just tested a wristwatch phone. We walked around wearing it and no, we weren't beamed up to the mothership for some terrible experiments. No seriously, we showed it to some of our civilian friends and they were largely unimpressed. The mere mentioning of the price tag (starting at 900 euro with a contract at Orange France) managed to garner some respect for the LG watchphone but we kinda sensed the unspoken what-the-*bleep* attitude.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Whether you asked for it or not, the watchphone is here. Whether they did it just because they can or it fits some long-term plans, the LG GD910 will certainly get much publicity, at least for a while. It's probably the first watchphone to safely make it beyond the concept stage especially now that Orange announced they're already selling it. It's still even less than a niche product but will perhaps make more sales than all of its predecessors combined.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The price tag will sure drag it down though and so will the inevitable compromises of a new design. Not to mention the total lack of value for money. But who knows maybe enough people won't care they're getting 50 euro worth of phone features as long as they're getting 900 euro worth of class leading eccentricity.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If you're desperate to get a watchphone, the LG GD910 is pretty much the only option at the moment if we don't count the cheap Chinese Dual SIM solutions. LG are free to charge whatever they want for it anyway but it helps when people's purchasing judgment is clouded by the lack of competition. Well, the free ride is nearing its end as the Samsung S9110 is about to hit the shelves. And by the way, that means we need to be saving some wit for later.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung S9110</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So it goes, the LG GD910 is not the best phone and it sure would've helped if it looked a nicer watch. But it might turn to have potential. It's probably not too farfetched to even envision a sporty outdoor version - you know, taking your morning jog or weekend hike with your favorite music and without missing your calls. That sort of things and manufacturers can be quite creative really. After all there used to be pen phones well before there was Bluetooth, so we guess we might be seeing more wristwatch than we care to expect.</paragraph>
