		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Quietly brilliant is what HTC like to call themselves and they've been giving enough proof lately. But allow us to disagree. The last thing to call the HD2 is quiet - the monster of a PocketPC simply screams rock'n'roll.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We just got a glimpse of the Snapdragon-powered giant in the preview we posted a few days back. It's now time to let it off the leash and hope we can keep up with its speed. The HTC HD2, a.k.a. Leo, is the company's first Snapdragon-based device and also the first Windows Mobile smartphone ever to have a capacitive touchscreen (read: super thumb-friendly).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A capacitive touchscreen on a PocketPC? No way? Well, you'd better get used to it because they are just going to keep on coming. The HTC HD2 may be the first of its kind but the next ones are just around the corner. And what's even more important, a capacitive screen gives WinMo unmatched and absolutely unexpected user friendliness. With the large screen, icons are big, almost huge, and you can easily thumb your way around the menu and apps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've met the HD2 already and we guess it's ok to cut the civilities short. It's a device that likes to be in the thick of action and we're not paid to keep it idle either. The HD2 promises an exciting ride and it sure has horsepower to spare.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 may be a tad smaller than the monstrous Toshiba TG01 but that's nowhere near compact. And it all comes down to one simple thing: the 4.3" display. The huge touchscreen is an absolute treat but may be not that simple in the end. In tablet terms, the HD2 is sweet to use landscape but not every user will be happy with singlehanded operation and actual phone calls. But then you look at how thin it is, what it's packing inside and perhaps it doesn't seem so big. You know you'll adjust and get used to it in the same way that people got used to the less than compact size of the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And while we're at it, a side by side comparison of both devices may not be enough to convey the size issues of the HD2. In all fairness, a phone this size is not the most comfortable to hold next to your year but it's an impressive package that's worth the inconvenience. Against the iPhone, the HD2 has a much larger and higher-res touchscreen, as well as a faster processor, multi tasking and a 5 megapixel snapper with dual LED flash. HTC have also done a lot to transform TouchFLO into their new Sense UI, but it still lags slightly behind the user interface of the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One thing's for sure, the HTC HD2 is trying to widen the PocketPC horizon and remove the stigma of WinMo unfriendliness. We've seen very few phones that could possibly live up to the scale of that task. So, it's time to open the box and meet the handset in person. We're back after the jump with unboxing, design and construction. It's HD2 time.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Generous retail package<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC thought of everything when they put together the HD2 retail box. Along with the handset itself you get a USB wall charger, standard microUSB cable, software CD and a quick start guide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a one-piece headset with dedicated music controls; however, it sounds so bad you'd be wise to get rid of it and look for a proper replacement if you consider yourself an audiophile. Luckily, that headset isn't your only option since the HD2 is kind enough to offer a 3.5mm audio jack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Digging deeper you'll also find a 2GB microSD card and a stylish carrying pouch. While we're impressed by the pouch, we felt the enclosed memory card capacity was a little disappointing.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And here is a quick unboxing video of the HTC HD2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>HTC HD2 360-degree spin<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>A screen that big has its consequences. The HD2 measures in at 120.5 x 67 x 11 mm. The increase in the overall size of the phone has crossed some usability lines. We still find the HD2 reasonably easy to handle and the responsiveness and speed are remarkable. We're not sure which one will have you more impressed: the size or the sensitivity of the screen. The thin waistline does reasonably well to make the height and width of the handset a bit more acceptable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The weight of 157 grams is also understandable: the screen is covered by glass and the battery cover is all metal. Nevertheless, we don't consider the added weight a disadvantage. The phone feels very robust and well built.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 makes a better first impression than its predecessor - the HTC Touch HD. It's not that the differences are so big, but the thin frame combined with an even larger display and higher quality materials make for a pretty impressive combo.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new HD feels much more sophisticated - this is quite hard to achieve actually on such a big device. We still have to admit though that we liked the styling of the keys below the display better on the Touch HD.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The number of hardware controls on the HD2 body has been increased over its predecessor. There are five hardware keys below the display now. The Menu key is the newcomer - it's mandatory for all WinMo 6.5 devices (such as the Touch2 which we reviewed a week ago). Just as a comparison, the original Touch HD had only four keys (and they were all touch sensitive). The actual hardware buttons on the HD2 are smallish but well defined and with adequate press feedback.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The inconsistency between the HD2 regular hardware keys and the over-sensitive capacitive screen certainly needs a little time to get used to but it's not too bad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The left-hand side of the device hosts only a volume rocker. It is reasonably tactile and we have nothing to complain about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, there's no camera shutter key on the right side, just as there wasn't one on the Touch Diamond, Touch Diamond2 and the original Touch HD. The top of the HD2 is also bare.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Design and construction (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The bottom part of the phone hosts the microUSB port, the microphone pinhole and the 3.5mm standard audio jack. Understandably there's no stylus this time. This is the first phone by HTC to come equipped with a microUSB port as up until now they used the miniUSB variety.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At the back of the HTC HD2 is the 5 megapixel camera lens, stuck between the loudspeaker grill and the dual LED flash. It's a good thing that HTC decided to do something about low-light shooting this time by including a LED flash but we would have really preferred a dedicated camera key instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera lens sticks out a mile and we didn't quite like how your index finger somehow always landed on the lens. The lens protection also seems quite insufficient and if you carry your handset in the pocket, it would most definitely get scratched. A plus is the neat pouch we found in the retail package which should protect not only the camera lens but the screen as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Removing the steel back cover reveals the 1230 mAh battery (the predecessor came with a much more promising 1350 mAh battery). Here, you'll also find the reset pinhole along with the microSD card slot. The location of the card slot might not be good news to those of you that like using the card for transferring data. There is some good news though: the phone supports microSDHC cards and handled our reasonably full 16GB microSD card problem-free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Surprisingly, battery life turned out very good. Battery performance was better than the iPhone 3G, for instance, even though Apple's smartphone has a slower paced CPU. The HD2 managed to make it for 2.5 days with Wi-Fi constantly on, taking some pictures with the inbuilt camera and listening to music. So, if you turn the Wi-Fi on only when needed and don't talk too much, you can probably expect the device to stay alive for a good 2-3 days before recharge.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: We managed to make a dedicated real life battery test of the HTC HD2 and the results turned out better than expected given the highly clocked CPU and the large screen. The HTC HD2 stayed up and running for good 52 hours connected to 3G network with the following usage pattern:</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check more details about some other battery life tests we did with the HD2 in our GSMArena team blog.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD2 feels pretty solid. The steel battery cover and the fingerprint resistant plastic around it are certainly welcome additions.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In most cases, using the phone with only one hand shouldn't be a problem for you. However, reaching the corners of the display (when holding the phone with the right hand) might be difficult if not impossible without having to move the phone up or down.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, height poses problems for single-handed use and width is a bit uncomfortable in actual phone calls. These are inconveniences that cannot go unnoticed but we still believe the HD2 is well worth the extra effort. The capacitive screen and powerful CPU give the phone remarkable response and speed. Screen size makes browsing, viewing images and docs a pleasure.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The display comes from outer space<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nearly the whole front is taken up by the 4.3" monster display of the HTC HD2. Sporting WVGA resolution, the screen is the largest we have ever seen on a mobile phone (the two HTC Advantage devices don't exactly qualify as mobile phones here).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 is also the first in the WinMo family to use the capacitive technology, which takes precision and responsiveness to a higher level. A conventional stylus is no longer an option but on the large WVGA screen even the tiniest interface elements are easy to press with a finger.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We hardly have any complaints about sensitivity and what's more, the screen gives the impression that the OS is more responsive than on past devices. This might just be a subjective feeling of course, and we won't really know it before we see an implementation of the capacitive screen without the Snapdragon CPU.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the large size of the display easily exposes the display's 65K-color limitation. Color banding is easily visible on multiple screens throughout the interface and on some of the preinstalled wallpapers as well.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another downer is that legibility under direct sunlight is far from perfect. The display mirror finish and the fingerprint smudges make it really hard to discern what's on screen when you're out and about.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Sense meets TouchFLO 3D<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>PocketPC regulars are certainly familiar with the TouchFLO interface. With the HD2 however, HTC have decided to go to the next level and upgrade the old but still cool TouchFLO 3D with all heart-melting features found in the Sense UI pioneered on the HTC Hero. The result is a new Sense user interface resembling the tabbed TouchFLO with more content and full of eye-candy. The only thing missing as compared to the HTC Hero are the widgets, which you could freely move around the screen, but here you have tabs.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The huge capacitive screen of the HD2 is the first of its kind on a PocketPC and HTC have put quite some effort into delivering a whole new touch experience.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>All parts of the UI and the menus react promptly to your finger taps and sweeps without the need to apply any force to the screen. The transitions are fast and fluid, with nice animations. In fact, the capacitive screen, the Snapdragon CPU and the solid amount of RAM make this Windows Mobile 6.5 the fastest one around.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another first for Windows Mobile are the multi-touch gestures. You can use the pinch gesture to zoom in on photos, in the web browser and Google Maps, as well as in numerous other places where you may find the font size too small (such as the file manager tree view). There is no lag in zooming and it completely equals the iPhone zoom speed and smoothness. But that's understandable with the 1GHz Snapdragon inside.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We've prepared a video walk-through of the HTC Sense/TouchFLO 3D mixup.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new Sense Home screen offers a choice of full screen tabs, decked out with some impressive graphics. You can move through the tabs with a single finger sweep, or by scrolling the colorful thumbnail bar at the bottom of the screen until you hit the one you need. It's the familiar list from the TouchFLO 3D UI but with a few new additions. You get the homescreen (with a large clock and weather information and animations), favorite contacts, text messages, email, Internet, calendar, stock, photos and video, music, weather, twitter, footprints and settings.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Home tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now, let's have a closer look at those tabs. The Home tab gives you access to the revamped calendar, world clock and alarm. The familiar HTC clock still takes center stage, along with weather information.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have refreshed the Home tab by adding your home city weather info along with the same eye-candy animations as in Weather tab, so the weather can come alive on your handset. The other new addition to the Home tab is the shortcuts. You can assign nine quick links to almost any app or setting on your phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Home tab has its own context menu, where you can change the homescreen wallpaper - there are both animated and still backgrounds, but you can also opt for a weather wallpaper.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>People tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The second tab is People and it?s no news on HTC handsets. This time though there are minor changes in the look and performance. Here you can set shortcuts to your favorite contacts with an assigned image or, in the absence of that, a generic one provided by the software.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The nice thing is you can associate frequently used actions to each contact (call, text or email) and your choice will be visible on the contact?s thumb. While the previous versions of the HTC UIs used to set links to the selected contact?s details you can now call or text your favorite contacts with a single tap. We find the new approach more useful.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Messages tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Messages tab shows your latest SMS/MMS, and a single finger sweep will take you to your next message. A small shortcut in the top right corner will automatically start a new SMS/MMS with the default Windows message editor. The context keys will give you access to the Windows Mobile SMS/MMS inbox.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Email tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Email tab shows your emails as a nice looking stack of letters instead the old envelope style and, again, you can flip through them one by one.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The context keys give you access to the Windows Mobile Email inbox, as well as several commands such as Send/Receive or Email Account management.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Internet tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Internet tab launches the Opera 9.5 web browser . You can scroll down to your favorite bookmarks (maximum 10, displayed as thumbs) and launch a webpage directly from there.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first context key displays all bookmarks within the browser, while the second one lets you manage the Favorite bookmarks. It would?ve been nice to have a shortcut to the preinstalled RSS reader or the Streaming media player instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At least now there is an option to change the default web browser. In the Opera settings you may uncheck the relevant box and then the Internet Explorer 6 is automatically promoted as the default one, running directly from the Internet tab. We still prefer Opera, but on the HD2 we found that only Internet Explorer has full Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Calendar tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The next tab is the familiar and beautiful calendar. It's nicely touch-optimized and packed with functionality. You can change the month by sweeping your finger up or down, while selecting a particular day will open the appointment view.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>If your choice is a day from the next five upcoming days then you'll also get the weather forecast for it (of course that's available only if you set and updated the weather in the Weather tab).</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>HTC Sense meets TouchFLO 3D (continued)<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Stocks tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Continuing our path through the HTC Sense tabs we land at Stocks. The Stocks tab is another familiar part of the interface. There is only one context button for adding/editing/removing stocks you track.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Photos and Video tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Photos and Video tab is the same as before. It gives you access to your images and video files, which you can scroll with finger sweeps. Two additional shortcuts allow you to start the camera or camcorder directly from here. The context keys give you access to the Album application, which is used for viewing all your images and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a landscape mode, which is similar to the portrait style, but fits a lot more images.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Music tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Music tab has seen no changes either. It displays album art and the essential play/pause and skip buttons. The context keys let you access the music player options and the music player library where you can sort your music based on other filters besides album.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is an alternative landscape view (auto-rotation enabled), where you can flip between the albums' covers in the iPhone?s Cover Flow style.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Weather tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Weather tab still amazes with its beautiful graphics. You can check the weather in up to 7 locations and you can flip through them with a finger sweep. You can also get a 5-day forecast for these locations via the first context key. The second context key allows you to manage the locations for which weather data will be retrieved.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Bear in mind that your default location which is determined when you first start the handset can't be changed afterwards. In fact, it's the untouchable eighth city that will always be present there ? go figure.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Twitter and Footprints tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The two new tabs are Twitter and Footprints. Neither neeeds special introduction, as both Twitter and the HTC Footprints service have been around for quite some time. Footprints are geotagged photos stored with additional information such as a note, a name, a phone number, or a website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The only way HTC offer image geotagging is through Footprints. The geotagging feature is not present in the camera yet again. To tag a photo with an exact location, you need to do two things: choose a square crop of the image (not the entire photo) and then wait for GPS signal, because basic celltower triangulation cannot be used in Footprints. Of course there is another option - to choose the exact place on the map manually.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Settings tab</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final tab is Settings and it lets you control various system options and replaces the old and confusing Windows Mobile Settings page. The Settings tab is changed since the Diamond 2 and now has even more options. All of the previous entries are here, some of them with changed names. The new options include Location services, Security, Applications, SD card and storage, Date &amp; Time, Locale &amp; text, Updates and Other.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Alternatively, you can access the standard WinMo settings by tapping on the All Settings key, but that?s hardly our preferred course of action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The old Wallpaper setting is now called Personalize and packs the Customize tabs too. Sound &amp; Display is expanded with backlighting and accelerometer preferences.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here you can find the on/off switch for the new Pocket mode - upon an incoming call, the phone automatically recognizes that you're carrying it in your pocket or purse and sets its maximum ringing volume so you won't miss the call. Neat indeed! It's not ground breaking functionality, but it's those little things (such as the HTC Touch Diamond magnetic active stylus) that really put the now late HTC Innovation slogan in real context. When it comes to this ingenious volume control, it?s good they didn?t stay with the ?Quietly brilliant? slogan. Just kidding, of course.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In addition to this Pocket mode, you also have Quiet ring on pickup. This does exactly what the name suggests - if your phone is ringing, the moment you pick it up from the desk it turns down the ring volume considerably. Another nice feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Next up Wireless controls is the new name for the Communication manager, while the Data Services packs all kind of accounts and data sync options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The new System status screen is also here. When you touch the icons on the top of the Home screen, you'll bring up the notifications area where you can check missed events, operator messages, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections, battery life and more.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other way to view various notifications such as missed calls, new messages or emails, or even today's appointments is through the lockscreen. At the bottom near the clock you will find your appointments, while just below the unlock button you can see various event reminders such as missed calls or what-not.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 is the second PocketPC we've reviewed powered by the Snapdragon 1GHz CPU, and we ran the SPB Benchmark again - this time head to head with the Acer neoTouch. As you can see for yourself, the performance is similar. But as you will see later, the HD2 will do worse in the HD video test.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Windows Mobile 6.5 underneath the Sense<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Pressing the Start button on the HD2 opens something similar to the menus found in non-smartphones. In the new main menu you've got all the installed programs plus shortcuts to the settings menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And of course, as of Windows Mobile 6.5 this Start menu comes in a honeycomb pattern, which is supposed to make touch control even more comfortable.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The perfectly flat structure of the Start menu can surely get a bit clumsy in time due to the huge number of icons piling up, but still we'd prefer that over the confusing experience that so many Widows Mobile new adopters have had in the past.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Icons within the main menu are easy to rearrange: a press and hold is enough to move the frequently used icons to the top.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Without a doubt, Windows Mobile 6.5 is the user-friendliest WinMo ever made. Unfortunately the improvements over its predecessor 6.1 aren't big enough to make it able to compete with the other contemporary platforms in terms of usability. Of course there is some touch optimization but the truth is a complete overhaul is needed rather than just the facelift it got.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We?re glad HTC have gone the extra length of skinning all the context Windows menus as well throughout the whole UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We recently published a dedicated article on the new Windows Mobile 6.5. Feel free to take a closer look and see how far WinMo has gone.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The best contact manager to date<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Contact management is usually considered one of the strongest points of Windows Mobile. You have an unlimited contact list, unlimited info fields for each contact and brilliant synchronization options.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Since the Diamond2, HTC have added a new interface which uses a small thumb icon for a person's picture, set against a gray background with nice font. You can scroll alphabetically using the letter column placed on the right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can search contacts by gradual typing of any of the names and you can find the dedicated search button in the upper right corner.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The standard editing options are just great, but unfortunately advanced editing of contacts throws you back into the old WinMo depths. We find all the given options into the HTC interface pretty enough, so we can hardly imagine anyone digging in there. But hey, you still have a plethora of available info fields - and if by any rare chance those are not enough, you can always rename some of the existing ones and use them instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Viewing a contact is a whole new experience. We find the HTC implementation of the contacts interface the best among smartphones and with the new additions in the HD2 it just has no competition.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First of all it's very stylish and visually attractive. The contact's information is neatly divided into categories - name, actions and information. There are five icons on a shortcut taskbar at the bottom - details, messaging, all emails, events and call history. You can scroll between the different tabs the same way you do it with the tabbed homescreens - by dragging a finger over the shortcut bar or by onscreen sweeps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can compose a SMS/MMS directly from the message tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Events tab is the new one and it's about social networking. You can associate every contact with its Facebook profile. If you do that, the HD2 will automatically set birthday and download the contact?s profile picture and use it for contact photo (regardless of whether you have previously assigned one or not). Consequently, in the events tab you can see the new Facebook profile updates of the particular person and in the contact list their mood message will appear just under their name.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The other extra you receive with the Facebook link is the additional Online Album key in the General Information tab. It gives you full access to Facebook albums using the revamped HTC Albums gallery.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We really love the new phonebook and have never seen so much functionality so neatly organized and user-friendly. Good job, HTC.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a video demonstrating the contacts app in action.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Excellent call management, but you already knew that<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Making calls is always a priority for any phone - that still holds true for PocketPCs such as the HD2. And like most other recent HTC handsets, this one keeps the high standard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Phone application offers Smart dialing, so you hardly ever need to go to the Contacts list in order to dial a number.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in accelerometer gives the HTC HD2 a familiar cool feature: you can mute the ringer by simply turning the phone face down on the table. If you turn the handset back up, the ringing won't resume by itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Don't worry, it's unlikely your calls will get muted accidentally in your pocket - the feature is set up in such a way that it's more likely to not engage at all rather than engage for no particular reason.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>One point of note though is that if the HD2 is already face down when a call comes in, the feature won't be available.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD2 did quite well in our loudness test. It snatched a Very Good mark and here is how it stacks up against some other handsets we've tested. More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>More info on our test can be found here.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Great messaging<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 supports SMS, MMS and email. SMS and MMS share an inbox and a message editor and thanks to Sense UI, you can enjoy thumb scrolling in the inboxes and in longer messages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Message tab offers a great interface for managing messages. With the nice interface and touch-optimization it's highly unlikely you will ever switch back to the standard Windows SMS inbox. Threaded SMS is also available on the HD2, just as it is across all Windows 6.5 devices.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The email inbox is also available as a homescreen tab with eye-catching styling. The email editor will hold no surprises for experienced WinMo users as it hasn?t changed at all.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Setting up your email is easy as it is on most of the latest mid or high range phones. You type your email and password and all the other fiddly options are configured automatically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Perhaps now is a good time to mention input options on the HD2. Since the device lacks any form of keypad you get a set of home-grown thumbable virtual keyboards. The first one is a regular numpad, the other is a brand new and huge full QWERTY keyboard and the last option is a regular WinMo QWERTY optimized for stylus use. As you can guess, using a regular stylus on the capacitive touchscreen is out of the question, so we hope that?s the last time we see that keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another disadvantage ? if you can call it that ? of the capacitive HD2 screen is the lack of handwriting recognition. To us it?s not a big deal, especially given the absolutely fabulous screen sensitivity and large virtual keyboard. But some users who would be upgrading from previous PocketPCs might want to consider this.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The full QWERTY is available both in portrait and in landscape mode and thanks to the huge screen it might turn to be the best virtual keyboard out there. To view the landscape one you just need to rotate the HD2 in that position.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>File management is easy<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 offers a small amount of user available storage - about 180MB. This is barely sufficient and you'll definitely find yourself needing a microSD card. It?s good that there is a 2GB in the retail package.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The file manager is the standard Windows Mobile one and won't surprise anyone. Interestingly enough pinch zooming works here in case you have issues with small fonts.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

	<page>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The image gallery does multi-touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HD2 offers a nice thumbnail browser straight from the Photos and Videos tab on the Home screen and we already saw it in the UI section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There's another thumbnail browser in the Album app available from the context menu on the Home screen or from the Programs menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The image is opened automatically in landscape mode and there is no option to rotate it to portrait view. Still that's not a bad thing because it means the photos you take with the camera are always properly displayed fullscreen. Once the image is opened, you can zoom in or out using the pinch gesture or the double tab, or continue to the previous/next by finger sweeps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As we mentioned before, zooming easily rivals ? and perhaps outdoes ? the iPhone, considering the HD2 is handling 5 megapixel photos.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Now here's a demo of how the music player and image gallery look like in action. That video is really full of eye-candy. Good job, HTC!</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Music player iPod-style<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Just like recent HTC PocketPCs, the HD2 has a good music player that makes excellent use of Album art. The music player is accessible straight from the Sense home screen with a cool Apple-like Cover Flow animation for you to pick an album from.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Like the gallery, the music player also features a fancy landscape view. It copies the iPhone Cover Flow again and will allow you to scroll all albums. If you select an album, a semi-transparent track list will appear on the right and you can view and play the songs from it. There are also dedicated music controls at the bottom bar.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In case you want to filter tracks by other criteria beside album, the Library shortcut will take you to the player backend where you can sort music by artist, genre, composer, purchased tracks or simply create custom playlists. The visual interface of the library is fluid and eerily reminiscent of iPhone's very own music player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Equalizer presets are available only when you have the headset plugged in. They are not part of the music player itself but of a separate application called Audio Booster. That setup allows you to make use of the presets when you watch videos or even when you listen to music on an alternative player.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the 3.5 mm audio jack you can plug your favorite headset in and worry not about the bundled headphones.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The FM radio does the job perfectly<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HD2 built-in FM radio naturally requires the headset to be plugged-in. It has an excellent interface much like the rest of the multimedia players on board and offers memory for some 20 radio stations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>RDS is available too - so overall, radio is handled pretty well on the HD2.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Audio quality<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The audio quality of HTC HD2 is pretty good, save for the disturbingly high intermodulation distortion levels. The handset fared excellently in almost all other parts of our test achieving some pretty impressive scores.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The frequency response is good for most of the interval, the cut-off extreme treble being the only flaw. For the rest of the range it remains within 0.39 dB of the perfect straight line.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The noise level, dynamic range and stereo crosstalk readings are great, comparable to the best in class. Here go the results so you can compare it to some of the other handsets we have tested.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Video player is not impressive<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HD2 comes with the standard - and sadly underperforming - Windows Media Player. It only manages mp4 and 3gp and for DivX/XviD support you will need a third party application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC have also added their own video player but it only supports the video/audio codecs available to Windows Media player in the first place. To enjoy a wider range of video options on the HD2 (DiVX or XViD for example), you will probably need to purchase a dedicated video player with additional codec support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We tried the well-known Core player and as usual it did a great job. Unfortunately watching HD videos is still a no-go. Still pretty much all videos under 720p played just fine without any dropped frames. The HTC HD2 has similar issues as Acer neoTouch and even worse performance. While the neoTouch managed to play the 720p videos with 15-17 fps, the HD2 has an output of only 12-13 frames per second. Not that any of those means a watchable video but it gives you an idea. We guess the graphics subsystem of the Acer neoTouch has a few tricks under its sleeve and it's not a matter of pure CPU clock comparison.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We made out traditional Core Player benchmarks with the HTC HD2 along and compared them with the Acer neoTouch. As you can see from the screenshots the duo performed very well with the standard videos and the results are almost equal.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>As you might have guessed, videos looked excellent on the HD2 WVGA display.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Several days later, we are finally able to get back with some battery life tests among which is the dedicated video playback. The HD2 managed to put up some good 4 h 30 min non-stop video playback in Flight mode. Given the power-hungry hardware the HD2 exceeded our initial expectations.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can check more details about some other battery life tests we did with the HD2 in our GSMArena team blog.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>Midrange camera in every aspect<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 has a 5 megapixel auto focus camera producing photos with a maximum resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels. The camera offers an intuitive user interface and shoots in landscape mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Guess what? It lacks a dedicated camera key AGAIN, but autofocus is handled the iPhone way this time. It's automatic and refocuses whenever you move the device. Once focus is locked, you can take the picture by pressing the virtual capture button. There is touch-focus too, but you need to enable it in the settings first.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD2 packs dual-LED flash, but as it won't make a great difference in low-light conditions or in pitch-dark places. Still you can use it as a video light, but again it won't be much of a help.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Interface and features</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD2 viewfinder is free of any overlaying controls by default but you can display those by touching the dedicated key under the "capture" button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>In terms of camera features, the HTC HD2 has the usual and offers the standard self-timer, white balance presets, ISO settings (up to ISO800), color effects and a viewfinder gridline.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably among the strangest of things, the HD2 camera lacks geotagging, and it's beyond us why they left that out. As we mentioned before, the Footprints may be some excuse, but still not enough by our books. And it?s not just HD2, almost all previous high-end HTC smartphones lacked that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the HD2 you can shoot macro images easily without the need to change modes. However focusing on close-ups is rather hard and is somewhat of a hit-or-miss - sometimes the HD2 will focus correctly, while other times it's way off.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Image quality</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The picture quality is good with enough resolved detail and natural colors. On many of the images we noticed an abnormal pink tint to the whites dead center ? just like a spot. It?s it?s more visible at thumbnail size and it?s certainly a flaw of the camera but we?re not really sure if it?s a unit-specific issue (ours is a retail handset off the store shelf, not some pre-production unit). There is a bit of over sharpening too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The biggest camera problem comes with the yellow scenes. As you can see for yourself from the samples bellow, the HD2 camera just can't handle the yellow color right.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Synthetic resolution</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also snapped our resolution chart with the HTC HD2. You can check out what that test is all about here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As you can see from the resolution chart, the resolved detail is not as much as we hoped but the resolution is enough for a 5 megapixel snapper. Still there are some obvious issues concerning the center spot where you can notice the pink tint, we told you about.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Poor video recording</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD2 video capturing capabilities are ok, but not that impressive - VGA recording at 30 fps. Given the video capabilities of many modern phones and bearing in mind the powerful HD2 1GHz CPU, we really expected more (HD for example). The video quality is almost decent but the compression is harsh at times - the videos should really be better.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The interface of the camcorder resembles that of the still camera. You can only adjust the white balance, resolution, brightness and finally add some color effects.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here is a sample VGA video captured by the HD2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>All-in-one connectivity<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>When it comes to connectivity the HTC HD2 has it all - HSDPA 7.2Mbps, HSUPA 2Mbps, Wi-Fi, stereo Bluetooth + EDR. It hasn't added 802.11n but that is still in the drafting stages.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD2 has quad-band GSM support and dual-band 3G - 900 and 2100 MHz bands are supported (that is Europe and the like). You can check out our Worldwide GSM Network Bands distribution database.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>USB 2.0 connections are supported as well, but for the first time through a microUSB port. When connected to a computer, the HD2 prompts you to select among ActiveSync, Mass Storage or Modem mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 3.5mm audio jack for the audio purists is also onboard.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Web browsers at war - Opera lacks Flash, IE lacks multi-touch<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 comes with the latest Opera browser. There's also IE Mobile 6 and strangely the choice between the two is not so obvious anymore with only IE having Flash support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Opera browser is extensively touch-optimized and supports multi-touch. On that big capacitive screen along with the powerful hardware, the web browsing experience on the HD2 is almost unmatched.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Pages load quickly and look very good on the big screen, the pinch zoom is smooth and very fast with no visible lag. Scrolling up and down the page is also extremely fast and fluid.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Unfortunately, the Opera does not support Flash, so you can't view Flash content and videos. Internet Explorer on the other hand is supposed to handle Flash flawlessly, but watching Flash videos is still troublesome. Embedded YouTube videos in websites play very well, but you can't open the desktop YouTube without the help of direct video link. The IE always opens the mobile version and there is no link to the original one. It's just odd. IE can't handle the contents on Vimeo or some other Flash video sites either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Of course, there is HTC YouTube client preinstalled, so watching streaming videos from the mobile YouTube version is trouble free.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As far as the Internet Explorer interface is concerned, it somehow resembles the Opera one, auto hiding context buttons at the bottom of the screen. There are five available settings for text size and there is a mobile view mode. Still, on a high-res screen we are far more comfortable using the desktop mode, as web pages look much more natural.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Compared to the Opera, IE Mobile has two major flaws - there is no multi-touch support and it seems to load web pages twice as slow. Choosing between the two web browsers and their respective downsides will definitely be a matter of personal preference. We know we would go for Opera any time. Anyway, users want to have a choice and that?s what the HD2 is ready to provide.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>here's a video we shot demoing how the two web browsers work on the HTC HD2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>The organizer we like the most<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Windows Mobile offers several time-management features and all of them are easily syncable with Outlook. In the HD2 the standard interface is kept under wraps - the only times you catch a glimpse of it are when creating or viewing an appointment. The homescreen only shows the basics - time and subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Calendar offers daily, weekly, monthly and even yearly views. All of them are available in the Sense UI, so you will never go again to the white WinMo interface. The left context key allows you to switch only between the monthly and daily view. For the others you will need to go to the menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Adding an appointment is easy and you can do it by the dedicated button. It has plenty of fields, reminders and notes. The time settings resemble the iPhone clock wheels, which LG already adopted in their S-Class UI.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>When viewing tasks, you can also see weather information for that particular day if available. The Sense UI preloads the weather forecast for up to 5 days ahead of the last update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The To-Do list allows you to add tasks and assign them priority; the Notes also come in handy. The Voice recorder and Calculator need no explanation.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Alarm clock has three alarm slots. Each Alarm can have its own repeat pattern. Unfortunately, due to the limited customization options in the default Alarms application, we suggest you check out some of the free third-party alternatives.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection>
			<subsectionTitle>A document editor is readily available<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Among the other WM core applications is the Office Mobile package featuring support for viewing and editing Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files. With the latest version of Office Mobile, you also have the OneNote application.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Once again, the WVGA display of the HD2 proves superior in fitting as much of the documents contents on the screen as possible - especially in portrait mode.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to Adobe Reader LE, there is also support for viewing PDF documents. We are pleased with the performance of the HD2 in this area, as opening and handling PDF documents is usually rather slow on handhelds.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Apps and stuff<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 comes with plenty of preloaded applications - an RSS Reader, MP3 Trimmer, HTC Peep, Facebook, Bing, Wi-Fi Router, World Card Mobile, Jetcet Print, a YouTube application and a Streaming Media manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The RSS Hub app is an RSS reader for staying up-to-date with the latest news and content at your favorite web places. The Streaming Media manager allows access to custom sources of streaming audio and video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Facebook and Peep are the official mobile apps for accessing the popular social networks of Facebook and Twitter. You can do almost everything with them - change status, write posts, upload photos or organize albums, stay connected to your friends and all that stuff. As we mentioned before, there is complete Facebook integration with the new phonebook. When you link a Facebook profile to a contact you can view its status message, updates and online albums directly in the Contact manager.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC Peep works directly in the Twitter tab, so you won't need to run it from the Start menu.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Wi-Fi router allows you to share your HSPA connection to other Wi-Fi enabled devices such as a mobile computer, while the Jetcet Print will let you to print documents wirelessly directly from your HD2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>WorldCard Mobile is a business card scanner. You can capture cards, and then edit or save them.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>HTC HD2 also ships with the MP3 Trimmer app. It allows you to crop MP3 tracks to make your own ringtones. Another goodie is the Remote Desktop Mobile client. It allows you to connect remotely to any Windows-based computer.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another thing that has become a part of the HTC experience is the well-known Teeter game. The game is simple - by tilting the phone, you must guide a ball through various mazes avoiding trap holes along the way. The graphics are polished and the phone vibrates each time your ball hits the walls of the maze making it quite engaging to play.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The YouTube application is here again. It offers a fluid, excellent looking interface - shinier than even the iPhone's.</paragraph>
		</subsection>

			<subsectionTitle>Embedded GPS, CoPilot Live 8 on trial<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 features a built-in GPS receiver. It also supports the Assisted-GPS technology, commonly known as A-GPS. It means you can download current satellite data over Wi-Fi or the 2G/3G network for a much faster satellite lock.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HD2 comes with a trial version of CoPilot Live 8 and the free Google Maps. The 4.3" touchscreen of the HD2 is a serious threat to dedicated GPS units. Anyway, you have 14 days to test the CoPilot Live and decide if the HD2 can do the full-time job of in-car SatNav unit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The good thing about CoPilot Live 8 is that it allows you to download the whole map for your region so you don't need to download it over the wireless network on the go. The bad thing is that the software won't allow downloading to the memory card so all the storage you have available fits within the 180MB worth of free space storage on the system partition. Sadly, that won't take you too far - both geographically and metaphorically.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The chip sensitivity of the HTC HD2 seems to be quite decent for a reasonably fast initial satellite lock. Both CoPilot 8 and Google Maps have multi-touch support, while the double tap works only in the GMaps.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The built-in digital compass enhances the digital map experience even further. The compass works in CoPilot, but not in GMaps. Still it's more important for the navigation software and we think there will soon be an update to give the Google app compass support.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update 11 Dec: The latest Google Maps 3.3.1 adds the awaited compass support. Well, sort of. Instead of an auto rotating map, you get a blue arrow (replacing the standard ?My location? dot) hopefully showing accurately which way you're heading at the moment. We really hope they would add the map rotation feature ala Android or iPhone soon.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Check out how pinch zooming works in Google Maps on the HTC HD2.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Tweaks &amp; Modding<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>And just a step away from the conclusion we'll share with you some tips about tweaks and modding. PocketPCs have long been the target of custom modding, patching and tweaking. HTC for one have an especially wide and busy fan base that seems to be constantly poking and prodding for a new twist to their gear.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So, the HTC HD2 review would not be complete without mentioning some of the achievements on the user customization and modding scene.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>First off, it's the screen auto rotation limitations that have become the target of the modders. By default, screen auto rotation only works in the web browser (not even in the image gallery and the video player).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Gyrator app enables the automatic screen rotation for the HD2 almost all across the interface - except for the Home screen. An added bonus is that you can set specific system or app events to be triggered in response to the handset movement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>At this point, Gyrator didn't work for enabling auto rotation in the gallery, but we guess a newer version should be out soon taking a specific approach to HD2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>You can find more about Gyrator and download the latest version over at its developer's website.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>There is also a whole list of other customizable options that require you to edit the Windows Mobile system registry.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Probably the most useful feature you can enable that way is the pinch zooming across newly installed applications (notice that this won't work with preinstalled programs like Internet Explorer). Pinch zooming is a must have feature when it comes to small-font applications like the Registry Editor, which are better suited to stylus use than anything else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Zooomer app turned out the most convenient way to enable pinch zooming. You only have to find the installed application in the custom created list, check a box and soft reset your device. It works like a charm. You can download the Zooomer app here (it's at the bottom of the page).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And when it comes to the Registry Editor, we used it to activate the geo-tagging feature of the camera. It allows saving the location information in the EXIF file of the image. It is very strange why HTC decided to deactivate this feature even if the hardware and the software support it. Just start the Registry Editor, go to HKLM\Software\HTC\Camera\P10 and set Enable to 1. Then soft reset the device and start the camera to see the GPS Photo among the other capture modes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the Registry Editor we were able to unveil part of HD2's hidden potential. For example, we enabled the Wi-Fi 802.11n support which increases Internet browsing speed dramatically. You need to go to HKLM\Comm\BCMSDDHD1\Parms and to change 11nModeDisable from 1 to 0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The haptic feedback for link clicking in the Opera browser was something else that we had to enable on our own. If you'd like to do it as well, just go to HKLM\Software\Opera\Defaults, then tap and hold on the white background, create a new DWord value called VibrationEnabled and set (dec.) to 1.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Normally, links in Opera work only when you?ve zoomed in on them, however, using the Registry Editor you can enable clickable links in zoom out. Go to HKLM\Software\Opera\Info\az_overview_threshold and change the value from 64 to 32.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The last trick made possible by the Registry Editor is the magnifying box, which appears when a text is selected. After changing the value from 0 to 1 in \HKLM\Software\HTC\TextSelection\EnableMagnifier, you can go to the Messaging app and try this feature out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The HTC HD2 doesn?t have voice dialing app out of the box but you've got numerous options out there. For instance, you can get the Cyberon Voice Speed Dial application, which when assigned to a button can handle voice dialing and even execute voice commands.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The tweaks we mentioned work like a charm and are generally easy to do, however, believe it or not, there is an even easier way to enable all those hidden features. The application that will do all the heavy lifting for you is called BsB Tweaks. Thanks to it you only have to switch on or off a certain feature.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>And finally, you can also download a user customized system image (or ROM, as its more popular). Most of those are created to easily transfer numerous system tweaks in one go that hopefully improve overall performance and fine tune certain aspects of the OS and UI. For further details visit the XDA developers' forum and look for the Leo section.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>As always, use caution and sound judgment when tweaking your phone's system files. Some of those actions can void your warranty and even brick your device if you don't know what you're doing. We don't accept any liability for any damage you may cause to your phone by engaging in these officially unauthorized system tweaks.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Final words<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>HTC HD2 has it all to be a winner ? groundbreaking hardware, inventive software, high performance and solid design. HTC have struck the right balance with the HD2 and they are certainly giving the competition a run for their money.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Thanks to the capacitive screen the HTC Sense delivers almost unsurpassed Windows Mobile experience complete with multi-touch gestures. It seems the Snapdragon platform is what the now aged Windows Mobile platform was meant to run on. If only we had that kind of hardware and software a couple of years ago, nobody would have even considered the iPhone seriously.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But we didn?t and we don?t suppose Snapdragons are going to become mainstream any time soon. So from a broader perspective, Windows Mobile is still just another runner-up in the run for the ultimate all-touch smartphone. The impressive user-experience on the HD2 is hardly indicative for the OS by itself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So if you get our drift, it's not Microsoft, but HTC that deserves the user experience award for the HTC HD2. Their Sense UI and TouchFLO 3D have blended exquisitely well delivering an unmatched social networking integration (save perhaps for the HTC Hero) and touch experience easily equaling that of the iPhone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But even though it?s such a powerful package, the HD2 has it flaws too. The camera is below par, video recording is kinda poor, the limited internal storage is a real bugger and the its sheer size does push the limits of user comfort. That last thing will perhaps be a deal breaker for many users.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>What is more, the HD2, just like its predecessor, does not justify its HD moniker. It doesn?t capture HD videos (but we knew that beforehand) and worse yet, it cannot even play any right. Samsung Omnia HD does these things with a substantially lower clocked CPU, so we guess Snapdragon doesn't equal HD automatically either.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But still Snapdragons are still quite rare on the phone market and until more of those appear next year, the Toshiba TG01 and the Acer neoTouch will always remain two opponents the HD2 should consider. Both of them feature less UI customizations, resistive touchscreens and less RAM. But what works in their favor is they both are nearly 200 euro cheaper than the HD2 with its 550 euro price tag. That alone makes them worth checking out. But as we said, HTC have done a tremendous job of making Windows Mobile more usable and the added value of their product is well worth the extra bucks.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>  Toshiba TG01 ? Acer neoTouch</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The final threat for the HD2 success on the Windows Mobile ring is the more lightweight Samsung I8000 Omnia II, which should definitely be the weapon of choice for all those of you that find the HD2 just too big.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It might not have the brute processing power of the HD2, nor the RAM count, but the actual handling and response are perfect. The 3.7" AMOLED screen, another fully customized UI, huge internal storage, DivX/XviD support out of the box and all kind of software goodies make the I8000 Omnia II a force to be reckoned with in the smartphone field this holiday season. Not to mention it?s got a nicely capable camera and it currently goes for some 150 euro less than the HTC HD2.</paragraph>
			<paragraph> Samsung I8000 Omnia II</paragraph>
			<paragraph>So there you go. There is no shortage of options out there but we?ll gladly take the HD2 just as it is. On some counts it would be a decision against good reason, we admit, but the passion for gadgets is rarely one of logic, and always one of the heart.</paragraph>
