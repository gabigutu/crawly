			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia kicked off the event by announcing a software boost for all Windows Phones, including the Lumia Camera, before bringing out the tangible goods in the Nokia Lumia 830 and Lumia 730. Both are midrange smartphones, the 830 touted as "the first affordable flagship".</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 830 is the thinnest and lightest Lumia, says Nokia, including the thinnest Optical Image Stabilization module - it's slim enough to allow overall depth of just 8.5mm. The camera itself boasts Zeiss optics and a 10MP sensor.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 730 slots in just below the 830 and puts a special spin on the front camera (the rear camera is interesting too). Nokia has developed a dedicated Lumia Selfie app that works best with the 5MP wide-angle camera on the face of the Lumia 730 but will also be available for all Lumias.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 730 is a 3G dual-SIM device but a Lumia 735 version will offer 4G LTE connectivity. The Lumia 830 has LTE by default, all three new models will ship this month.</paragraph>
			<paragraph></paragraph>
			<paragraph>Both phones will ship with the new Lumia Denim release responsible for a lot of improvements to the software. This includes the new Lumia Camera and the Selfie Camera apps. The Lumia Camera app enables 2160p video recording and creative new ways to edit photos after the fact - including choosing whether the flash is enabled or not!</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia also unveiled a couple of new accessories - a notification-centric wireless charging plate and a Windows Phone alternative to the Chromecast.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 830 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 830 is what Nokia calls "the first affordable flagship." Its most impressive feat is that it packs an Optical Image Stabilization yet in a body barely 8.5mm thick. It's the thinnest OIS system yet, an impressive achievement.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It's certainly thin but not very light, it weighs 150g. The weight feels good for a phone this size and it's all due to Nokia's legendary build quality. Part of that is the metal rim on the side of the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone has a 5" screen, as big as the Lumia 930 screen, but it's an IPS screen with 720p resolution. Viewing angles were great thanks to the IPS display as was the color rendering. The screen has 294ppi pixel density, which is just sharp enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The glass protecting the display is a sculpted Gorilla Glass 3 - the left and right sides of the display slope making swipes quite pleasant. The glass also integrates Nokia's ClearBlack tech, which reduces the reflectivity to improve sunlight legibility.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Let's get back to the camera, the defining feature of the Nokia Lumia 830. The super-thin OIS module is certainly impressive but the camera also boasts Zeiss optics, so far reserved for Nokia's royalty.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The camera has a 1/3.4" BSI sensor with 16:9 aspect ratio. The camera has an f/2.2 aperture and relatively wide 26mm focal length and a minimum focus distance of 10cm. You can use the two-stage shutter key to focus but also wake up the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We managed to sneak a quick camera sample with the Lumia 830 but keep in mind that lighting conditions are less than ideal.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 830 has an LED flash and with the new Rich capture mode you can chose whether the flash is enabled or not even days after you've taken the photo. To achieve that the special mode fires the flash but the camera takes photos both before and after that.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 830 camera records 1080p video at 30fps. There's 16GB of built-in storage to record your videos, expandable via microSD cards up to 128GB.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 400 chipset with a quad-core Cortex-A7 chipset. It will launch with Windows Phone 8.1 plus Lumia Denim update.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia 830 is powered by a 2,200mAh battery, almost the same size as the battery on the Lumia 930 despite being a full millimeter thinner. It has wireless charging built-in (again impressive at this thickness), which will work with the second-generation wireless charging accessory, more on that in a bit.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 830 will cost ?330 (before taxes and subsidies) when it starts shipping this month. As part of the promotion for all Lumias, you'll get free Skype Unlimited World subscription for three months.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 830 supports colorful back panels that can be popped on the phone to customize the look of the device. The color options for the phone itself include Black, White, Green and Orange, all of them matte (great news for opponents of glossy plastic).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: We've shot a few camera samples with the Nokia Lumia 830 from the IFA floor:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Nokia Lumia 730 and 735 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>In the Nokia Lumia 730 and 735 pair, the former is the 3G/dual-SIM version while the latter has 4G LTE connectivity. Both are all about selfie shots whether you take them with the front or the back camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Nokia took a shot at the famous selfie that Ellen took at the Oscars - it became the most retweeted image ever but Nokia said the camera it was taken with (the 2MP front-facing camera of a Samsung Galaxy Note 3) just wasn't good enough.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The front-facing camera on the Lumia 730/735 has a 5MP sensor and a wide-angle 24mm lens. This lets you fit more people into the shot.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Strangely, this camera only records 720p video but Nokia has optimized it for video calls (Skype limits video on mobiles to 720p anyway). Cortana, the Windows Phone digital assistant, can place a Skype video call for you - just trigger it with "Hey, Cortana" (new in Lumia Denim) and ask it to Skype one of your contacts. Again, all Lumias get three months of free Skype Unlimited World calling.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The main camera has an unusual resolution of 6.7MP and a Zeiss lens with a very wide f/1.9 aperture, matched only by the Lumia 720 camera. Unlike the front-facing camera, this one can record 1080p video.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Here's a quick photo we took with the Lumia 730. The lighting wasn't the best but we weren't allowed outside with the phone.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Lumia Selfie app can work with either camera - it uses face recognition tech to give you audio cues as you try to frame the shot. The Nokia Asha phones had a similar feature in the absence of a front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Selfie app will be prebundled on the 730/735 duo but is available today in the app store for all Lumia phones, including the Lumia 530 and Lumia 630, which don't have a front-facing camera.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Nokia Lumia 730 and 735 have 4.7" AMOLED screen of 720p resolution and ClearBlack.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The phone runs Windows Phone 8.1 with Lumia Denim on a Snapdragon 400 chipset with a quad-core 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 processor and 1GB RAM. A 2,220mAh battery provides the juice.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The dual-SIM Nokia Lumia 730 and the 4G LTE-enabled Nokia Lumia 735 will ship this month at euro;200 and ?220 respectively (before taxes and subsidies). The phones will come in Dark grey, Bright white, Bright orange and Bright green.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Update: We've shot a few camera samples with the Nokia Lumia 735:</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Accessories hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Nokia unveiled the second-generation of a wireless charging plate for use with its compatible handsets. The plate will come in orange, white and green (matching the Lumia 830 paint jobs) and is NFC-enabled for pairing. Once paired it talks to the phone via Bluetooth 4.0.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The charging plate has a built-in glow light and can, for example, glow a certain color while the battery charge is below a certain percentage. It can also blink in a pattern for notifications. Note that this works with Windows Phone 8.1 only.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Another new device is the Microsoft Screen sharing for Lumia Phones HD-10 (yes, Microsoft knows it's a mouthful). This is essentially a competitor to Google's Chromecast, it uses the Miracast standard to mirror the phone's screen on a TV.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has an NFC "coaster" that normally sits on the device and can be used to pair the HD-10 with a phone.</paragraph>
