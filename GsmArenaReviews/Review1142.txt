			<subsectionTitle>Introduction<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>Lenovo is having quite the showing at IFA 2016 too. The Moto Z lineup gets another member - the midrange Moto Z Play, accompanied by a 10x zoom Hasselblad camera True Zoom MotoMod, and there's a couple of new sleek Yoga convertibles (or three, if you count the Yoga Book's Android and Windows versions separately).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Before we move on to our first impressions, the usual rundown of the key specs is in order.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Then there is the Yoga Book, coming in your choice of OS, either Android Marshmallow, or Windows 10 Pro. For this 2 in 1 Lenovo chose to scrap the physical keyboard altogether, for better or worse, and instead go with a touch sensitive pad, which doubles as a virtual keyboard.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For a more conventional laptop experience there is the Yoga 910 - still fully convertible, but with a proper keyboard instead.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We'll kick off on the next page with the Moto Z Play and Hasselblad True Zoom Combo, as it's right up our alley, but the Yogas did get a few moments of hands-on time, so we'll share those as well.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Moto Z Play hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Moto Z Play is the latest member of the Z lineup this year complementing the Moto Z proper and Moto Z Force (add a 'Droid' moniker to those if you're in the US). The Moto Z Play carries a lot of the family traits, including the magnetic connectors on the back and a sizable camera hump.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Lenovo chose to announce a new Hasselblad-branded MotoMod alongside the Moto Z Play and that's the big news this time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But first things first. The Moto Z Play is a midrange smartphone that looks a lot like its more upmarket siblings with one notable difference - the back panel isn't made of metal, but glass.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Play is as thick as the Force at 7mm, and therefore thicker than the regular Moto Z's 5.2mm. In terms of weight, its 165g are virtually identical to the Force's 163g, both substantially heavier than the Moto Z (136g) - it's not just the numbers, the difference can be felt in hand.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The control layout is the same as the other Moto Z's and that means a textured power button on the right with volume up and down above it. The SIM/microSD card slot is on the top, and at the bottom next to the Type-C port there is a pleasant surprise - a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is missing on the higher-end models.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>On the front you have a fingerprint sensor below the display (not a Home button, mind you), which isn't too attractive, but does work quickly. The front-facing camera and the flash that accompanies it have traded sides on the Moto Z Play, compared to the other two models, but other than that, they're the same.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hasselblad's True Zoom snaps onto the back of the Moto Z Play (or any other of the Moto Z's, for that matter) just like the other MotoMods - via the magnetic connectors on the phone's back. Note that the add-on covers the handset's own camera completely - you need to remove the True Zoom in order to use the built-in shooter.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>With the Hasselblad on, the ensemble looks and feels a lot like a dedicated point-and-shoot camera, only with a very large display. It's quite hefty - the True Zoom is 145g on its own and simple math gives us a total of 310g.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The thing feels very well put together and handles nicely - the experience is miles ahead of single-handedly taking photos with a phone. The two stage-shutter button is also a boon to photography enthusiasts.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The 10x zoom lens extends when powered up, and zooming all the way to maximum telephoto makes it stick out even further, but that's to be expected. The 25-250mm zoom range is very useful, stretching from wide-angle for landscapes well into telephoto when you just can't get closer to your subject.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Even with a small 1/2.3" sensor such a range comes at the expense of aperture and the True Zoom is quite dim - f/3.5-6.5 means you'd better have plenty of light. The optical image stabilization should help, but even so outdoor in bright daylight sounds like the best environment for the Hasselblad.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We snapped some photos with the Hasselblad of course, and had a Galaxy Note7 for comparisons. The two have obviously exposed somewhat differently, but the Note7 benefits from its wider aperture, allowing it to use a faster shutter speed, thus minimizing the possibility for camera shake and motion blur.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The first set of images was shot at medium distance with no flash, while for the second pair we went up close and turned on the flashes.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>We also shot a bunch of other things with the Hasselblad to try and get a feel for its capabilities, but we're not exactly thrilled. That said, venue floors are never the best spot to examine a camera's performance, so we won't be judging it harshly for now.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>That's all we got from the Moto Z Play/Hassleblad True Zoom pair. Join us on the next page for some Yoga action.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Yoga Book hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>The Yoga Book is quite a head turner - after all you don't get to see 2 in 1 convertibles with virtual keyboards everyday. That's right, this one doesn't have a physical keyboard - instead, the entire non-display half of the device is a capacitive touch-sensitive area, that can function in a few different ways, depending on what you want to do with it.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Sure, you can use it for typing, though it's obviously an experience very remote to typing on an actual keyboard. In this case, a keyboard is projected on the pad (Lenovo has dubbed it a Halo keyboard), but you have no tactile feedback as to when a 'key' has been pressed - haptic isn't quite the same. Also, what sense does it make to have virtual nibs on the F and J keys, when you can't possibly feel them?</paragraph>
			<paragraph>A similar issue arises when using the touchpad. Putting aside the fact that it's quite small, you have no way of knowing where it ends other than looking at it, and you may often end up 'pressing' the space button.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>For all the downsides a virtual keyboard brings, the capacitive pad on the Yoga Book has a few neat tricks that you just can't otherwise get.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The device comes bundled with what Lenovo calls the Real Pen. It has interchangeable tips (ink pen, and pencil, for example) and you can use it to write or draw with actual ink on actual paper on top of the touch-sensitive pad, and the Yoga Book will digitize it for you. There's a clip to hold your paper in place, too.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>But if you think paper is obsolete, you can always just go ahead and use the Real Pen directly on the Creative Pad itself. That way the you can use both hands at the same time, drawing with one, and using the other on the display to do stuff around the interface. It's a little counter intuitive to draw in one place, and have the result appear in another, though.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The Yoga Book can be had in one of two OS flavors - either Windows 10, or Android Marshmallow. A cool bit about the Android version is that Lenovo has implemented a window mode support - that should arrive natively with Nougat, but Lenovo apparently has custom-built it in.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Also be sure to check out the brief video below for more on the Yoga Book.</paragraph>

			<subsectionTitle>Lenovo Yoga 910 hands-on<subsectionTitle>
			<paragraph>We also spent some time with the Yoga 910 - a more serious machine by all accounts. This one has a proper keyboard, a usable-sized display, and in its top spec it can be equipped with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and a terabyte of SSD storage.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>It has a great display, 4K resolution is obviously very sharp at that 13.9-inch diagonal, and the minimal bezels on three out of four sides really make it stand out.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>After the odd experience on the Yoga Book's virtual keyboard, the one on the 910 was a joy to use, and we appreciated the groove that the dedicated touchpad has to let fingertips know where its boundaries are. There's also a fingerprint reader on the 910 for an extra bit of security.</paragraph>
